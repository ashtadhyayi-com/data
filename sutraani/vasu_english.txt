{
    "11001": "This defines the word <i>vriddhi</i>. The letters आ, ऐ and औ are <i>vriddhi</i> letters. The <i>sutra</i> consists of three words <i>vriddhi</i>, <i>ât</i> and <i>aich</i>. आत् means the long आ, the final त् being indicatory only, and is for the sake of the <i>pratyâhâra</i> <i>aich</i>, and the <i>pratyâhâra</i> ऐच् means the letters ऐ and औ.\n\nThe indicatory त् in आत् serves the purpose of showing that the very form आ having two <i>måtrâs</i> or prosodial measure, is to be taken. This त् also joins with the succeeding vowels ऐ and औ by the rule of तपर [[1.1.70]] or that \"which precedes or succeeds त्\" and indicates that these vowels must be taken as having two <i>mâtrâs</i> only, though they may be the result of the combination of vowels whose aggregate <i>mâtrâs</i> may be more than two. A short vowel has one <i>måtrâ</i>, a long vowel has two, and a consonant has half a <i>mátrâ</i>. Thus by a rule of arm or euphonic conjunction of letters आ+आ=आ, as महा + आशयः = महाशयः. Here हा has two <i>mâtrâs</i> and not four. So also खट्वैडकः the vowel ऐ the resultant of आ+ऐ has only two, not four, <i>mâtrâs</i>.\n\nThus the initial vowels in the following secondary derivative nouns are <i>vriddhi</i> forms of their primitive vowels. आङ्गः \"bodily\", from अङ्गः; 'body' ऐच्छिकः \"optional\", from इच्छा \"option\"; औपगवः \"the son of <i>Upagu</i>\", from the word उपगुः meaning \"a sage called <i>Upagu</i>\". Similarly in शालीयः \"belonging to the house\" the आ is radical, and is also called <i>vriddhi</i>. The word <i>vriddhi</i> occurs in <i>sûtras</i> like सिचिवृद्धिपरस्मैपदेषु [[7.2.1]] \"Let the final इक् of the base get <i>vriddhi</i> substitute before the affix सिच् of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>\".",
    "11002": "Each one of the letters अ, ए and ओ whether radical or secondary is called a <i>guna</i> letter; as the initial vowels in the following:- अर्त्ति,\"he moves\"; एति \"he comes\", ओखति \"he goes.\" Here the initial vowels of the roots ऋ, इ, and उख् have been respectively <i>gunated</i> into अर्, ए, and ओ before the third person singular termination ति.\n\nThe term <i>Guna</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> like मिदेर्गुणः [[7.3.82]]. \"Let there be <i>guna</i> substitute for the <i>ik</i> of the root मिद् \"to melt.\"",
    "11003": "This is a <i>paribhasha</i> <i>sutra</i>, and is useful in determining the original letters, in the place of which the substitute <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> letters will come. The present rule will apply where there is the specification of no other particular rule.\n\nThus <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.84]] declares:- \"when a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> or an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows there is <i>guna</i> of the base.\" Here the <i>sthani</i> or the original expression which is to be <i>gunated</i>, is not specified, and to complete the sense, the word \"<i>ikah</i>\" must be read into the <i>sutra</i>. The rule then being, \"when a S. or an A. affix follows there is <i>guna</i> of the <i>ik</i> vowels of the base.\" The <i>guna</i> of इ or ई is ए; of उ or ऊ, is ओ, of ऋ or ॠ is अर्, of ऌ is अल्; and their <i>Vrddhi</i> is ऐ, औ, आर् and आल् respectively. Thus नी + अति = ने + अति = नयति \"he leads.\"\n\nTherefore, wherever in any rule in this Grammar, <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> is ordained by employing the terms <i>guņa</i> or <i>vriddhi</i>, there the word \"<i>ikah</i>\" in the genitive case, meaning \"in the place of <i>ik</i>\", is to be supplied to complete the sense.\n\nThe word '<i>ik</i>' is thus understood in the following rules, and is there qualified by the term अङ्ग or 'base':- मिदेर्गुणः [[7.3.82]] मृजेर्वृद्धिः [[7.2.114]] पुगन्तलघूपध &c., [[7.3.86]]; ऋच्छत्यॄताम् [[7.4.11]] ऋदृशोऽङि गुणः [[7.4.16]] स्थूलदूरयुव &c., [[6.4.156]].\n\nIn the following <i>sutras</i>, the term '<i>ik</i>' is understood and qualifies the word <i>ånga</i> or base, जुसि च [[7.3.83]], सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोः [[7.3.84]].\n\nThese <i>sutras</i> will be explained in their proper places.\n\nThe word '<i>ik</i>' has been used in the <i>sutra</i> to show that the long आ, एच् or the diphthongs and हल् or the consonants, are not to take <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> by this rule, as in the following examples यानम् \"a carriage\", ग्लायति \"he feels aversion\", उम्भिता \"confined\".\n\nHere ग्लायति is formed by adding the affix तिप्, third person singular termination, with the class a affix शप्, to the root ग्लै; as ग्लै+शप्+तिप्=ग्लै+अ+ति. At this stage, rule [[7.3.84]], would require the <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel of the base before the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> termination अ; the <i>guna</i> substitute of ऐ being ए, there would be ग्ले+अति=ग्लयति. But this is wrong, the letter ऐ, being not included in the <i>pratyâhåra</i> <i>ik</i>, is not affected by rule [[7.3.84]], and there is no <i>guna</i> substitution in this case. Similarly there is no change in the long आ of यानम्. Thus या+ल्युट् [[3.3.115]] = यानम् [[7.1.1]]. Here had there been <i>guņa</i> by Rule [[7.3.84]], the आ of या, would have been changed into अ, and the form would have been यनम् which is wrong. But it is not so, as आ is not an इक् vowel. So also उम्भ्+इता = उम्भिता. Here, there is no <i>guna</i> substitution in the place of the consonant भ्.\n\nThe repetition of the words <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> in this <i>sútra</i>, (though by अनुवृत्ति or the supplying of a word from the previous <i>sūtra</i>, these words followed from the two preceding <i>sutras</i>) is for the purpose of indicating that, this is a restrictive rule applicable only there, where <i>guņa</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> has been ordained by the employment of the words <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i>. Therefore, it is not so in the following cases :- द्यौः \"sky\", पन्थाः \"way\" सः \"he,\" इमम् \"this\". द्यौः is the nominative singular of the base दिव्. It is formed by rule [[7.1.84]], which declares that \"in the nominative singular the letter औ takes the place of दिव्\". Here the letter औ is no doubt a <i>vriddhi</i> letter, but as this substitution is not enjoined by the enunciation of the term <i>vriddhi</i>, औ does not take the place of the vowel इ of दिव्, but it replaces the final व्. Thus दि+औ+स्=द्यौः.\n\nSimilarly rule [[7.1.85]], declares that of the word पथिन्, आ is the substitute. The आ is a <i>vriddhi</i> letter no doubt, but not being enunciated by the term <i>vriddhi</i>, it takes the place of न् of पथिन् and not of इ. Thus we have पन्थाः, the न being added by [[7.1.87]].\n\nSimilarly सः from तद्, which is formed by [[7.2.102]] \"short अ is the substitute of <i>tyad</i>, &c.,\" Here अ takes the place of द्. Thus we have त, which is changed again into स by [[7.2.106]].",
    "11004": "This is an exception to <i>sūtra</i> 3. By that <i>sūtra</i> <i>iks</i> were to be <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i> and by <i>sūtra</i> [[7.3.84]], the root is to be <i>gunated</i> before all <i>ardhadhatuka</i> terminations. All primary affixes, that are applied directly to roots in Sanskrit, are divided into two broad classes, called <i>sårvadhâtuka</i> and <i>årdhadhâtuka</i>. The affixes marked with an indicatory श (called शित्), and the conjugational affixes, such as तिप्, तः &c., (called तिङ्) are <i>sårvadhatuka</i>; all other affixes are called <i>årdhadhâtuka</i>.\n\nThough by the general rule, [[7.3.84]], the root is to be <i>gunated</i> before <i>årdhadhâtuka</i> terminations, yet it is not to be so, before those affixes which cause the लोप 'lopping off or ellipses' of a portion or a member of the original <i>dhấtu</i>. Thus the termination स्यामि is a first person singular termination of the future tense ( लृट् ) and is an <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> termination; when this is added to root जि 'to excel' the इ of जि becomes <i>gunated</i> and we have जेष्यामि \"I shall or will excel.\" But in those cases where there is a <i>lopa</i> of the member of a root form, caused by an affix, there is no <i>guṇation</i>. Thus in लोलुवः \"a great cutter\", the original root is लू \"to cut\" which forms the Intensive verb लोलूय. In forming the noun of agency from the verb लोलूय, an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> suffix अच् [[3.1.134]], is added. Thus लोलूय+अच्. At this stage, by force of <i>sūtra</i> [[2.4.74]] which declares that \"before the affix अच् [[3.1.134]] the य of the Intensive verb must be suppressed,\" the <i>ya</i> is dropped and we have लोलू+अ. Here by the general rule [[7.3.84]], the final ऊ would have been <i>gunated</i>. But by virtue of the present <i>sūtra</i>, no <i>guna</i> takes place, because here on account of the <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> affix अच्, a portion of the root, namely, य, has been elided; therefore no <i>guņa</i> takes place. Thus we have लोलुवः \"a great cutter.\"\n\nThe word धातु \"root\" has been used in the <i>sûtra</i>, in order to indicate that the exception does not apply where there is an elision of an <i>anubandha</i> or of an affix. As in लूञ्+इता = लो+इता = लविता. Here the indicatory letter ञ् has been elided, but that does not prevent <i>gunation</i>. Similarly in रेड् the affix विच् is added to the root रिष् \"to injure.\" Thus रिष्+विच् [[3.2.75]] = रिष्+व् [[1.3.2]] and [[1.3.3]] = रिष्+० [[6.1.67]]. Here the affix व् is elided, but nevertheless, the <i>guṇa</i> substitute must take place in रिष्. Thus we have रिष्+० = रेष् [[7.3.86]] and [[1.1.62]] = रेड् [[8.2.39]].\n\nThe word <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> has been used to indicate that a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix which causes the elision of a portion of a root, does not prevent <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> as in रोरवीति, (<i>Rig Veda</i> IV.58.3) \"he roars much\". रू+यङ् = रोरुव [[3.1.22]]. रोरुय+तिप् = रोरु+ति [[2.4.74]]. Here the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix तिप् causes the elision of य, a portion of the root. The <i>guna</i> substitution however takes place, and we have रोरो+ई+ति [[7.3.94]] = रोरवीति, the augment ईट् being added by <i>sūtra</i> [[7.3.94]].\n\nThe word \"<i>ikah</i>\" of the previous <i>sūtra</i> is understood in this <i>sūtra</i> also. The <i>ik</i> letters only are not <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i> before such <i>ardhadbatuka</i> affixes; the other vowels may do so. Thus in अभाजि the equation is as follows:- अ+भञ्ज्+चिण् = अ+भज्+इ [[6.4.33]]. Here the <i>ardhadhátuka</i> affix चिण् has caused a portion of the root भञ्ज्, to be suppressed, vis., the letter ञ् has been elided. But nevertheless the अ of भज् is <i>vriddhied</i> before चिण् because अ is not included in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>ik</i> ; and the exception contained in the present <i>sutra</i> only applies to the <i>ik</i> letters. So also रञ्ज्+घञ् [[3.3.18]] = रज्+अ [[6.4.27]] = रागः [[7.2.116]] and [[7.3.52]].",
    "11005": "Thus the past participle terminations क्त and क्तवतु are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes, which would, by the general rule [[7.3.84]], have caused <i>guna</i>, but as their indicatory letter क is इत्, the real terminations being, त and तवत्, they do not cause <i>guna</i>. Therefore, when these terminations are added to a root, the <i>ik</i> of the root is not <i>gunated</i>. Thus with the root चि \"to collect\" we have चितः or चितवान्, श्रू, \"to hear\", श्रुतः, श्रुतवान्; भी; \"to fear\" भीतः, भीतवान्.\n\nSimilarly the terminations क्यप् केलिम, क्वसु कानच्, क्त्वा, क्तिन्, &c., are all कित् terminations 'the indicatory letters of all being क्,' the real affixes being य, एलिम्, वस् &c. &c. &c. Before these, the root is not <i>gunated</i>. Thus we have from भृ \"to bear\" भृत्व, from भिद् \"to pierce\" भिदेलिम.\n\nThe terms कित् &c., of this <i>sûtra</i> are in the locative or seventh case. The force of this case termination here is that of निमित or cause, that is the <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> which would otherwise have been caused, does not take place, if an affix is कित्, गित्, ङित्. Thus all <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> and <i>sårvadhatuka</i> affixes cause <i>gunation</i> of the final <i>ik</i> of the inflective base (VII.3.84.) Thus the <i>Sårvadhâtuka</i> affix शप्(अ) in the following:-\n\nभू+शप्+तिप् = भो+अ+ति = भवति \"he is.\" Similarly <i>sårvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardbadhâtuka</i> affixes cause the <i>guna</i> substitution of the short penultimate <i>ik</i> of the inflective base [[7.3.85]]. Thus बुध्+शप्+तिप् = बोधति.\n\nThe general force of the locative case in an aphorism is to cause the operation directed, on the expression immediately preceding it [[1.1.66]]. If the force of the locative case in the present <i>sūtra</i> were also that as explained in [[1.1.66]], then the interpretation would be this:- An affix having an indicatory <i>k</i>, <i>g</i> or <i>ṅ</i>, would not cause the <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel <i>ik</i>, immediately preceding it. The case of the penultimate short <i>ik</i> will not be covered by it. Then though the rule may apply to चि+क्त=चितः \"collected\" it would not apply to भिद्+क्त; there would be nothing to bar the <i>guna</i> substitution of the penultimate इ of भिद्. This however is prevented by explaining the locative as one of \"occasion\" and thus भिद्+क्त = भिन्नः \"broken.\"\n\nSimilarly from the root जि we have a word जिष्णुः 'victorious', in which the affix ग्स्नु has an indicatory ग्. Thus जि+ग्स्नु = जिष्णुः \"victorious\" [[3.2.139]], so also स्थास्नुः \"durable,\"\n\nSimilarly the affix, अङ् is a ङित् affix, the real suffix being अ, the ङ् being merely indicatory. Therefore when अङ् is added to a root, there is no <i>gunation</i> or <i>vriddhing</i>. Thus we have from विद् \"to know\" विदः.\n\nSimilarly by [[1.2.4]], all <i>sårvadhâtuka</i> affixes that are not marked by an indicatory प्, are treated as ङित्. Thus the second person singular termination तस् is ङित्, and we have चिनुतः \"they two collect,\" similarly चिन्वन्ति, \"they collect\", मृज्+क्त = मृष्टः \"cleansed,\" मृजन्ति \"they cleanse.\"\n\nThe phrase \"when indicated by the term <i>ik</i>\" is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The prohibition, therefore, applies to <i>ik</i> vowels only, and not to all vowels in general. Thus by [[3.1.30]], the root कम् \"to desire\" takes the affix णिङ्; of this affix the letters ण् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is इ. The force of ण् is to cause <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.116]]. The indicatory ङ् does not prevent such <i>vriddhi</i>, as the letter अ of कम् is not included in <i>ik</i>. Thus we have कामि+अते = कामे+अते = कामयते \"he desires\".\n\nAccording to the wish of the author of the <i>Mahabhashya</i>, the verb मृज् optionally takes <i>vriddhi</i>, before <i>kit</i> or <i>ṅit</i> affixes beginning with a vowel. As परिमृजन्ति or परिमार्जन्ति \"they rub.\" Here in this <i>sūtra</i> there is prohibition of the <i>guna</i> of the short penultimate <i>ik</i> also.\n\nThe indicatory ङ् of the verbal tense affixes i.e., लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ् is an exception to this rule of ङित्. This is an inference deduced from [[3.4.104]] which declares \"when the sense is that of benediction, then the augment यासुट् of लिङ् is as if it were distinguished by an indicatory क.\" There would have been no necessity of making यासुट् a कित्, if लिङ् were a ङित्, but the very fact of making यासुट् a कित् indicates by implication or is ज्ञापक that the final ङ of लिङ्, लङ् &c. does not make these tense affixes ङित्. Thus in लङ् or Imperfect tense we have अचिनवम् \"he collected\" (अचिनू+लङ् = अचिनु+अम् = अचिनो+अम् = अचिनवम्.)",
    "11006": "The roots दीधी and वेवी never take the <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> substitutions under ordinary circumstances. Thus the affix ण्वुल् generally causes <i>vriddhi</i> substitution when added to any root; and so the affix ल्युट् causes <i>guņa</i>. But these affixes when applied to the verbs <i>didhi</i> and <i>vevi</i>, never cause <i>vřiddhi</i> or <i>guna</i> substitution. As आदीधी+ण्वुल् = आदीधी+अक [[7.1.1]] = आदीध्वकः [[6.1.77]]. So also आदीधी+ल्युट् = आदीधी+अन [[7.1.1]] = आदीध्वनम्. Similarly from वेवी we have आवेव्यनम् and आवेव्यकः. In the Vedas, however, these verbs take <i>guna</i>. Thus अदीधेत् (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. X.98.7), and अदीधयुः (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. V.40.5). These two verbs are confined generally to the Vedic literature, and the present rule therefore, seems to be an unnecessary prohibition; as they take <i>guna</i> in spite of such prohibition.\n\nOf the augment इट् the real affix is इ. In the general tenses, it is added to certain terminations beginning with consonants of the वल् class, i.e., all consonants except य [[7.2.35]]. Thus the future termination, first person, singular is स्यामि; this when added to the root चर् \"to move\" requires an intermediate इ, and thus we have the form चरिष्यामि, 'I shall walk.' This इ is never <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i>, though according to the general rule, coming before an <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> termination, it ought to have been <i>gunated</i>.\n\nThe augment इट्, could under no circumstances have taken <i>vriddhi</i>, the prohibition therefore, is in the case of the <i>guna</i> substitute of इट्.",
    "11007": "This defines the word <i>sanyoga</i>. The <i>sûtra</i> consists of three words, हलः, the plural of the <i>pratyåhåra</i> हल्, denoting all the consonants, अनन्तरः means \"without any separation or space\" and संयोगः which is the word defined, and means \"conjunct consonants.\" So that the <i>sūtra</i> means, conjunct consonants are those consonants between which there is no heterogeneous separating vowel and which are pronounced jointly, such as क्क in the word कुक्कुटः, \"cock.\" The word \"<i>sanyoga</i>\" applies to the whole of the conjunct consonants jointly and not to them separately. The plural number shows that the conjunction may be of two or more consonants.\n\nWhy do we say \"consonant\"? If two vowels come together they will not be called \"sanyoga\". Thus तितउच्छत्रं \"a sieve umbrella\", the two vowels अ and उ have come together unseparated by any consonant; yet they are not called <i>sanyoga</i>, otherwise the final उ would have been rejected by [[8.2.23]] \"there is elision of the final of that <i>pada</i> which ends in a <i>sanyoga</i> letter.\" Why do we say \"unseparated by a vowel\"? If consonants separated by a vowel were also called <i>sanyoga</i>, then in the sentence पचति पनसम्, the syllable सम् would be called <i>sanyoga</i>, and by [[8.2.29]], the initial स would be elided.",
    "11008": "This defines the word <i>anunåsika</i>. The <i>sûtra</i> consists of four words मुख \"mouth\" नासिका \"nose\" वचनः \"utterance or pronunciation\" and अनुनासिकः \"nasals.\" Though the words मुख + नासिका [[2.4.2]] will by the rule of composition form मुखनासिकं and not मुखनासिका, yet the latter form might be held to be an irregularity; or the phrase मुखनासिकावचनं may be regarded as a compound of मुखनासिक+आवचनं, the word <i>avachana</i> meaning \"partial utterance.\" That is a letter partially uttered by the nose and partially by the mouth would be called <i>anunåsika</i>. Therefore the nasals are those letters which are pronounced from two organs or places, i.e., the mouth and the nose. The pure nasal is <i>anusvåra</i>, while <i>anunasikas</i> are different from this, in as much as, that in pronouncing these, the breath passes through the nose and the mouth.\n\nThe vowels are generally so nasalised. 'If, instead of emitting the vowel sound freely through the mouth, we allow the velum pendulum to drop and the air to vibrate through the cavities which connect the nose with the pharynx, we hear the nasal vowels (<i>anunåsika</i>).' Thus अँ, आँ. In the Vedas, the particle आङ् is <i>anunåsika</i>. As अभ्र आँ अपः (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>. V.48.1), so also पर्षि॑ दी॒ने ग॑भी॒र आँ उग्र॑पुत्रे॒ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. VIII. 67. 11).\n\nThe consonants ङ, ञ, ण, न and म are also <i>anunåsika</i>. Thus ङ is pronounced by the throat along with the nose, ञ by the palate and nose, ण by the upper palate and nose; न by the teeth and nose, and म by the lip and nose.\n\nThe semi-vowels य, न and ल are also nasalised and are then called <i>anunåsika</i>. The term <i>anunåsika</i> is used in <i>sūtra</i> [[5.1.126]] &c.\n\nWhy have we used the word \"by the mouth\"? This definition will not include <i>anusvåra</i> or the pure nasal, which is pronounced wholly through the nose. Why have we used the word \"by the nose\"? In order to exclude the consonants क, च, ट, त, प &c. &c., which are pronounced wholly and solely through the mouth.",
    "11009": "This defines the word <i>savarna</i> or a homogeneous letter. The <i>sūtra</i> consists of four words :- तुल्य \"equal or similar,\" आस्य \"mouth or place of pronunciation,\" प्रयत्न \"effort\" and सवर्णम् \"words of the same class.\"\n\nThe आस्य or places or portions of the mouth by contact with which various sounds are formed are chiefly the following :- 1. कण्ठ \"throat\" 2. तालु 'palate,' 3. मूर्द्धा, 'head,' 4. दन्ताः 'teeth,' 5. ओष्ठौ 'lips,' 6. नासिका 'nose.'\n\nThe प्रयत्नम् or quality or effort is of two sorts primarily, आभ्यन्तरः \"internal\" and बाह्यः \"external.\" The first is again sub-divided into five parts:-\n\n1. स्पृष्टम् or complete contact of the organs. The twenty-five letters from क to म belong to this class. In pronouncing these there is a complete contact of the root of the tongue with the various places, such as throat, palate, dome of the palate, teeth and lip.\n\n2. ईषत्स्पृष्टम् or slight contact. The letters य, र, ल, व belong to this class of contacts. \"In pronouncing these semi-vowels the two organs, the active and passive, which are necessary for the production of all consonantal noises, are not allowed to touch each other, but only to approach.\"\n\n3. विवृतम् or complete opening. The vowels belong to this class.\n\n4. ईषद् विवृतम् or slight opening. The letters श, ष, स, ह belong to this class. Some however place the vowels and श &c., into one group and call them all <i>vivrita</i>.\n\n5. संवृतम् or contracted. In actual use, the organ in the enunciation of the short अ is contracted but it is considered to be open only, as in the case of the other vowels, when the vowel अ is in the state of taking part in some operation of grammar.\n\nThe <i>abhyantara</i> <i>prayatna</i> is the mode of articulation preparatory to the utterance of the sound, the <i>båhya</i>-<i>prayatna</i> is the mode of articulation at the close of the utterance of the sound.\n\nThe division of letters according to <i>abhyantra</i> <i>prayatna</i> has been already given. By that we get, 1. the <i>sparsa</i> or mute letters, 2. the <i>antastha</i> or intermediate between <i>sparsas</i> and <i>ushmans</i>, or semi-vowel or liquid letters, 3. the <i>svaras</i> or vowels or <i>vivrita</i> letters, 4. the <i>ushmans</i> or sibilants or flatus letters.\n\nThe division of letters according to <i>båhya</i> <i>prayatna</i> gives us first surds or <i>aghosha</i> letters, 2. sonants or <i>ghosha</i> letters. The <i>aghosha</i> are also called <i>svasa</i> letters, the <i>ghoshas</i> are called <i>nåda</i> letters.\n\nThe second division of letters according to <i>båhya</i> <i>prayatna</i> is into;\n\n1. Aspirated (<i>mahåprana</i>). 2. Unaspirated (<i>alpaprana</i>).\n\nThe vowel अ has eighteen forms. The acute अ (<i>udatta</i>), grave अ (<i>anudatta</i>) and circumflexed अ ( <i>svarita</i>). Each one of these three may be nasalised (<i>anunasika</i>), or not (<i>niranunasika</i>).\n\nThen lastly everyone of these six may be short, long, or prolated. Thus:- अ, अ॒, अ॑, अँ, अँ॒, अँ॑, आ, आ॒, आ॑, आँ, आँ॒, आँ॑, अ३, अ॒३, अ॑३, अँ३, अँ॒३, अँ॑३.\n\nSimilarly the letters इ, उ and ऋ have also eighteen forms. The letter ऌ has no long form; it has therefore 12 modifications. The diphthongs have no short forms, they have therefore, only 12 forms. The <i>antastha</i> or semi-vowels with the exception of र have two forms each vis., nasalised and un-nasalised. The semi-vowels have no homogeneous letters corresponding to them. All letters of a <i>varga</i> or 'class' are homogeneous to each other.\n\nThus then the homogeneous or <i>savarna</i> letters must satisfy two conditions before they could be called <i>savarna</i>. First, their place of pronunciation or आस्य must be the same. Secondly their प्रयत्न or quality must be equal. If one condition be present and the other be absent, there can be no <i>savarna</i>-hood. Thus च and श are both palatals, their आस्य or place of pronunciation being तालु 'palate', but still they are not <i>savarna</i>, because their प्रयत्न is different, the प्रयत्न of च being <i>sprishta</i> and that of श being <i>vivrita</i>.\n\nSimilarly क and च though their प्रयत्न is the same i.e., <i>sprishta</i>, yet their आस्य being different, one being guttural and the other palatal, are not <i>savarna</i>.\n\nThere is exception to this rule in the case of ऋ and ऌ, which though having different आस्य are still called <i>savarna</i> by virtue of the <i>varttika</i> of <i>Katyayana</i>; \"the homogeneousness of ऋ and ऌ , one with another, should be stated.\" Thus होतृ+ऌकारः = होतॄकारः ; here ऋ and ऌ have coalesced into long ॠ by rules of <i>sandhi</i>, on the assumption that they are <i>savarna</i> letters.\n\nThe word <i>savarna</i> occurs in <i>sůtras</i> like अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः [[6.1.101]].\n\nWhy do we say \"the place of pronunciation\"? So that there may not be homogeneous relationship between कचटत and प whose <i>prayatna</i> is the same but whose <i>åsya</i> is different. What is the harm if we make them <i>savarna</i>? Then in words like तर्प्ता and तर्प्तुम्, the प would be elided, if it be held homogeneous with त, by [[8.4.65]], \"there is optional elision of झर्, preceded by a consonant, when a homogeneous झर् follows.\"\n\nWhy do we say \"effort\"? That there may be no homogeneity between इ and the palatals, and य and श, whose organ of pronunciation is the same, but whose <i>prayatna</i> is different. What harm if it be so ? Then in अरुश्च्योतति, the श would be elided before च by the rule already referred to, [[8.4.65]].",
    "11010": "This <i>sutra</i> lays down an exception to the former <i>sutra</i>. There can be no homogeneity or <i>savarna</i> relationship between vowels and consonants, though their आस्य and प्रयत्न may be the same. Thus इ and श have the same आस्य namely तालु 'palate,' and the same प्रयत्नः namely <i>vivrita</i>, but still they are not to be called <i>savarna</i>. Thus in दण्डहस्त, दधिशीतलं &c., the letters अ and ह in the first example, and इ and श in the second not being homogeneous letters; there is no combination or <i>sandhi</i>, which would otherwise have taken place.\n\nSimilarly if श and इ be held homogeneous, then विपाश+अण् [[4.3.53]] = विपाश्+अण् [[6.4.148]]; here श would be elided by [[6.4.148]], but it is not so and we have वैपाशः \"belonging to <i>vipåså</i> or born therein.\" So also in आनडुहं \"ox-skin,\" the ह would have been omitted, if held homogeneous with अ.",
    "11011": "As a general rule, Sanskrit allows of no hiatus in a sentence. If a word ends in a vowel, and the next word begins with a vowel, the two vowels coalesce, according to certain rules. This is called <i>sandhi</i>. But <i>pragrihyas</i> are exceptions to this <i>sandhi</i>, \"they are certain terminations, the final vowels of which are not liable to any <i>sandhi</i> rules.\" [[6.1.125]]. This <i>sutra</i> gives three of these terminations, viz., the duals of nouns or verbs ending in ई (ईत्), ऊ (ऊत्), ए (एत्). Thus:- कवी इमौ \"these two poets,\" so also वायू इति \"two winds;\" माले इति \"these two garlands.\" पचेते इति \"they two cook\" पचेथे इति \"you two cook.\" Here according to the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>, the final इ of कवी and the initial इ of इमौ ought to have coalesced into an ई, but it is not so, because कवी is the nominative dual of कवि.\n\nWhy do we say ending in <i>ī</i>, <i>ū</i> and <i>e</i>? Because when the dual ends in any other vowel this rule will not apply. As वृक्षौ+अत्र = वृक्षावत्र, \"these two trees\" [[6.1.78]]. Of course it follows from the definition, that ई, ऊ, or ए of the dual number only are <i>pragrihya</i>; if these vowels terminate any other number they will not be <i>pragřihya</i> but will follow the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>, as कुमारी (I.S.) + अत्र = कुमार्य्यत्र, \"the girl is here\" [[6.1.77]].\n\n<i>Vart</i>: The prohibition of मनीव &c., should be stated in treating of the <i>pragrihya</i> nature of ई, ऊ &c. Thus मनी (two gems) + इव = मनीव \"like two gems\". So also दम्पतीव \"like a couple,\" जम्पतीव \"like man and wife,\" रोदसीव \"like heaven and earth.\" Some say that this <i>vårtika</i> is unneccessary. Because the final member of the above words is not इव, but the particle व only; which has the same meaning as <i>iva</i>.",
    "11012": "In the pronoun अदस्, the dual termination in ई, ऊ or ए will be <i>pragrihya</i> by force of the last <i>sūtra</i>, but the present <i>sûtra</i> makes this addition, that in the case of अदस्, all terminations ending in ई, ऊ or ए and preceded by म, of whatever number they may be, will be <i>pragrihya</i>. As a matter of fact, there are only two such terminations satisfying the above conditions namely अमी and अमू. The rule may therefore be put in the following words of Dr. Max Muller:- \"The terminations of अमी and अमू nom. plur. masc. and nom. dual of the pronoun अदस् are <i>pragrihya</i>.\" As अमी अश्वाः \"Those horses\", and अमू आसते. There is no example of the word <i>adas</i> ending in ए.\n\nWhy do we say \"of the word <i>adas</i>\"? The letters ई, ऊ, ए following after the म् of any other word will not be <i>pragrihya</i>. As शमी+अत्र = शम्यत्र \"this <i>sami</i> tree.\"\n\nWhy do we say \"after the letter म्\"? Because in the example अमुके+अत्र = अमुकेऽत्र, \"those here,\" the ए, preceded not by म् but by the क of अकच् [[5.3.71]] is not <i>pragrihya</i>, which it would have been by the influence of <i>sūtra</i> II, which includes ए as well as ई and ऊ, and from which the word dual is not supplied here, else this rule would be useless.",
    "11013": "In the Vedic Sanskrit, the declension of nouns sometimes differs somewhat from the ordinary Sanskrit. One of the peculiar Vedic terminations, which replace the ordinary declensional terminations is called शे [[7.1.39]]. Thus अस्मेइन्द्राबृहस्पती.\n\nOf this substitute शे, the initial श is indicatory, the real suffix being ए. This final ए is a <i>pragrihya</i>.\n\nIn the sacred literature there is only one example of this <i>pragrihya</i>, as given above; while in imitation of this, we have in secular writing phrases as, त्वेइति, युष्मे इति, मे इति &c.",
    "11014": "This <i>sūtra</i> consists of three words: निपातः \"particle\", एकाच् \"consisting of one vowel,\" अनाङ् \"with the exception of आङ्.\"\n\nAll such particles technically called <i>nipäta</i> [[1.4.56]] which consist of a simple vowel without any consonant, are <i>pragřihya</i> and therefore are not liable to the rules of <i>sandhi</i>. As इ इन्द्र \"Oh, <i>Indra</i>\" उ उत्तिष्ठ \"O arise.\"\n\nIt follows from the above definition that those <i>nipätas</i> which consist of two or more letters, vowel and consonant, are not <i>pragrihya</i>, e. g. प्र in प्राग्नये वाचमीरय.\n\nआङ् which is not a <i>pragrihya</i>, has four significations:- As a diminutive particle when joined to adjectives and nouns, as आ+उष्णम् = ओष्णम् \"little hot, tepid\" (2) as a prefix to verbs, it expresses the senses of \"near\" \"nearto,\" and with verbs of \"motion,\" \"taking\" &c., it shows the reverse of the action, as गम् 'to go', आगम 'to come;' आ+इहि = एहि, (3) as showing the limit inceptive (अभिविधि) \"from,\" \"ever since,\" as आजन्मनः \"ever since his birth,\" (4) as showing the limit exclusive (मर्यादा), \"till\" \"until\" as आ+अध्ययनात् = आध्ययनात्, \"until the reading begins.\" When the particle आ has not any one of the above four senses and is used in expressing regret &c., it is a <i>pragrihya</i>, as आ एवं किलासीत् \"Ah! such there once was\", आ एवं मन्यसे \"Oh! do you think so.\"\n\nThe word एकाच् in this aphorism has a peculiar meaning. It means \"consisting of one vowel and nothing else.\" In other words, the vowels themselves when used as निपात, e. g. आ, उ, इ &c. But the term एकाच् has a wider signification than that given to it in this <i>sūtra</i>. It means \"a word or a portion of a word consisting of one vowel which can be pronounced at once\"- in other words एकाच् means a \"syllable\". In that sense the words प्र, नि, वि &c., will also be एकाच्, but not so here. Therefore the rule of <i>sandhi</i> will apply to them, thus प्राग्नये वाचमीरय. See <i>sūtra</i> [[6.1.1]] where the word एकाच् means a monosyllable.\n\nWhy do we say \"a <i>nipata</i>?\" Because if the single vowel is not a particle, but something else, an affix &c., then it will not be a <i>pragrihya</i>, as the final अ in चकार \"he did\", is the affix of third person perfect tense, and is liable to <i>sandhi</i>; as चकारात्र.",
    "11015": "This <i>sútra</i> consists of one word ओत् the final त् is a surplusage. The words \"<i>pragrihya</i>\" and \"<i>nipåta</i>\" are to be supplied from the preceding <i>sutras</i> to complete the sense. The meaning is that those particles which end in ओ though consisting of several letters, are <i>pragrihya</i>. As अहो अपेहि \"Halloo, go away.\"",
    "11016": "This <i>sūtra</i> gives the opinion of the <i>Rishi</i> <i>Sakalya</i>, so that it is an optional rule. Thus both forms वायविति (formed according to the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>) and वायो इति (where ओ is <i>pragrihya</i>) are correct.\n\nIn <i>ârsha</i> literature the <i>sandhi</i> is imperative, not optional, as एता गा ब्रह्मबन्धवित्यब्रवीत्.\n\nThe mention of the name of any sage, such as that of <i>Sakalya</i> in this <i>sūtra</i>, serves generally one of the two purposes :- (1) either it makes the rule an optional one, <i>vibhåshartham</i>, or (2) the mention is merely for the sake of showing respect to the particular sage, the rule would have stood as well without such mention; <i>pujártham</i>, as the word <i>Kåsyapa</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.15]].",
    "11017": "This <i>sūtra</i> consists of the single word उञ् meaning उ. According to the same <i>Rishi</i> <i>Sakalya</i>, उञ् is a <i>pragrihya</i>, before इति, in modern Sanskrit. This is also an optional rule. Thus उ इति or विति.",
    "11018": "Before the word इति the word ऊञ् is replaced sometimes by ऊँ the long nasal <i>ū</i>. Thus ऊँ+इति = ऊँ इति or विति.\n\nIn some authorities the <i>sûtras</i> [[1.1.17]] and [[1.1.18]] form but one <i>sūtra</i>, and then it is divided by the method of <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhága</i>, the division of a single <i>sūtra</i> into two separate <i>sûtras</i> having two distinct rules.",
    "11019": "This <i>sūtra</i> finds its scope in the Vedic literature generally. There is a <i>sūtra</i> [[7.1.39]] which declares that \"in the Vedic Sanskrit, the case-affixes <i>sup</i> are often replaced either by सु (I.S.), or are altogether elided, or they are changed into a letter homogeneous with the prior letter, or आ, or आत्, or शे, or या, or डा, or ड्या, or याच्, or आल् takes their place.\" Let us take the example where a case-affix is changed into a letter homogeneous with the prior. Thus the case-affix of the seventh case is ङि (इ). In forming the 7.S. of तनू \"body,\" we have तनू+इ. The इ will be changed into a homogeneous letter with ऊ and we have तनू+ऊ=तनू \"in the body,\" as, अध्यस्यां मामकीतनू (for मामक्यां तन्वाम्). This is the Vedic form, the secular form being तन्वाम्. Similarly गौरी+इ = गौरी \"on the <i>Gauri</i>,\" as सोमो गौरी अधिश्रितः (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> IX.12.3). It is in such cases, therefore, that the long <i>ī</i> and <i>ū</i> are used in the sense of locative, and are <i>pragrihya</i>.\n\nIt is only long <i>ī</i> and <i>ū</i> which are <i>pragrihya</i>, and not any other vowel, though used in the sense of locative. Thus by the same aphorism (VII.I.39) <i>ḍå</i> (<i>â</i>) may be employed to denote the seventh case-affix. Thus अग्नि+ङि = अग्नि+डा = अग्ना \"in the fire,\" as, प्रियः सूर्ये प्रियो अग्ना भवाति य इन्द्राय सुतसोमो ददाशत् (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> V.37.5). Here अग्ना though in the locative case, its final is not <i>pragrihya</i>. Therefore अग्ना+इति = अग्नेति.\n\nThe ई and ऊ must be of the 7th case. Therefore मति+टा (3rd S.) = मति+इ (letter homogeneous with the prior) = मती 'with wisdom'. Here <i>ī</i> is in the sense of the instrumental case and is not <i>pragrihya</i>. Thus मती+इति = मतीति.\n\nThe word अर्य is used in the aphorism, in order to exclude the application of this rule to cases like the following. Thus in forming the compound of वाप्याम् \"in the well\" and अश्व \"horse\", the case-affix is elided, and we get वापी + अश्व. Here, no doubt, the word वापी is in the locative case, though the case-affix is elided; but we cannot say that the long ई of <i>vâpî</i> has the sense of the locative. Here, therefore, we shall have <i>sandhi</i>; as, वाप्यश्वः \"the horse near the well.\" In other words, the present aphorism is not to apply to the final ई or ऊ of words standing as the prior member of a compound term (<i>pûrva</i>-<i>pada</i>); for words like वापी &c., in the above example, can never, by themselves and alone, denote the locative case; while words like गौरी, formed in the way described already, give the sense of the locative, even alone, though they be placed anywhere in a sentence.",
    "11020": "This defines the word <i>ghu</i>. Four verbs have the form of दा, or assume it by the application of [[6.1.45]], and two, of धा; they are called घु. The <i>ghu</i> verbs have certain peculiarities of conjugation to be described hereafter.\n\nThe घु verbs are the following:- डुदाञ् \"to give,\" as प्रणिददाति; दाण् \"to give,\" as, प्रणिदाता; दो \"to cut,\" as, प्रणिद्यति; देङ् \"to pity\" as, प्रणिदयते, डुधाञ् \"to place\" as प्रणिदधाति, धेट् to \"feed\" as, प्रणिधयति.\n\nIn the above examples, because of the verbs being घु, the न of प्रनि is changed into ण by [[8.4.17]].\n\nSimilarly दाप् \"to cut\" and दैप् \"to clean\" not being called घु, rules [[7.4.46]] and [[7.4.47]] do not apply to them. Thus दा+क्त = दातं 'what is cut,' as, दातं बर्हिः. So also अवदातं \"washed\" as, अवदातं मुखं \"a bright face.\" But with दा \"to give,\" &c. दा+क्त = दद्+त [[7.4.46]] = दत्तः \"given;\" so also we have प्र+दा+क्त = प्रत्तम् [[7.4.47]]. The word घु occurs in <i>sûtra</i> [[6.4.66]], &c. The word <i>dåp</i> includes also <i>daip</i> by the <i>paribhâshâ</i> given under [[3.4.19]], ऐ changed into आ by [[6.1.45]].",
    "11021": "This is an <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i> and consists of four words, आदि \"the beginning,\"  अन्त \"end,\" वत् \"like,\" एकस्मिन् \"in one;\" the literal translation being \"beginning is end-like in one.\" The affix वत् has the force of the locative, and the meaning is \"on the beginning,\" and \"on the end,\" i.e., let an operation be performed on a single letter, as upon an initial or upon a final. Thus by [[3.1.3]]. an affix has <i>udatta</i> or acute accent on its initial vowel. Thus the affix <i>tavya</i> has accent on the first अ, and we have कर्त्तव्य॑म्. But when an affix consists of a single vowel, it is itself the beginning and the end, and, as such, will have the accent. As in औपगवम् <i>aupagavam</i> the last <i>a</i> has the accent, which <i>a</i> represents the affix अण्.\n\nSimilarly, by [[7.3.102]], the final of a base ending in short अ is lengthened before a case-affix beginning with a consonant of यञ् class. Thus राम + भ्याम् = रामाभ्याम्. This rule will apply when the word consists of one letter only, and that letter is a short अ. Thus अ + भ्याम् = आभ्याम् \"by those two.\" Here it must not be objected that the solitary अ is initial, and cannot be final.\n\nWhy do we say \"in one\"? If a word consists of more than one letter, then the beginning is not like the end. Thus in the word सभा the initial short अ is not like the final long आ; otherwise सभा would get the name of वृद्धम् [[1.1.73]], and the secondary derivative from सभासन्नयन would be formed by the affix छ् [[4.2.114]]. But this is not so, the affix अण् is employed instead, and the form is साभासन्नयनः.",
    "11022": "This <i>sutra</i> defines घ affixes. They are two, तर and तम, the प् in them being इत्. The special use of these affixes will be described later on. These affixes are useful in forming the comparative and the superlative degrees respectively of adjectives, adverbs, &c. The base undergoes certain changes before these terminations, which will be treated of in its proper place.\n\nThus the words कुमारितरा and कुमारितमा are formed by adding the affixes तर and तम to the word or 'a girl,' whose long ई is shortened before these affixes by <i>sutra</i> 43 of the third chapter of the 6th Book.",
    "11023": "This <i>sutra</i> defines the word <i>sankhya</i>, or numeral.\n\nThese are certain words, besides the ordinary numerals, having some peculiarity of declension. The words like बहु 'many,' and गण 'class', and those that have the affixes वत् and अति after them, belong to this class. The letters उ and ड of वतु and डति are इत्, or indicatory, the actual affixes being वत् and अति.\n\nThe word <i>sankhya</i> means \"numerals;\" and this class contains, among others, the Sanskrit numerals. The words formed by adding वतु are generally compound pronouns, e.g. तावत् \"so much,\" यावत् \"as much,\" एतावत् \"so much,\" similarly words formed by the affix डति, e.g. कति \"how many,\" तति \"so many,\" यति \"as many.\"\n\nThus बहु + कृत्वसुच् [[5.4.17]] = बहुकृत्वः \"many times\" the affix कृत्वसुच् being added only to <i>sankhya</i> words in the sense of the repetition of the action. So also बहु + धा [[5.3.42]] = बहुधा \"in many ways.\" Here also the affix धा is added by virtue of बहु being a <i>sankhya</i>. Similarly बहुकः [[5.1.22]] \"purchased for a big sum,\" बहुशः [[5.4.43]] \"manifold.\" So also गणकृत्वः, गणधा, गणकः, गणशः; so also तावत्कृत्वः, तावद्धा, तावच्छः, कतिकृत्वः; कतिधा, कतिकः, कतिशः.\n\nWhen the words बहु and गण mean \"abundance\" and \"multitude\" they are not <i>sankhya</i>. It is only when they are expressive of numbers, that they get the designation of <i>sankhya</i>. The necessity of defining <i>sankhya</i> arose in order to exclude such words as, भूरि \"numerous,\" &c., which though they express numbers, are not to be treated as \"numerals,\" technically so called.\n\nVart:- The word अर्द्ध \"half\" when standing as a first term in a compound number which takes an affix giving the sense of an ordinal, gets the designation of <i>sankhya</i>, for the purposes of the application of the rules of <i>samasa</i> and of the affix कन्. The ordinal affixes or <i>purana</i> <i>pratyayas</i> are like डट् [[5.2.48]], मट् [[5.2.49]], थक् [[5.2.51]], &c. Thus एकादशः \"eleventh,\" पंचमः \"fifth,\" चतुर्थः \"fourth,\" &c. Similarly we have अर्द्धपंचशूर्पः \"purchased for 41\/2 baskets\" (a <i>dvigu</i>). Here अर्द्ध + पंचमा (an ordinal) = अर्द्धपंचम्, a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound meaning 41\/2, vis., that in which half is the fifth term. अर्द्धपंचमैः शूर्पैः क्रीतः = अर्द्धपंचमशूर्पः the <i>taddhita</i> affixes ठञ् and अञ् required by [[5.1.19]] and [[5.1.26]] being elided by [[5.1.28]].\n\nHere, there is compounding (<i>dvigu</i>) by taking अर्द्धपंचमम् as a <i>sankhya</i>, and then applying <i>sutra</i> (II. I. 51). The <i>samasa</i> here is in the sense of <i>taddhita</i>, and this compounding is only possible by rules [[2.1.50]] and [[2.1.51]], when अर्द्धपंचमम् gets the appellation of <i>sankhya</i>. Having got this name, it forms <i>dvigu</i> compound in the sense of the <i>taddhita</i> affixes अञ् and ठञ् [[5.1.26]]. The word शूर्प takes both these affixes in the sense of \"being bought with.\" Thus शौर्पिकम् and शौर्पम् both mean \"bought with a measure called <i>surpa</i>.\" In the above compound of अर्द्धपंचमशुर्पः the sense is that of the above-named <i>taddhita</i>; but the affixes have been elided by [[5.1.28]] after <i>dvigu</i> compounds. So also we have अर्द्धपंचमकः by applying the affix कन्. For these two purposes, namely <i>samasa</i> and the application of कन्, compounds of <i>ardha</i>, like <i>ardha</i>-<i>panchama</i> are treated as <i>sankhya</i>.",
    "11024": "This <i>sutra</i> defines the term षट् which is a subdivision of the larger group <i>sankhya</i>. Those <i>sankhyas</i> which end in ष् or न् are called षट्. The word <i>sankhya</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, because the word ष्णान्ता is in the feminine gender, showing that it qualifies <i>sankhya</i> which is also feminine.\n\nThe numerals that end in ष or न are six, namely पंचन् 'five,' षष् 'six,' सप्तन्, 'seven,' अष्टन् 'eight,' नवन् 'nine,' दशन् 'ten.'\n\nIt is one of the peculiarities of षट् words that they lose their nominative and accusative plural terminations (VII. I. 22). Thus षट् तिष्टन्ति, पंच गच्छन्ति ॥\n\nThe word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i> shows that the letters ष and न must be <i>aupadesika</i> i.e., must belong to the words as originally enunciated and not added afterwards as affix &c. Thus in शतानि 'hundreds, सहस्राणि 'thousands,' अष्टानाम् 'of eights' the न is not radical, but an augment, and therefore they are not षट् and the nominative and accusative plural terminations are not elided; as शतान् + इ = शतानि &c.",
    "11025": "This <i>sutra</i> enlarges the scope of the definition of षट् by including in it, words formed by डति. By <i>sutra</i> 22, words in डति are already <i>sankhya</i>; by this they are also षट्. Therefore we have कति पठन्ति, 'how many are reading,' कति पश्य 'see how many.' Here कति has lost its plural termination by [[7.1.22]].",
    "11026": "This defines the <i>nishtha</i> affixes, that is to say, the affixes of the past participle. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory. They being कित् are liable to all the rules applicable to कित् affixes, such as rule (1. 1.5). Thus we have, कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्.\n\nThe force of the indicatory उ in <i>ktavatu</i> is, by [[4.1.6]], to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of <i>uk</i> <i>pratyahara</i> (उ, ऋ, लृ), the affix ङीप् (ई) must be added. Thus कृतवान् (masc.), कृतवती (fem.). The word <i>nishtha</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.14]].",
    "11027": "This defines <i>sarvanama</i> or pronominals. To know what are the other words comprised in the phrase 'and the rest' we must refer to <i>Panini</i>'s <i>Ganapatha</i> where a list of all groups referred to in the <i>sutras</i>, is given. Thus we know from it, that the following are <i>sarvanama</i>:--\n\nसर्व 'all,' विश्व 'all,' उभ 'two,' उभय 'both,' words formed by the affix डतर such as कतर 'which of two,' words formed by the affix डतम as कतम 'which of many,' अन्य 'other,' अन्यतर 'either,' इतर 'other,' त्वत् 'other,' त्व 'other,' नेम ' half,' सम 'all,' सिम 'whole,' त्यद् 'he, she, it,' तद् 'he, she, it,' यद् 'who,' एतद् 'this,' इदम् 'it,' अदस् 'that,' एक 'one,' द्वि 'two,' युष्मद् 'you,' अस्मद् 'I,' भवतु 'you,' किम् 'what.' So also पूर्व 'east,' 'prior,' पर 'subsequent,' अवर 'west or posterior,' दक्षिण 'south or right,' उत्तर 'north or inferior, subsequent,' अपर 'other or inferior,' अधर 'west or inferior,' are <i>sarvanamas</i> when they imply a relation in time or place, as shown above, and not when they are names. So also रव when it does not mean a 'kinsman or a treasure,' but means 'own.' So also अन्तर when it means 'outer,' or 'an under or lower garment' is a <i>sarvanama</i>.\n\nThere are certain peculiarities in the declension of <i>sarvanama</i> words. Thus सर्व though ending in अ, is not declined like नर which also ends in अ, the plural of सर्व being सर्वे, that of नर being नराः. Similarly the dative singular नराय, सर्वस्मै; the abl. sing. नरात्, सर्वस्मात्; the loc. sing. नरे, सर्वस्मिन्; the Gen. pl. नराणाम्, सर्वेषाम् &c.\n\nThe compounds (with certain exceptions) ending in these words are also <i>sarvanamas</i>. The word उभ 'both' is always used in the dual number as उभौ, उभाभ्याम्. The object of its being inserted in the list of pronominals, ( whilst its declension does not differ from that of नर), is its taking the augment अकच् [[5.3.71]] which it could not have taken, if it were not a pronominal as उभकौ. Another object gained by its being so called, is the application of [[2.3.27]], by which a pronominal may take the case-affix of the 3rd case or the 6th case in denoting cause.\n\nThere are two त्व in the above list, namely त्वत् and त्व, having the same meaning, and both ending in अ. But the final अ of one is <i>udatta</i>, and of the other <i>anudatta</i>. Some give one त्वत् only and not the other, and say that both have <i>anudatta</i> accent. The word सम is a <i>sarvanama</i>, when it is synonymous with the word सर्व 'all,' and not when it means 'equality.' When it has the latter sense of 'equality,' it is declined like नर i.e. like ordinary words ending in अ, as <i>Panini</i> himself indicates in [[1.3.10]], where he uses the regular genitive plural समानाम्, meaning 'among or of equals.' As a pronominal the genitive plural would have been समेषाम्.\n\nThe above words <i>sarva</i> &c. are not to be treated as pronouns when they are used as appellatives. For example, if सर्व be the name of a person then it will be declined like ordinary nouns, as सर्वाय देहि 'give to <i>Sarva</i> (a person'). Here the dative singular is regularly formed. Similarly when these words are so compounded with others as to lose their original independent character, namely when they are उपसर्जन, they are not treated as <i>sarvanama</i>, but follow the regular declension, as अतिसर्वाय देहि 'give to (him who is) above all.' Here in the compound अतिसर्व 'Above-all' or 'Supreme Being,' the word सर्व loses its independent character and defines and determines the sense of another word. Fuller explanation of the word <i>upasarjana</i> will be given later on in [[1.2.43]]. This term सर्वनाम is an अन्वर्थसंज्ञा that is a term the application of which accords with its meaning.",
    "11028": "This is an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]] which follows. As a general rule (see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]]), in <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds, these words <i>sarva</i> &c. are declined like ordinary nouns. The present <i>sutra</i> declares an option to this, in special cases relating to compounds signifying direction. Thus the <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of direction उत्तरपूर्वा 'north-east' may form its dative case as a pronominal, e.g. उत्तरपूर्वस्यै or it may form its dative like ordinary words ending in आ, i. e. उत्तरपूर्वायै. So दक्षिणपूर्वस्यै or दक्षिणपूर्वायै.\n\nWhy do we say \"when signifying a direction\"? The next <i>sutra</i> will enjoin that in <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds, these words are not treated as pronominals. Therefore, if in the present <i>sutra</i>, we had not used the word दिक्, it would have been impossible to know where there was option and where prohibition. By employing the word \"direction,\" it is thus determined, that in a <i>samasa</i>, relating to direction [[2.2.26]], there is allowed option, while there is prohibition in all other kinds of <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds.\n\nWhy do we say \"in compound\"? So that the option may be in that <i>bahuvrihi</i> which is purely <i>samasa</i>, and in no other <i>bahuvrihi</i>. There is no option allowed in that <i>bahuvrihi</i> where there is a semblance of <i>bahuvrihi</i> but not exact <i>bahuvrihi</i>.\n\nThe quasi-<i>bahuvrihi</i>, or analogical <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds, or to use the Sanskrit phrase, <i>bahuvrihi</i>-<i>vadbhava</i>, is taught in <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.9]]. where words in repetition are treated like <i>bahuvrihi</i>. Thus एकं + एकं = एकैकम् 'one and one, each one.' <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds are possessive compounds, but in the above example, no idea of possession enters. However the compound here is treated like a <i>bahuvrihi</i>, for the purposes of the elision of the case-affix of the first member, and the whole compound gets the designation of <i>pratipadika</i>. In compounds like this, therefore, which are <i>bahuvrihi</i>-<i>vat</i>, but not exactly <i>bahuvrihi</i>, the present rule and the succeeding <i>sutra</i> do not apply. Thus एकैकस्मै देहि 'give to each one,' दक्षिणदक्षिणस्यै देहि ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"in the <i>bahuvrihi</i>\"? So that there may be no option in the <i>dvandva</i> compound. Thus दक्षिणोत्तरपूर्वाणाम् 'of the south, north and east.' The prohibition in the case of <i>dvandva</i> by rule 31 is absolute and invariable.",
    "11029": "As a general rule (see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.72]]), when any definition, rule, operation &c. is made applicable to a particular word, the same would also apply to any other word which ends in that word. Thus the plural of man being 'men' in English, the plural of blackman will be blackmen. So the definition of <i>sarvanama</i> given to <i>sarva</i> &c., separately, will also apply to the words ending in <i>sarva</i> &c.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> introduces thus an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.27]]. In <i>bahuvrihi</i> or possessive compounds, the nature of which compounds will be described later on, the above mentioned words are not pronominals, and must follow the ordinary rule of declension. Thus the compound प्रियविश्व meaning 'beloved of all' is a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of प्रिय 'beloved,' and विश्व 'all,' (which is a <i>sarvanama</i>). The declension of this compound will follow the general rule. Thus, in the dative singular, we have प्रियविश्वाय, though the dative singular of विश्व by itself is विश्वस्मै, like other pronominals. So also प्रियोभयाय \"to him who is beloved of both.\" So also द्व्यन्याय, त्र्यन्याय &c.\n\nSimilarly in <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds, these words not being treated as pronominals, they do not take also the special affix अकच्, but the general affix कन्. As, त्वत्कपितृको, मत्कपितृको [[5.3.70]].\n\nThough the word <i>bahuvrihi</i> was present in this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from the last aphorism, the object of using the word <i>bahuvrihi</i> again in this <i>sutra</i>, is this :-- that the prohibition may apply to those expressions also which are no longer <i>bahuvrihi</i>, but whose original components were once <i>bahuvrihi</i>. Thus the words वस्त्रान्तरा and वसनान्तरा are <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds; but when these two words are further compounded into a <i>dvandva</i> compound, the present rule still applies. As, वस्त्रान्तरावसनान्तराः ॥",
    "11030": "This is another exception to the definition of <i>sarvanama</i>. There is a class of compounds in Sanskrit<i> called </i>tatpurusha<i> compounds, in which the last word governs the preceding one. The word governed may be in any one of the six cases: when it is in the third or instrumental case, the compound is called </i>tritiya<i> </i>tatpurusha<i>. When, therefore, there is such a </i>samasa<i>, the words mentioned in </i>sutra<i> [[1.1.26]] are not to be declined like pronominals. Thus the word मासपूर्व is a compound of मास and पूर्व = मासेनपूर्व meaning 'prior by a month,' where the word </i>masa<i> is in the instrumental case. This compound will be declined like ordinary words, e.g. its dative will be मासपूर्वाय, though the dative of पूर्व, when standing by itself, is पूर्वस्मै; so also संवत्सरपूर्वाय ॥\n\nThe </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> of the present </i>sutra<i> has reference to the special </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> ordained by the particular </i>sutra<i> [[2.1.31]]. namely, \"that which ends with the 3rd case affix, is compounded with the words </i>purva<i>, </i>sadrisa<i>, </i>sama<i>, &c.\" and has not reference to the </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> in general, such as one ordained by [[2.1.32]],\" that which ends with the 3rd case-affix when it denotes the agent or the instrument is compounded diversely with what ends in a </i>krit<i> affix.\" Therefore, in phrases त्वयका कृतं 'done by thee,' मयका कृतं 'done by me,' these words are treated as pronominals, though in the instrumental case followed by a word ending in a </i>krit<i>-affix. In other words, reading this </i>sutra<i> with [[2.1.31]], we find that </i>purva<i> is the only </i>sarvanama<i> which is so compounded, and to which only the present </i>sutra<i> would seem to apply.\n\nThe word समास may appear to have been mentioned redundantly, as it has already been mentioned in the previous </i>sutra<i>, the primary object of the </i>sutra<i> authors being to shorten the rules by the keeping out of every unnecessary word. But here, the word समास has been repeated, to show that even in phrases like मासेन पूर्वाय, though not a compound, but used in construction with an instrumental case, the word पूर्व is not a </i>sarvanama_, that is to say, the prohibition extends even to phrases, which bear the sense of the instrumental compound, though not exhibited in the form of the instrumental compound.",
    "11031": "This <i>sutra</i> mentions another exception. In collective compounds the above words are not <i>sarvanama</i>. <i>Dvandva</i> is a compound in which two words are simply joined together, the compound taking the terminations of the dual or plural according to the number of compounded words, or the terminations of the singular, being treated as a collective term. Thus, the compound वर्णाश्रमेतर means, वर्ण 'the castes,' आश्रम 'the orders' and इतर 'the others'. The word इतर in this compound is not to be treated as a <i>sarvanama</i>, but an ordinary word. Therefore, in the genitive plural we have:-- वर्णाश्रमेतराणाम् and not ०इतरेषाम्. So also पूर्वापराणाम् 'of the priors and the posteriors.'\n\nThe word च 'and' in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that it closes the list of exceptions or prohibitions that began with <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]].",
    "11032": "This is a proviso to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.31]], and declares that before the termination जस् (which is the termination of the nominative plural, as we shall find later on, and which in the pronominals is replaced by शी), the <i>dvandva</i> compounds may be treated either as <i>sarvanamas</i> or as ordinary words. Thus the plural of वर्णाश्रमेतर may be either  वर्णाश्रमेतराः or ०तरे, that is, the word may take either जस् or शी.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> governs the four succeeding <i>sutras</i>. The option allowed in the case of the application of the affix Ist pl. to the <i>dvandva</i> compounds of pronominals, does not extend to the <i>dvandva</i> compounds of pronominal which take the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]]. There the <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.31]] is absolute. Thus, कतरः + कतमकः = कतरकतमकाः in the plural. This affix अक (अकच्) comes before the last vowel, with what follows it, of the pronominals and indeclinables.",
    "11033": "Thus we have प्रथमे or प्रथमाः, चरमे or चरमाः, अल्पे or अल्पाः, अर्द्धे or अर्द्धाः, कतिपये or कतिपयाः, नेमे or नेमाः, द्वितये or द्वितयाः ॥\n\nThe words \"optionally when the affix जस् follow\" are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The governing force of the word \"<i>dvandva</i>\" does not extend to this, and stops at this. By the word तय in the aphorism, is meant words ending in the affix तय. The rest are <i>pratipadikas</i> or crude bases. The word नेम has already been enumerated among the pronominals, therefore, the option in its case, is what is called <i>prapta</i>-<i>vibhasa</i>, the result of which will be that though in the nom. pl. it may be declined like नर, the rest of its declension is like <i>sarva</i>, while in the case of <i>prathama</i> &c. the nom. pl. may be like <i>sarva</i>, but the rest of their declension must be like that of <i>nara</i>. The word <i>ubhaya</i>, has been formed by the addition of the affix तय, and it is already enumerated in the list of pronominals, therefore, by the present <i>sutra</i> its nom. pl. admits of two forms.\n\nThe application of the affix <i>kan</i> or <i>akach</i> must depend upon the nature of these words, if pronominals, then <i>akach</i>, otherwise <i>kan</i>.",
    "11034": "These seven words have already been mentioned in the list of <i>sarvanamas</i>. They are always <i>sarvanamas</i>, when they have the meaning given to them in the list, i. e., when they imply a relation in time and space, but when used in any other sense than the one which has been determined or fixed for them, they are not <i>sarvanamas</i>, nor are they so when they are used as appellatives (संज्ञा). Thus, when the word दक्षिण means 'clever,' it is not a <i>sarvanama</i>, as, दक्षिणा इमे गायकाः 'these clever minstrels,' similarly in उत्तराः कुरवः 'the northern <i>Kurus</i>,' the word उत्तर is not a pronominal, for though it declares a direction, it is a proper noun.\n\nWhen these seven words are <i>sarvanama</i>, they are declined like <i>sarva</i>, except in the nominative plural, when they may be declined either as <i>sarvanamas</i>, or as ordinary nouns. The option allowed in the case of these words is a <i>praptavibhasa</i>.\n\nThat there is a 'specification' (<i>niyama</i>), or tacit implication, of a determinate point (<i>avadhi</i>), with reference to which something is to be described by the word itself, is what we mean when we say \"that a relation in time or place (<i>avastha</i>) is implied.\" For example, if we wish to describe Benares as being southern (<i>dakshina</i>), to do this, we may specify some point, say one of the peaks of the <i>Himalaya</i> with reference to which Benares may be described as a \"place to the southward.\" Again we in the north may thus speak of the people to the south of the <i>Vindhya</i> mountains, as being southern, not with reference to the inhabitants of Ceylon, but with reference (as every one here understands by tacit implication) to us ourselves, who live to the north the <i>Vindhya</i> range. Thus, (पूर्वे or पूर्वाः, अवरे or अवराः, परे or पराः) दक्षिणे or दक्षिणे or दक्षिणाः; उत्तराः; अपरे or अपराः; अधरे or अधराः.",
    "11035": "The word स्व when it does not mean a ज्ञाति 'kinsman' or धन 'property' or 'wealth' is always a <i>sarvanama</i>, in every number and case, as it has been enumerated among the pronominals, except in the nominative plural where it is optionally so. Thus स्वे पुत्त्राः or स्वाः पुत्राः 'one's own sons,' स्वे गावः or स्वा गावः 'one's own cows'.\n\nBut when it means 'kinsmen' or 'articles of property' स्वाः alone is the nom. pl. As, स्वा ज्ञातयो 'these kinsmen' प्रभूताः स्वाः 'much riches'.",
    "11036": "The word अन्तर when it means बहिर्योग, viz., 'outer' is always <i>sarvanama</i>, so also, when it means उपसंव्यान or 'a lower garment.' Thus, अन्तरे गृहाः or अन्तरा गृहाः 'outer houses, the residence of <i>Chandal</i>, and other low castes.' So अन्तरे or अन्तराः शाटकाः \"the inner garments, such as petticoats worn under the upper garments.\" The word अन्तर when used in the above sense is always <i>sarvanama</i>, but in the nominative plural, it is optionally so. But, when it is not used in the above senses, it is never a <i>sarvanama</i>, e. g., ग्रामयोरंतरे वसति 'he lives between the two villages,' where the regular locative is अन्तरे. With this <i>sutra </i> ends the section on <i>sarvanamas</i>, which began with <i>sutra </i> [[1.1.26]].\n\nVart:- The word अन्तर when qualifying the word पुरि 'a city,' is not to be treated as a <i>sarvanama</i>, and is, therefore, declined like ordinary nouns. As, अन्तरायां पुरि वसति 'he lives out of the city.'\n\nVart:- The words formed by the affix तीय such as, द्वितीय and तृतीय, are optionally declined as <i>sarvanama</i> before the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ (ङित्), which are the singular terminations of dative, ablative, genitive and locative, as, द्वितीयस्मै or द्वितीयाय, तृतीयाय or तृतीयस्मै.",
    "11037": "This defines <i>avyaya</i> or indeclinables. The words स्वर् &c. must be found out from the <i>Ganapatha</i>; they are the following:--\n\nस्वर् 'heaven,' अन्तर् 'midst,' प्रातर् 'in the morning,' पुनर् 'again,' सनुतर् 'in concealment,' उच्चैस् 'high, aloft' नीचैस् 'low down,' शनैस् 'slowly,' ऋधक् 'rightly, separately, aside, singly, particularly, truly,' ऋते 'except, without,' युगपत् 'at the same time, at once,' आरात् 'near, far from, directly.' पृथक् 'separately, apart,' ह्यस् 'yesterday,' श्वस् 'to-morrow,' दिवा 'by day,' रात्रौ 'by night or in the night,' सायम् 'at eve,' चिरम् 'long, long since, a long time,' मनाक् 'a little,' ईषत् 'slightly, a little,' शश्वत् 'ever,' जोषम् 'gladly,' तूष्णीम् 'silently,' बहिस् 'outside,' अविस् 'below, without, outside.' समया 'near,' निकषा 'near, hard, close by,' स्वयम् 'of one's self,' वृथा 'in vain,' नक्तम् 'at night, by night,' नञ् 'negative particle, not,' हेतौ 'for this reason, by reason of,' इद्धा 'truly, really' हे ह 'exclamation,' अद्धा 'evidently, truly,' सामि 'half,'  वत बत 'enclitic like, as <i>Brahmanavat</i>, priestly,' सनत् सनात् 'perpetually,' उपधा 'division,' तिरस्  'crookedly, awry, over,' अन्तरा, अन्तरेण 'except, without' ज्योक, योक 'long,' कम् 'expletive particle,' शम् 'ease,' सना 'perpetually,' सहसा 'suddenly, hastily,' विना 'without,' नाना 'variously,' स्वस्ति 'greeting, peace,' स्वधा 'exclamation, oblation to Manes,' अलम् 'enough,' वषट् 'exclamation,' श्रौषट्, वौषट् (interjection) 'oblation of butter,' अन्यत् 'again, moreover, otherwise.' अस्ति 'being present,' उपांशु 'in a low voice, secretly, privately,' क्षमा 'patience, pardon,' विहायसा 'aloft in the air,' दोषा 'at night or in the evening,' मृषा, मिथ्या 'falsely,' मुधा 'in vain,' पुरा 'formerly,' मिथो or मिथस् 'mutually, together,' प्रायस् 'frequently, almost,' मुहुस् 'again, repeatedly' उवाहकम् or उवाहिका 'at the same time,' आर्यहलम् 'violently' अभीक्ष्णम् 'repeatedly,' साकम् or सार्धम् 'with' नमस्, 'reverence,' हिरुक् 'without,' धिक् 'fie!' अथ 'thus,' प्रताम् 'with fatigue,' प्रशान् 'alike,' प्रतान् 'widely,' मा, माङ 'do not.'\n\nSo, also the words formed by the affixes <i>ktva</i> <i>tosun</i>, <i>kasun</i>, by the <i>krit</i> affixes ending in म् or ए, ऐ, ओ or औ, and the <i>avyayibhava</i> compounds, are indeclinables. So, also the words formed by the affixes beginning with तसिल् [[5.3.7]] and ending with पाशप् [[5.3.47]], by the affixes beginning with शस् (V. 4. 4.2) and ending with समासांतः [[5.4.68]], by the affixes कृत्वसुच्, सुच्, आच् and थाल् by the affixes having the sense of the affix च्वि, or by the affixes अम् or आम्, तसि or वति, न or नाञ् are also indeclinables.\n\nThe words called <i>nipata </i> will be given under <i>sutras</i>, [[1.4.56]] to [[1.4.61]]. Thus a word which changes not (न व्येति), remaining alike in the three genders and in all cases, and in all numbers, is what is termed an अव्यय or indeclinables.",
    "11038": "This expands the definition of <i>avyaya</i>. There are three words in the <i>sutra</i> <i>taddhitah</i>, <i>cha</i> and <i>asarva</i>-<i>vibhaktih</i>. <i>Taddhitas</i> or secondary affixes are certain affixes, by which nouns are derived from other nouns, such as, from मनु we have मानवः, <i>sarva</i>-<i>vibhaktis</i> are those words which take all case-terminations, <i>asarva</i>-<i>vibhaktis</i> are those which do not take all <i>vibhaktis</i> but some only. Thus the adverb यतः is declined in the singular ablative only, and does not take the dual and plural terminations.\n\nThose derivative words which do not take all the case-terminations, but only some of them and which are formed by the addition of <i>Taddhita</i> affixes are indeclinables. As ततः 'thence,' तत्र 'there.' Both these words are formed by <i>taddhita</i> affixes from the pronoun तद् 'that,' the one is used in the ablative case only and the other in the locative. So also यतः, यत्र, तदा, यदा, सर्वदा &c.",
    "11039": "All affixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds:-1. Those by which nouns are derived directly from roots: Primary affixes. 2. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns: Secondary affixes. The former are called <i>krit</i>, the latter, <i>taddhita</i>.\n\nWords formed by <i>krit</i> affixes which end in म or ए, ओ, ऐ, or औ (connoted by the <i>pratyahara</i>  एच्) are <i>avyayas</i>. Thus the affix तुम् (technically तुमुन्) and अम् (technically णमुल्, [[3.3.10]]) are affixes which end in म्. The words formed by the addition of these affixes will be indeclinables. Thus दातुम् 'to give,' and स्मारम् 'remembering' are <i>avyayas</i>. So also words like जीवसे 'to live,' पिवध्यै 'to drink,' are also <i>avyayas</i> as they end in ए, &c.\n\nThus, in the following examples, the words within quotation are <i>avyayas</i> 'स्वादुंकारं,' 'संपन्नंकारं,' 'लवणंकारं,' भुङ्क्ते, 'he eats first having made it relishing' [[3.4.26]]. \"वक्षे\" रायः ( वच् + से  [[3.4.9]] = वक्षे ); ता 'वामेषे,' रथनामुर्वीम् गव्युतिमेषां ( इ + से = एषे. <i>Rig</i> _<i>Veda</i>  V. 66. 3). अस्मे शतं शरदो 'जीवसे' धा अस्मे वीराञ्छ्श्वत इंद्र शिप्रिन् (<i>Rig</i> _<i>Veda</i>  III. 36. 10). आपः पृणीत भेषजं वरूथं तन्वे मम । ज्योक् च सूर्य्यं 'दृशे,' (<i>Rig</i> _<i>Veda</i>  I. 25. 21,  दृश् + केन् III. 4. II दृशे).\n\nThe word अन्त is used in this <i>sutra</i> for the same purpose, as it was employed in <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.24]], showing that these terminations must be '<i>aupadesika</i>,' and not derivative. Therefore the following words are not <i>avyayas</i>:-- आधये (d, s.), आधेः (g.s.) चिकीर्षवे । चिकीर्षोः । कुम्भकारेभ्यः । नगरकारेभ्यः ॥",
    "11040": "As कृत्वा 'having done' उदेतोः 'having risen,' विसृपः 'having spread.' Thus in the following examples the words within quotation are indeclinables:-- पुरासूर्य 'स्योदेतो' राधेयः । पुरावत्साना 'मपाकर्त्तोः' । पुराक्रूरस्य 'विसृपोः' विरप्सिन्नु दादाय पृथवीं जीवदानुम् ॥ (<i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i> . I. 28) य ऋते चिदभिश्रिषः पुरा जर्तृभ्यः ' आतृदः' । (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. VIIIa. I. 12).",
    "11041": "The <i>Avyayibhava</i> or adverbial or indeclinable compounds are formed by joining an indeclinable particle with another word. The resulting compound, in which the indeclinable particle forms generally the first element, is again indeclinable, and generally ends, like adverbs, in the ordinary terminations of the nominative or accusative neuter. Thus अधिहरि 'upon <i>Hari</i>,' अनुरूपं 'after the form i.,e., accordingly.'\n\nThe word च in the <i>sutra</i> shows that here ends the definition of <i>avyaya</i>. The <i>avyayas</i>, therefore, are all those words which are comprised in the above five <i>sutras</i>.\n\nWhat is the object gained by making the <i>avyayibhava</i> compounds <i>avyayas</i>? Three objects are gained, by making these compounds, indeclinables, viz., we can apply to them (1) the rule relating to the elision (लुक्) of the case affixes and feminine affixes, i.e., <i>sutra</i> [[2.4.82]] thus, in the following example, the words <i>upagni</i> and <i>pratyagni</i> though qualifying the word <i>salavah</i>, do not take the gender and number of the latter, उपाग्नि प्रत्यग्नि शलाभाः पतन्ति (2) the rule relating to accent when an <i>avyaya</i> is compounded with the word <i>mukha</i>, (मुख स्वर), i.e., <i>sutras</i> [[6.2.167]] & [[6.2.168]]. Thus, उपाग्नि मु॑खः, here, sutra [[6.2.167]], required the final vowel to take the <i>udatta</i> accent, but the preceding word being an <i>avyaya</i>, <i>sutra</i> [[6.2.168]], intervened, and the first word retains its natural accent: (3) the rule relating to the change of <i>visarga</i> : into स्, this change being technically called उपचारः thus उपपयःकारः, उपपयःकामः, as compared with अयस्कारः Here, the compound उपपयः being treated as <i>avyaya</i> <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.46]], applies and prevents the change of: into स्.\n\nThe four <i>sutras</i> [[1.1.38]], [[1.1.39]], [[1.1.40]], and [[1.1.41]] have all been enunciated under the <i>svaradigana</i>. see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.37]]. These <i>sutras</i> properly, therefore, belong to the <i>ganapatha</i>; their repetition here in the <i>Ashtadhyayi</i> indicates that these rules are अनित्य or not of universal application, viz., all rules relating to <i>avyayas</i> in general, do not apply to them. Thus [[2.3.69]]. declaring that the genitive case is not used along with an <i>avyaya</i> is not a rule of universal application, for we see indeclinables like उदेतोः governed by the genitive case as, सूर्यस्योदेतोः; or क्रूरस्य विसृपः.",
    "11042": "This defines the word <i>sarvanamasthana</i>. The affix शि is the nominative and accusative plural termination of neuter nouns. It replaces the ordinary nominative and accusative plural affixes जस् and शस् used in every other gender. The श्र of शि is servile, and the actual termination is इ; the peculiarity of the affix शि is that it lengthens the penultimate vowel [[6.4.8]] and adds a न् [[7.1.72]]. Thus the plural of फल 'fruit' is फलानि 'fruits.' So also कुण्डानि तिष्ठन्ति, and कुण्डानि पश्य. Here, there is no difference of form in the nominative and the accusative cases. So also मधूनि, त्रपूणि, जतूनि. The word <i>sarvanamasthana</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.8]].",
    "11043": "This defines further the word <i>sarvanamasthana</i>. The case-terminations in Sanskrit are 21 as arranged below:-\n\n- Nominative प्रथमा सु (स्) औ जस् (अस्)\n- Accusative द्वितीया अम् औट् शस् (अस्)\n- Instrumental तृतीया टा (आ) भ्याम् भिस्\n- Dative चतुर्थी ङे (ए) भ्याम् भ्यस्\n- Ablative पंचमी ङसि (अस्) भ्याम् भ्यस्\n- Genitive षष्ठी ङस् (अस्) ओस् आम्\n- Locative सप्तमी ङि (इ) ओस् सुप् (सु)\n\nThe above are the 21 <i>vibhaktis</i>, the ज् of जस्, the श् of शस्, the ट् of औट् &c. are indicatory. All these <i>vibhaktis</i> are included in the <i>pratyahara</i> सुप् formed by taking the first <i>vibhakti</i> and the last letter of the last <i>vibhakti</i>. Similarly the first five terminations (सु. औ, जस्, अम् and औट्) are represented by सुट् and are called <i>sarvanamasthana</i> in the masculine and feminine genders. In the declension of nouns, it will be seen, that some nouns have two bases, one before these <i>sarvanamasthana</i> and the other before the rest.\n\nThus the word राजन् 'king' has the base राजान् before the सुट् <i>vibhaktis</i>, while in the remaining cases, the base is राज्ञ् and राज as:-\n\n- Nominative राजा राजानौ राजानः\n- Accusative राजानम् राजानौ राज्ञः\n- Instrumental राज्ञा राजभ्यां राजभिः\n\nBut in the neuter nouns there is no such difference.",
    "11044": "This <i>sutra </i> defines the word विभाषा. We had already had occasion to use this word in <i>sutras</i> [[1.1.28]] and [[1.1.32]]. Where there is a prohibition as well as an alternative course left open, it is called option or <i>vibhasha</i>. The commentators mention three kinds of <i>vibhasha</i>:- <i>prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>., <i>aprapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i> and <i>praptaprapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. The first occurs where there is a general rule already given, and then follows the optional rule; the second belongs to that class where there is no such general rule, but there is an optional rule, the third is intermediate between the two.\n\nThus the root श्वि, 'to swell,' by virtue of the rule  विभाषा श्वे [[5.1.30]], forms its perfect tense, either by <i>samprasarana</i>, or in the ordinary way. Thus the third person singular is either शुशाव or शिश्वाय.",
    "11045": "This defines the word <i>samprasarana</i>. It is the name given to the change of semi-vowels into vowels. The <i>pratyahara</i> <i>ik</i> includes the four simple vowels ई, उ, ऋ and लृ, and their corresponding semi-vowels are य्, व्, र्, and ल् included in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>yan</i>. The word <i>samprasarana</i> is properly the name of the vowel which has replaced the semi-vowel. Thus the past participle of स्वप् 'to sleep,' is formed by adding the <i>nishtha</i> affix क्त (see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.26]]). So that we have स्वप् + त. But there is a rule [[6.1.15]] by which there is samprasarana of the व of स्वप् before the कित् affixes, and we have the form सुप्तः 'slept.' Similarly from वद् - उदितः, यज् - इष्टम्, व्यध् - विद्धः, ग्रह् — गृहीतम् — प्रछ्- पृष्टम्. The term <i>samprasarana</i> is also employed to designate the whole process of the change of the semi-vowels into vowels as in [[6.1.13]]; [[6.4.131]].",
    "11046": "This <i>sutra</i> explains the special use of two of the indicatory letters ट् and क्. Where the indicatory letter of an augment is ट् that augment is to be placed before the word in the genitive case with regard to which it is enjoined; while a कित् augment is to be added after the word exhibited in the 6th case with regard to which it is enjoined. Thus, there is a <i>sutra </i> [[7.2.35]] which says \"<i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes beginning with a consonant except य, have इट्\". The question may arise where is this इट् to be added, in the beginning or the end or the middle of the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix? This <i>sutra </i> answers the question. The indicatory ट् shows, that it is to be placed before the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. Thus the future termination स्यति, is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix: when this is added to the root, it takes the augment इट्. Thus भू + इट् + स्यति = भविष्यति, 'he will be.' Similarly लविता 'he will cut'.\n\nSimilarly by <i>sutra </i> (VII. 3. 40.) the root भी takes the augment षुक् in forming the causative. This having an indicatory क् is to be added after the word भी, as, भी + षुक् + णिच् + त = भीषयते 'he frightens.'",
    "11047": "This <i>sutra </i> explains the use of the indicatory म्. The augments having an indicatory म्, technically called मित् augments, are placed immediately after the final vowel of a word. Thus there is an augment called नुम्, in which उ and म् are इत्, and the actual augment is न्. When, therefore, it is said \"let नुम् be added to the word,\" the letter न् is added after the last vowel. Thus the plural of पयस् 'milk' is formed in the following way :- पयस् + नुम् + इ [[7.1.72]] = पयान्सि [[6.4.8]]. Here न् is added between य and स् i.e. after the अ of य, which is the final vowel of the word: and before this न् at the preceding short vowel is lengthened. Similarly मुच् + श + ति [[3.1.77]] = मुच् + नुम् + श + ति [[6.1.59]] = मुञ्चति । Similarly विरुणद्धि.\n\nThe word अचः is in the genitive case, having the force of <i>nirdharana</i> or specification; it has the force of the plural, though exhibited in the singular, being taken as representing the class. The meaning is 'among the vowels.' This <i>sutra</i> is an exception to <i>sutras</i> [[1.1.49]] and [[3.1.2]], by which an affix is added at the end of the word exhibited in the 6th case.\n\nThere is, however, an exception, in the case of the root मस्ज्, in which the augment नुम् is added not after the last vowel अ of म, but between स् and ज्. The result of adding the augment नुम् between स् and ज् is, that <i>sutra</i> (VIII. 2. 29.) applies, and the स् is elided. Thus मस्ज् + ता = मस्ज् + नुम् + ता [[7.1.60]] = मस्न्ज् + ता = मञ्ज् + ता [[7.2.29]] = मङ्क्ता \"He will immerse\". So also मग्नः 'immersed,' मग्नवान्, मङ्क्तुम्.",
    "11048": "This <i>sutra</i> points out the हृस्व substitutes of एच्. We know there are short and long vowels in Sanskrit, but properly speaking the एच् vowels have no corresponding short vowels. Therefore, when, in any rule, एच् vowels are told to be shortened, this <i>sutra</i> declares that the short vowels of ए and ऐ, ओ and औ, for the purposes of the rule, will be इ and उ respectively. Thus, [[1.2.47]] declares:-- \"the short vowel is the substitute in the neuter of a crude form provided it end in a vowel.\" Therefore in compounding अति + रै, the ऐ must be shortened. Properly speaking ऐ has no short vowel corresponding to it, but by virtue of this <i>sutra</i>, इ supplies the place of such a short vowel, and we have अतिरि 'extravagant' so नौ, अतिनु 'disembarked or landed,' गो, उपगु 'near a cow.' All <i>avyayibhava</i> compounds are neuter [[2.4.18]].\n\nWhy do we say 'of एच्'? Because the short of other vowels will not be इक्. Thus the short of आ is अ. As, अति = खट्वा = अतिखट्वः, अति + माला = अतिमालः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when short is to be substituted?' Because when प्लुत or prolated vowels are to be substituted for एच्, the इक् will not be the substitute. As देवदत्त <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i> ! देवद३त्त !",
    "11049": "This <i>sutra</i> explains the mode of interpreting words used in the possessive case (sixth case) in the <i>sutras</i> of <i>Panini</i>. The genitive case or <i>shashthi</i> denotes many sorts of relations in Sanskrit, such as causation, possession, relation in place, comparison, nearness, proximity, change, collection, component member, &c. So that when a word is in the genitive case in a <i>sutra</i> generally, the doubt may arise in what sense that genitive is to be used. This aphorism lays down the restrictive rule for the interpretation of such words. It says that the force of such genitive is to convey the meaning of 'in the place of.'\n\nThus in the <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.3]], the word इक् is in the genitive case; the literal translation being :- \"of <i>ik</i> there is <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i>.\" But \"of\" here means by virtue of the present rule of interpretation \"in the place of.\" So that the <i>sutra</i> means 'in the place of इक्.' Similarly in the <i>sutra</i> immediately preceding this, viz. [[1.1.48]], we have the word एच् in the genitive case and the <i>sutra</i> means 'of एच्.' Here also \"of\" means \"in the place of.\"\n\nThus in <i>sutra</i> हन्तेर्ज [[6.4.36]] 'of <i>hanti</i>, there is ज्' the word हन्ते, is the genitive of हन्ति; this genitive is used generally and its force is that of \"in the place of.\" Therefore, ज् displaces the verb हन् in लोट् or imperative mood, and we have the जहि 'kill thou.'\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is also thus translated by Dr. Kielhorn :- Only that which is enunciated in a rule, i.e. that which is read in a rule or rather that which in the real language is like that which is read in a rule in a genitive case, or that which forms part of that which is enunciated in a genitive case, assumes the peculiar relation denoted by the word स्थान 'place' i. e, is that in the place of which some thing else is substituted, but some thing suggested by the former does not assume that relation.\n\nThe word स्थान here is synonymous with प्रसङ्ग or 'occasion.' Thus in the sentence दर्भाणां स्थाने शरैः प्रस्तरितव्यम्, the word <i>sthane</i>, means 'prasange' i. e. wherever there is occasion to spread <i>darbha</i> grass, spread there the <i>sara</i> instead. Similarly in <i>sutras</i> अस्तेर्भूः [[2.4.52]], or ब्रुवो वचिः [[2.4.53]], the words '<i>asti</i>,' and '<i>bru</i>' are in the genitive case, and mean, 'wherever there arises occasion to use the verbs अस् or ब्रू use there the verbs भू or वच् instead respectively.' Thus भविता, भवितुम्, भवितव्यम्, are the future, gerund, and passive participle respectively of अस्; so also, वक्ता, वक्तुम् and वक्तव्यम् are the same forms of ब्रू.  \n\nThe word स्थानेयोगा is a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of two words, not in apposition, (<i>vyadhikarana</i> <i>bahuvrihi</i>, see [[2.2.248]] [[2.2.35]]), and it qualifies the word <i>shashthi</i>. The compound means स्थाने योगोऽस्या, 'that which assumes the peculiar relation denoted by the word <i>sthana</i>.' Consequently the seventh case-affix is not elided in this compound; on the analogy of compounds like कण्ठेकालः &c.",
    "11050": "This <i>sutra</i> also lays down another rule of <i>paribhasha</i>. To explain this we must take an example. The <i>guna</i> of इ, उ, ऋ, and लृ, is अ, ए, ओ. There is nothing to specify what letter is the <i>guna</i> of what. It might be said that ओ is the <i>guna</i> of इ because the definitions as laid down up to so far, do not say anywhere that ओ is not the <i>guna</i> of इ. So that when in a word like चि we are told 'let there be the <i>guna</i> of इ' we do not know what specific <i>guna</i> letter is to be substituted, whether it is अ, ए or ओ. To clear up this doubt, this <i>sutra</i> declares that the likest of its significates is to be substituted. Now the nearest in place to इ is ए, both having their place of pronunciation, the palate. Similarly ओ is the <i>guna</i> of उ, because both are labials.\n\nThere are four sorts of proximity or nearness :-(1) nearness in place or स्थान (i.e. palate, throat &c.); (2) nearness in meaning or अर्थ (such as, singular terminations to be used after words used in the sense of singular); (3) nearness in quantity or प्रमाण (such as a short vowel to replace a short vowel, a long vowel, a long one); (4) nearness in quality or गुण (such as aspirates to replace aspirates, and sonants to replace sonants). Of all these approximates the first vis., the nearness in the organ of utterance has preference, in the selection of proper substitute.\n\n(1). Thus in applying rule [[6.1.101]], \"when a homogeneous vowel follows <i>ak</i>, the corresponding long vowel is the substitute for both,\" we must have recourse to the present <i>sutra</i> for finding the proper vowel. Thus - दण्ड + अग्रं = दण्डग्रं; here the substitution of the long आ, for the two short अ's, is an example of substitution by nearness of place, for both अ and आ are gutturals.\n\n(2). A good example of substitution by the sense of the word is afforded by [[6.1.63]]:- \"The words पद्, दत्, नस् &c., are the substitutes when the case-affixes शस् (acc.-pl.) &c., follow.\" Here, we know the substitutes, but we do not know of what they are the substitutes. We apply the maxim of अर्थतः \"that only can become a substitute which has the power to express the meaning of the original, i. e., a substitute takes the place of that the meaning of which it is able to express.\" Thus we find that पद् is the substitute of पाद, दत् of दन्त, नस् of नासिका, &c., which convey the same meaning and contain almost the same letters. Another example of this is afforded by [[6.3.34]], by which feminine words in a compound are changed into masculine. Thus वातण्डी (fem) + युवती = वातण्ड्ययुवतिः.\n\n(3). An example of prosodial substitution (प्रमाणतः) is afforded by rule [[8.2.80]], \"उ is the substitute of what comes after the द् of अदस् not ending in स् and in the room of द् there is म्.\" Thus अम + स्मै = अम् + अस्मै = अमुष्मै; अम + भ्याम् = अमा + भ्याम् [[7.3.102]] = अम् + ऊभ्याम् = अमूभ्याम्. Here, short उ replaces the short अ, and the long ऊ replaces the long आ.\n\n(4). An illustration of qualitative substitution is afforded by [[7.3.52]], \"a letter of the guttural class is substituted for च् and ज् when an affix having an indicatory घ् follows.\" Applying the rule of गुणतः we find that क् which is an <i>alpaprana</i> and <i>aghosha</i> letter replaces च् having the same quality; while ज् which is <i>ghosha</i>, and <i>alpaprana</i> is replaced by the letter ग् possessing similar quality. Thus पच् + घञ् [[3.3.18]] = पाकः; त्यज् + घञ् = त्यागः; रञ्ज् + घञ् = रागः ॥\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>sthana</i> was understood in this <i>sutra</i> from the last, the repetition of this word indicates the existence of the following <i>paribhasha</i> :-\n\nWherever there exist several kinds of proximity between that for which something else shall be substituted, and its possible substitutes, there the proximity as to the organ of speech is weightier than the rest, i. e., there that only is substituted which is nearest as regards the organs of speech with which both are uttered.\n\nThus in finding the <i>guna</i> substitutes of इ and उ out of the three <i>guna</i> letters अ, ए and ओ, we find that अ is a proximate substitute having regard to prosodial measure, i. e., अ and इ and उ have all one <i>matra</i>; while having regard to the proximity of the organ of utterance, we get ए and ओ; the latter however prevails to the exclusion of the first; as चेता, स्तोता.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"likest\" in the superlative degree? Where there are many sort of proximities, the likest must be taken. Thus वाक् + हसति = वाग्घसति. Here, by [[8.4.62]], \"after a letter of झय् class, ह् is changed into a letter homogeneous with the preceding,\" ह् must be changed into a letter of the class क्. Out of the five letters of this class, ख् and ह् are both aspirates, but ख् is hard, and ह् is soft; so ग् an ह् are both soft, but ग् is unaspirate, and is ह् aspirate, therefore these must be rejected; the only letter which has the nearest approach to ह्, is घ्, which is both soft and aspirate. Similarly in त्रिष्टुब्भसति, the ह has been changed into भ.",
    "11051": "This <i>sutra</i> consists of three words viz., उः which is the genitive singular of ॠ and means literally 'of ॠ' or 'in the place of ॠ'; the second word is अण्, a <i>pratyahara</i> denoting अ, इ and उ long and short; the third word is रपरः which qualifies अण् and means 'having a र after.'\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is useful in fixing the proper substitutes of ॠ. Thus, there are only three <i>guna</i> vowels अ, ए and ओ. Of these what is the proper <i>guna</i> for ॠ? By the application of the rule of 'nearness of place' we see that अ is the nearest substitute. So that अ is the <i>guna</i> of ॠ; and further by this rule, this अ must have a र् after it. Thus though technically speaking अ is the <i>guna</i> of ॠ, the actual substitute is अर्. Thus कृ + ता = कर्त्ता; similarly हर्ता.\n\nSo also when ॠ is replaced by इ as by <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.100]], this substitute इ must be followed by a र्. As कॄ + अति = कि + र् + अति = किरति 'he scatters;' similarly गिरति 'he swallows.'\n\nSo also when ॠ is replaced by उ, as by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.115]] this उ must be followed by a र्. As द्वि + मातृ + अण् = द्वैमातुरः 'son of two mothers'\n\nThis र् is to be added only when ॠ is replaced by अ, इ or उ (अण्) vowels, and not when it is replaced by any other letter.\n\nThus by [[4.1.97]], \"the ॠ of the word सुधातृ is replaced by अक् (technically अकङ्) when the affix इञ् is added.\" Thus, सुधातृ + इञ् = सुधात् + अक् + इ = सौधातकिः, 'a descendant of <i>Sudhatri</i>' Here the substitute of ॠ, that is to say, the syllable अक् is not followed by र्.\n\nThe र in the text has been taken by some to be a <i>pratyahara</i> formed by the letter र् and अ of लण्; and thus it includes the letters र् and ल्. In that case the <i>sutra</i> would mean that अण् substitutes of ॠ and लृ are always followed by र् and ल् respectively. Thus <i>guna</i> of <i>ri</i> = <i>ar</i>, of <i>li</i> = <i>al</i>.",
    "11052": "The rule of substitution by nearness of place applies to the last letter of the word which is exhibited in the genitive case and not to all its letters. Thus by <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.102]], it is declared त्यदादीनामः \"in the place of त्यद् &c., there is अ.\" It does not mean that the whole word त्यद्, is replaced by अ; though at first sight it may appear to mean so; but it means, by virtue of the present explanatory <i>sutra</i>, that the last letter of त्यद्, namely द् is to be replaced by अ.\n\nSo also in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.50]] इद्रगोण्याः the short इ replaces only the final letter of गोणी and not the whole word, as पंचगोणिः 'purchased for five <i>gonis</i>.' दशगोणिः",
    "11053": "This <i>sutra</i> is an exception by anticipation to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.55]]. By that all substitutes, consisting of more than one letter, replace the whole word.\n\nThus in forming the <i>dvandva</i> compound of मातृ and पितृ there is a rule [[6.3.25]] by which it is declared:- 'In the place of words ending in ॠ there is the substitution of आनङ् in forming <i>dvandvas</i>.' Now the substitute आनङ् is a ङित् substitute, and therefore it applies to the last letter of the word and not to the whole word, vis, the ॠ of मातृ is only changed into आ and not the whole word; and we have the compound मातापितरौ, so also होतापोतारौ.\n\nThere is an exception, however, in the case of the substitute तातङ् [[7.1.35]] which, though it has an indicatory ङ्, yet replaces the whole expressions तु and हि and not only their finals. As जीवतात् 'may he live, or may you live'; instead of जीवतु 'may he live,' or जीव 'live thou.'",
    "11054": "When any operation is to be made in a word following another, such operation is to be made in the initial letter of such subsequent word. To give an illustration:- there is a rule [[6.3.97]] by which it is declared: \"In the place of अप् used after the words द्वि and अन्तर् and the particles called उपसर्ग there is ई.\" This rule may be stated in other words as:- 'In the place of अप् there is ई when अप् follows द्वि or अन्तर्.' Now it is clear that ई is not to replace all the letters of अप् but only one. By <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.52]] that letter would have been the last letter of अप्, but this <i>sutra</i> makes an exception, namely, where an operation is directed to be made in a word, simply by reason of its being placed after another word; such change is to be made in the beginning of such second word. Therefore, the ई replaces the अ of अप् and we have द्वि + अप् = द्वीपं (the final अ is added by [[5.4.74]]) 'an island,' आन्तरीपं 'promontory.' So also in the <i>sutra</i> ईदासः [[7.2.83]] 'long ई is the substitute of अन when the latter comes after the root आस्.' Thus आस् + अन = आस् + ईन = आसीनः. Here also the ई replaces the initial अ of अन.\n\nHow can we find when an operation is to be performed on a subsequent word? When the previous word is exhibited in the 5th or ablative case, see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.67]].",
    "11055": "This <i>sutra </i> is an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.52]] by which it was declared that an <i>adesa</i> or substitute replaces only the last letter. This <i>sutra</i> on the contrary enjoins that an <i>adesa</i> consisting of more than one letter replaces the whole expression in the genitive case, and not only its last letter. Even where an <i>adesa</i> consists of a single letter, but if it has a श् as its indicatory letter, it replaces the whole word.\n\nThus, there is a <i>sutra</i> ब्रुवो वचिः [[2.4.53]] which means 'in the place of ब्रू let there be वच्. Here the <i>adesa</i> वच् consists of three letters (more than one), and therefore, it replaces the whole word ब्रू and not only the last letter ऊ. That is to say in forming certain tenses the verb ब्रू is replaced by वच्. Thus the future tense of ब्रू is वक्ता 'he will speak.' \n\nSo also there is a <i>sutra</i> (V. 3. 3.) by which it is declared:-- \"In the place of इदम् there is इश्.\" Here the <i>adesa</i> इ is an <i>adesa</i> having the श् for its indicatory letter, and though it consists of only one letter, it replaces the whole word इदम्, and not only its last letter म्.\n\nOf course, it must be understood that the phrase 'consisting of more than one letter' applies to the actual substitute, and not to the substitute with its indicatory letters, the latter being for the purposes of counting regarded as mere surplusages and not to be taken into account. To see whether an affix is अनेकाल् or not, the indicatory letters must not be counted; and the affix must be stripped of all its इत् letters.",
    "11056": "This is an explanatory <i>sutra</i>, or this may be considered also as an <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i>, in as much as it declares that the operations to be performed on or by the original, may be similarly performed on or by the substitute, but with certain restrictions. The words of this <i>sutra</i> require some detailed exposition. <i>Sthani</i> is the word or the portion of a word which is replaced. <i>Adesa</i> is the expression which replaces something. <i>Al</i>-<i>vidhi</i> is a compound of '<i>al</i>' meaning alphabet, or letters in general, and '<i>vidhi</i>' rule i. e. any rule applicable to letters.\n\nThere is an exception, however, to this rule in the case of rules, the occasion for the operation of which, is furnished by the letters of the original term. That is to say for the purposes of orthographic rules, an <i>adesa</i> is not like the <i>sthani</i>. A rule which is applicable to the letters of the <i>sthani</i>, need not be applicable to the letters of the <i>adesa</i>.\n\nThus the gerund of verbs is generally formed by adding the affix क्त्वा e. g. ग्रह् + त्वा. Now (VII. 2. 35.) prescribes the insertion of an intermediate इट् before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes beginning with any consonant except य. This rule is clearly an <i>al</i>-<i>vidhi</i>, because the occasion for its application is conditional on the letters of the affix. The affix त्वा begins with त् and is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix and fulfils all the conditions of the rule. Therefore, we have गृह् + इ + त्वा = गृहीत्वा (VI. I. 16); [[7.2.37]].\n\nNow in compound verbs the affix त्वा is replaced by य (tech. ल्यप्). Thus संगृह् + य. This <i>adesa</i> य which takes the place of त्वा has all the functions of त्वा viz. it has the power of making gerunds; it makes the word an indeclinable (see rule [[1.1.41]] <i>ante</i>), as the affix त्वा does. But the affix त्वा takes an intermediate इ; should, therefore, the <i>adesa</i> य take also the इ or not? Now the augment इ which त्वा takes is by virtue of [[7.2.35]], because it begins with a consonant of वल् <i>pratyahara</i>; while य is the only consonant which is not included in this <i>pratyahara</i>. Therefore, for the purposes of taking इ by rule (VII. 2. 35.) the <i>adesa</i> य is not like त्वा; since that rule is one which has its scope when there are certain initial letters; or an <i>al</i>-<i>vidhi</i>. Therefore, we have संगृह्य.\n\nSubstitutes replace either a धातु 'root,' or an अङ्ग 'base,' or a <i>krit</i> affix 'primary affix,' or a <i>taddhita</i> affix 'secondary affix,' or an <i>avyaya</i> 'indeclinable,' or a सुप् affix 'case affix,' or a तिङ्ग् affix 'conjugational affix,' or lastly the full word or <i>pada</i>.\n\nThe substitute of a <i>dhatu</i> becomes like a <i>dhatu</i>. Thus <i>sutras</i> [[2.4.52]] and [[2.4.53]] declare :- 'भू is the substitute of the root अस्, and वच् of the root ब्रू when an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows.' Here the substitutes भू and वच् are treated as <i>dhatu</i>, and as such get the affixes तव्य &c. by [[3.1.96]], &c. Thus भविता, भवितुम्, भवितव्यम्; वक्ता, वक्तुम्, वक्तव्यम्.\n\nThe substitute of an <i>anga</i> becomes like an <i>anga</i>. Thus [[7.2.103]] declares:- 'क is the substitute of the base किम् when a case-affix follows.' Here, क gets the designation 'base' and so rules applicable to base, are applied to क also. Thus in केन, काभ्याम्, कैः &c., we have इन, the lengthening of the vowel, and ऐस् substituted by (VII. I. 12), and [[7.3.102]], and [[7.1.9]].\n\nThe substitute of a <i>krit</i> affix becomes like a <i>krit</i> affix. Thus (VII. I. 37) declares:- 'ल्यप् is the substitute of the <i>krit</i> affix क्त्वा when the verb is a compound, the first member of which is an indeclinable, but not नञ्' Here, ल्यप् is also called a <i>krit</i> affix, and as such, <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.71]] applies, and तुक् is added. As प्रकृ + ल्यप् = प्रकृ + त् + य = प्रकृत्य; similarly प्रहृत्य &c.\n\nThe substitute of a <i>taddhita</i> affix is like a <i>taddhita</i>. Thus [[7.3.50]] declares :- 'इक् is the substitute of the affix ठ' as दधि + ठक् [[4.2.18]] = दाधिकम्, here, इक् being treated as a <i>taddhita</i>, <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.56]] applies and the word formed by it, gets the name of <i>pratipadika</i>, and is so declined.\n\nThe substitute of an <i>avyaya</i> is like an <i>avyaya</i>. As, प्रस्तुत्यः; प्रहृत्य. The affix क्त्वा makes <i>avyayas</i> [[1.1.40]], its substitute ल्यप् will also make the word an <i>avyaya</i>, and as such <i>sutra</i> [[2.4.82]] applies, and the case-affixes are elided after these words.\n\nThe substitute of <i>sup</i>-affixes becomes like <i>sup</i>. Thus [[7.1.13]] declares:- 'य is the substitute of the <i>sup</i>-affix ङे after an inflective base ending in short अ.' Here, य is treated as a <i>sup</i>-affix, and therefore <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.102]] applies, and there is lengthening of the vowel, as, वृक्षाय; प्लक्षाय.\n\nThe substitute of <i>tin</i> becomes like <i>tin</i>. Thus [[3.4.101]] declares:- 'ताम्, तम्, त and अम् are substituted for तस्, थस्, थ, and मिप् when tense-affixes having indicatory ङ follow.' Here the substitutes ताम् &c., also make the words ending in them <i>pada</i> by rule (1. 4. 14) as, अकुरुतम्, अकुरुत &c.\n\nThe substitute of a <i>pada</i> is like a <i>pada</i>. Thus [[8.1.21]] declares:- 'वस् is the substitute of युष्मान्, युष्मभ्यम्, युष्माकम्, and नस् of अस्मान्, अस्मभ्यम् and अस्माकम्.' Here, वस् and नस् are treated as <i>pada</i>, and the final स् is changed into <i>visarga</i>, as वः, नः.\n\nWhy have we used the word वत् in the <i>sutra</i>? Without it the aphorism would have been a स्थान्यादेशोऽनल्विधौ, and this being a chapter treating of definitions, the meaning would have been, 'an <i>adesa</i> is called <i>sthani</i>.' This certainly is not intended, for had it been so, then all operations would be performed by or on the substitute, but none by the original. But this is not so. Thus rule [[1.3.28]], says 'the root हन् preceded by आ is <i>atmanepadi</i>' वध the substitute of हन् will be <i>atmanepadi</i>, as आवधिष्ट; but हन् also will be so in its proper sphere, as, आहत.\n\nThe word <i>adesa</i> is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate, that the rule applies even to partial substitutions : as changing the इ of ति into उ [[3.4.86]] in the Imperative e.g. पचतु.\n\nThe word <i>al</i>-<i>vidhi</i> is used in order to indicate that the substitutes of दित्, पथिन्, त्यद् &c., such as the change of व् into औ [[7.1.84]], न् into आ [[7.1.85]], द् into अ [[7.2.102]], are not to be treated like the original: as द्यौः, पन्थाः, सः Had these substitutes been treated like the original, rule [[6.1.68]] would apply, and the case-affix सु would have been elided.",
    "11057": "This <i>sutra</i> consists of three words:- अचः genitive of the <i>pratyahara</i> अच् meaning 'of a vowel,' and means an <i>adesa</i> which takes the place of a vowel. The words <i>adesa</i> and <i>sthanivat</i> are understood and are to be supplied from the preceding <i>sutra </i>. The second word is '<i>parasmin</i>' loc. sing. of '<i>para</i>' meaning 'in the subsequent.' The locative has the force of 'on account of or by reason of.' The third word is <i>purva</i>-<i>vidhau</i> loc. sing. of <i>purva</i>-<i>vidhi</i> meaning 'a rule applicable to a preceding thing.' The whole <i>sutra </i> thus comes to mean that an <i>adesa</i> which replaces a vowel, becomes <i>sthanivat</i> (like vowel), provided that the substitution has been occasioned on account of something following and when a rule is to be applied to anything preceding such an <i>adesa</i>.\n\nThus there is an affix called णिच् the actual affix being इ; the other letters ण् and च् being इत्. The peculiarity of every affix having an indicatory ण् is to cause the <i>vriddhi</i> of the penultimate अ; (<i>sutra </i> [[7.2.116]]) as पच + इ = पाचि. Now in forming the denominative verb from the word पटु, we have to add the affix णिच्. Thus पटु + इ ; but before <i>nich</i>, the उ of पटु is substituted by a '<i>lopa</i>' or blank, and this blank takes the place of the vowel उ of पटु and becomes <i>sthanivat</i> by force of the present <i>sutra </i>. The result of becoming <i>sthanivat</i> is that though the अ of पटु is really a penultimate and ought to be <i>vriddhied</i> before '<i>nich</i>' it is not so, the <i>lopa</i>-substitute not allowing the अ to be regarded as penultimate, and thus we have the form पटि the present tense third person singular of which is पटयति. The equation being पट् + ० + इ, the zero preventing the अ of पट् from becoming penultimate. So also in the word अवधीत्, the aorist (लुङ्) of वध. Thus अ + वध + ईत्  = अ + वध् +० + ईत्. Here, the अ of वध is elided by [[6.4.48]]. (when an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows there is elision of the short अ of that which ends in short अ;) this elision is thus caused by something which follows (<i>parasmin</i>.) Now there is a rule (VII. 2. 7.) which declares '<i>vriddhi</i> is optionally the substitute of a <i>laghu</i> अ preceded by a consonant when सिच् (aorist) follows.' However in the present case the zero is considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, and prevents the application of <i>sutra </i> [[7.2.7]]; otherwise we get the form अवाधीत् which is inadmissible.\n\nSimilarly बहुखट्वा + कप् = बहुखट्वकः । Here, the short अ is the substitute of the longआ of खट्वा by [[7.4.15]]; because of the subsequent (<i>parasmin</i>) affix '<i>kap</i>'. However, the word बहुखट्व will not be considered as a word ending in a short vowel, for the purposes of the application of rule [[6.2.174]], (the <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the last vowel but one of a word that ends in a short vowel and is the last member of a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound followed by the affix <i>kap</i>). On the contrary the short अ is regarded as <i>sthanivat</i> to long आ. Thus बहुख॑ट्वकः.\n\nIt is needless to say that this rule applies only to vowel <i>adesa</i>, therefore, where an <i>adesa</i> replaces a consonant, the previous <i>sutra </i> [[1.1.56]] has its scope and prevents its being <i>sthanivat</i>. Thus there is a <i>krit</i> affix called ल्यप्, the real suffix being य, the ल् and प् being diacritical letters. Before this य the verb आगम्(to come) loses it म्, and <i>lopa</i> or blank takes the place of म्. Here then <i>lopa</i> or blank is an <i>adesa</i> and म् a consonant is <i>sthani</i>.\n\nNow there is a rule which says [[6.1.71]], that before <i>krit</i> affixes having an indicatory प्, the letter त is added after verbs ending in light vowels. Now in आगम्, when म् is omitted, the अ of ग becomes final; and therefore a त् is required before य (which is a पित्त् affix). Thus we have आगत्य.\n\nBut had <i>lopa</i> or blank become <i>sthanivat</i> to म् then the अ of ग would have remained penultimate as it was when it was आगम्; and no त् would have been required. But it is not so.\n\nSimilarly in forming the word प्रश्नः. Thus प्रच्छ् + नङ् [[3.3.90]] प्रश् + नङ् [[6.4.19]]. Here, श् is substituted for छ्; this will not be <i>sthanivat</i> to छ्; though this substitute is caused by something that follows (<i>parasmin</i>). Were it to be <i>sthanivat</i>, there would come the augment तुक् (त्) by [[6.1.73]].\n\nSimilarly अक्राष्टाम्, the aorist of कृष्. Thus अ + कृष् + सिच् + ताम् = अ + कृष् + ० + ताम् [[8.2.26]]. Here the स् is elided on account of what follows, but still the <i>lopa</i> substitute here is not <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of [[8.2.41]]. Had it been <i>sthanivat</i>, ष् of कृष् would be changed into क्.\n\nMoreover this rule applies where a vowel is changed on account of something which follows (<i>parasmin</i>). Therefore, where the change has not been occasioned by anything subsequent, the <i>adesa</i> (though of a vowel) is not <i>sthanivat</i>. Thus the words युवजानिः and बधुटीजानिः.\n\nThe word युवजानिः is a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of युवति and जाया, meaning 'he who has a young wife.' In forming this compound, the आ of या is replaced by नि (tech. निङ्) by <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.134]]. This नि will not be <i>sthanivat</i> to आ, as it is not caused by anything which follows. Had it been regarded as <i>sthanivat</i>, the य् could not be elided by [[6.1.66]] ('there is elision of व and य when any consonant except ह् or य् follows'). Thus, युवजाया + नि = युवजाय् + ० + नि [[5.4.134]] = युवजानिः [[6.1.66]].\n\nSimilarly the word वैयाघ्रपद्यः, 'a descendant of व्याघ्रपात्' also illustrates this rule. व्याघ्रपाद् is a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of व्याघ्र and पाद, meaning 'whose foot is like that of a tiger.' Now the final अ of '<i>pada</i>' is elided in such compounds by [[5.4.138]]. This <i>lopa</i> substitution is not caused by anything that follows, therefore, this <i>lopadesa</i> will not be <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of the application of <i>sutra </i> [[6.4.130]] ('पत् is the substitute of the word पात् when part of an inflective base ending in the word पाद् and entitled to the name of <i>Bha</i>. I. 4. 18'). Therefore, व्याघ्रपाद् + यञ् [[4.1.105]] = वैयाघ्रपद्यः. Had the <i>lopa</i> been like the original, there could not have been the substitution of '<i>pad</i>' for '<i>pad</i>.'\n\nSimilarly the word आदीध्ये, Ist per. sing. <i>atm</i>. present tense of the root दीधी 'to shine.' Thus आदीधी + इट् = आदीधी + ए [[3.4.79]]. This change of इ into ए is not caused by anything that follows, hence ए is not <i>sthanivat</i> to इ, for the purposes of the application of rule [[7.4.53]] ('the finals of <i>didhi</i> and <i>vevi</i> are elided when an affix beginning with य or इ follows'). Had ए been <i>sthanivat</i>, the final ई would have been elided.\n\nSimilarly an <i>adesa</i> though of a vowel, and even though occasioned by a subsequent something, would not be <i>sthanivat</i>, if there is not the application of a rule to something that precedes the <i>adesa</i> (<i>purva</i>-<i>vidhi</i>). If the rule is to be applied to something subsequent to the <i>adesa</i>; it will be applied to the exact <i>adesa</i> without considering what was the letter which the <i>adesa</i> had replaced. It is only when a rule is to be applied to a prior object, that it becomes important to consider whether the <i>adesa</i> is <i>sthanivat</i> or not. Thus the vocative case of गो is हे गौः । The vocative is formed from the nominative case [[2.3.49]]. The nominative of गो is formed by changing ओ into औ and adding the case termination स्. Here the <i>adesa</i> औ, replaces ओ, on account of the subsequent termination स्. Now there is a rule applicable to vocative cases which declares that the final स् is dropped after short vowels ए and ओ [[6.1.69]].\n\nNow is the औ of गौ to be regarded as <i>sthanivat</i> to ओ, which it replaces; for the purposes of this rule of elision of finals? If so, the consequence would be that the final स् would have to be dropped in the vocative. But it is not so. Because the rule [[6.1.69]], which ordains the dropping of स् after short vowels and ए and ओ applies to a letter, which is not anterior to the <i>adesa</i> औ, but to one which follows it, and consequently there being no <i>purva</i>-<i>vidhi</i> here, the final स् is retained and we have the vocative गौः ।\n\nSimilarly the word बाभ्रवीयाः, 'the pupils of <i>Babhravya</i>.' The word बाभ्रव्य is derived from बभ्रु in this wise. बभ्रु + यञ् (IV. I. I05) = बाभ्रो + यञ् [[6.4.146]] and [[7.2.117]] = बाभ्रव् + यञ् [[6.1.79]] = बाभ्रव्यः. From this is formed बाभ्रवीय in this wise :- बाभ्रव्य + छ् [[4.2.114]] = बाभ्रव्य + ईय [[7.1.2]] = बाभ्रव्य् + ईय [[6.4.148]] = बाभ्रव् + ईय [[6.4.150]]. Here, had the substitute अव् which replaced the ओ of बाभ्रो, been <i>sthanivat</i> to ओ, rule [[6.4.150]] ('there is elision of the य of a <i>taddhita</i> affix coming after a consonant, when long ई follows'), could not have applied. But this substitute अव् is not <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of rule [[6.4.150]], in as much as that rule does not apply to any letter that precedes the substitute अव्, but to the very letters of the substitute itself.\n\nSimilarly the word नैधेयः, which is evolved from the root धा, in this wise नि + धा + कि [[3.3.92]] = नि + धा + इ (1. 3. 8)= नि + ध् + ० + इ [[6.4.64]] = निधि. Let us then form a secondary derivative from the word निधि applying ढक् [[4.1.122]], the whole of which affix is replaced by एय [[7.1.2]]. Thus निधि + एय = निध् + एय[[6.4.148]] = नैधेय [[7.2.118]]. Here, the <i>lopa</i> substituted for the आ of धा by [[6.4.64]] is not <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of the application of (IV. I. 122) by which the affix ढक् is added. Rule [[5.1.122]] says, '<i>dhak</i> is added to a word ending in इ, provided it be a word containing two vowels.' Now निधि ends in इ and contains two vowels; but if the <i>lopa</i> were <i>sthanivat</i> to the elided आ, then it would be a word of three syllables. That is however not so; because the rule enjoining the affix ढक्  is not applicable to anything preceding the <i>lopadesa</i>, but is enjoined with regard to something after this substitution.",
    "11058": "This <i>sutra</i> lays down an exception to the previous <i>sutra</i>, by which it was ruled that an <i>adesa</i> which replaced a vowel becomes <i>sthanivat</i> under certain conditions. This <i>sutra</i> says that a vowel <i>adesa</i> is not <i>sthanivat</i> under the following circumtances.\n\n1. पदान्तविधिः-- 'A rule relating to the last letter of a word.' Thus the अ of अस् is elided before the terminations of dual and plural numbers (VI. 4. III). Thus we have अस्ति 'he is,' स्तः 'they two are,' सन्ति 'they are.' Now in the technical phraseology of Sanskrit grammarians, the अ of स्तः and सन्ति is replaced by an <i>adesa</i> called लोप्, the peculiarity of which is that the whole of it vanishes. So that before the word स्तः there is this <i>adesa</i> existing, though it is in an invisible form. This invisible <i>adesa</i> will be <i>sthanivat</i>, as it replaces a vowel, by reason of something that follows, i. e. the affixes तः and अन्ति being ङित् [[1.2.4]]; and it will have all the powers of अ by the last <i>sutra</i>, in the absence of any rule to the contrary. Therefore, in the sentence कौ स्तः 'who two are' the final औ of कौ and the invisible अ of स्तः ought to coalesce by rules of <i>sandhi</i> into आव [[6.1.78]]. But this incongruity is prevented by the present <i>sutra</i>, by which the change of औ into आव् is a पदान्त विधि or a rule relating to the finals of a word, therefore, we have कौ स्तः । So also in तानि सन्ति, rule [[6.1.77]] is not applied.\n\n2. द्विर्वचनविधिः 'a rule relating to the doubling of letters.' In the <i>sandhi</i> of दधि + अत्र we have दध्यत्र. Here इ is changed into य्. If this य् were <i>sthanivat</i> to इ, then the rule by which ध् could be doubled before य् would be inapplicable. But य् is not equivalent to इ, though its substitute; and we have the doubling of ध् and get the form दद्ध्यत्र. Therefore, in rules relating to the doubling of letters the <i>adesa</i> is not equivalent to the <i>sthani</i>.\n\n3. वरेविधिः 'a rule relating to the affix वरच्.' The affix वरच् is a <i>krit</i> affix which is added to certain roots to form nouns of agency; thus from ईश् 'to rule' we have ईश्वरः 'ruler.' So from the intensive verb यायाय we have यायावरः 'a vagrant.' It is formed in this wise यायाय + वर [[3.2.176]] = यायाय् + ० + वर [[6.4.48]]. Here the अ of य has been dropped and replaced by <i>lopa</i>, on account of its being followed by the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix वरच्. The next step is to drop the य् by rule [[6.1.66]] which declares that the letters व् and य् are dropped before affixes beginning with any consonant except i. e., beginning with consonants of वल् <i>pratyahara</i>. Thus याया + ० + वर. Now there is a rule [[6.4.64]] which declares that the final long आ of a base is dropped before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes having an initial vowel. Here therefore, if the <i>adesa</i> '<i>lopa</i>,' which replaced the vowel अ, be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, and be considered as an affix having a latent initial vowel, then the आ of याया requires to be dropped. But this <i>sutra</i> prevents this and we have the form यायावर; as, अप्सु यायावरः प्रवपेत पिण्डान् ॥\n\n4. यलोपविधिः 'a rule relating to the dropping of <i>ya</i>.' Thus there is a verb कण्डूय 'to scratch'. In forming an abstract noun from it, the affix ति (tech. क्तिच्) is added. Thus कण्डूय + ति = कण्डूय् + ० + ति, the अ of य being dropped by [[6.4.48]]. Now there is a rule [[6.1.66]] already mentioned above which requires the elision of य् before consonantal affixes. Now if the <i>lopa</i> substitute be considered as <i>sthanivat</i> to अ, then the affix ति is not an affix having an initial consonant and the rule, which requires the dropping of य्, would not apply. The present <i>sutra</i>, however, provides for this, and we have the form कण्डूतिः 'scratching.'\n\n5. स्वरविधिः 'a rule relating to accent.' There is a <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.193]] which says that when a word is formed by an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the vowel that immediately precedes such an affix has the <i>udatta</i> accent. Now ण्वुल् is an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the real affix bein अक (VII. I. I.). It is an affix used in forming nouns of agency. Adding this affix to the desiderative verb चिकीर्ष 'desirous of doing' we have:-- चिकीर्ष + अक = चिकीर्ष् + ० + अक, the अ being dropped by [[6.4.48]]. Now if the zero be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, then the accent must fall on this latent अ but it is not so. The accent falls on the ई of की; and we have चि॒॒कीर्ष॑कः, so also जि॒॒हीर्ष॑कः ॥\n\n6. सवर्णविधिः 'a rule relating to the substitution of homogeneous letters.' To explain this, let us form the second person singular of the verb शिष् in the imperative mood. The affix हि is the sign of the second person imperative singular; and the verb शिष् belongs to the seventh-class of verbs called <i>Rudhadi</i>. This class of verbs take the <i>vikarana</i> श्नम् [[3.1.78]] the श् and म् being indicatory the real affix is न. This न is inserted between the radical vowel and the final consonant [[1.1.47]]. Therefore we have the following equation:- शिष् + श्नम् + हि = शि + न + ष् + हि = शि + न् + ० + ष् + हि. The अ of न is dropped by (VI. 4. III), which declares that the अ of श्नम् is dropped before those <i>sarvadhatuka</i> terminations which are कित् or ङित्. By [[1.2.4]] all <i>sarvadhatuka</i> terminations which have not got an indicatory प् are considered as ङित्. The affix हि therefore is a ङित् <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix, and by rule [[3.4.87]], हि is to be regarded as अपित्, not having an indicatory प्. The next stage is :-- शि + न् + ० + ष् + धि; the हि being changed into धि by rule [[6.4.101]] which says that 'हि is changed into धि, when it follows a root which ends in a consonant of झल् <i>pratyahara</i>:' here ष् and ध् are changed by general rules of <i>sandhi</i> into ड् and ढ् and we have शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि [[8.4.41]]. Then there is a rule [[8.3.24]], which says that in the body of a word the 'न् is changed into <i>anusvara</i> when followed by a consonant of झल् <i>pratyahara</i>.' Therefore we have :-- शि + ० + ० + ड् + ढि. This is the form to which the present rule is applicable. Thus, there is a rule [[8.4.58]] which says that an <i>anusvara</i> followed by a letter of यय् <i>pratyahara</i> i.e., any consonant except ह्, श् ष् and स् is changed into a letter homogeneous or <i>savarna</i> to the letter that follows. Therefore, if we regard zero as <i>sthanivat</i> to the अ which it replaces, the <i>anusvara</i> cannot be changed into ण् as homogeneous to ङ्. But it is not to be so regarded, and we have the form शि + ण् + ड् + ढि = शिण्ड्ढि or शिण्ढि; so also पिण्ढि.\n\n7. अनुस्वारविधिः 'a rule relating to <i>anusvara</i>.' The above example will serve the purpose here:-- शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि. This by the rule already mentioned [[8.3.24]], requires the न् to be changed into <i>anusvara</i>. Now if zero be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, then न् is not followed by a letter of झल् <i>pratyahara</i> , and cannot be changed into <i>anusvara</i>. However, the zero is not regarded as <i>sthanivat</i>, and we change the न् into <i>anusvara</i>. Other examples are शि + न् + ० + ष् + अन्ति = शिंषन्ति; so also पिंषन्ति ॥  \n\n8. दीर्घविधिः 'a rule directing the substitution of long vowels for short vowels.' Let us form the Inst. sing. of the noun प्रतिदिवन्. The termination of the Inst. sing. is टा or आ. Therefore, we have प्रतिदिवन् + आ = प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ. Here the अ has been elided by rule [[6.4.134]], which teaches that words ending in अन् lose their अ before terminations technically called <i>Bha</i>. The termination of Inst. sing. is a <i>Bha</i> termination by force of rule [[1.4.18]]. The next rule that now comes into operation, is [[8.2.77]], which requires the lengthening of the short penultimate vowels, of the इक् <i>pratyahara</i>, of words that end in र् or व् and are followed by a consonant. Here दिव् is a root that ends in व्; and if the zero be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, then this व् is not followed by a consonant, but by a latent vowel, and so the short इ of दिव् will not be lengthened. This rule, however, provides for such lengthening, and therefore we have :- प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ = प्रतिदीव्ना ॥\n\n9. जश्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of soft unaspirate consonants, of <i>pratyahara</i> जश्, in the place of hard consonants' In this case also the <i>adesa</i> that takes the place of a vowel is not <i>sthanivat</i>.\n\nLet us add the affix क्तिन् to the root अद् 'to eat,' compounded with the word स or समान. In Vedic literature अद् is replaced by घस्, [[2.4.39]]; so we have, स + घस् + क्तिन् = स + घस् + ति = स + घ् + ० + स् + ति [[6.4.100]] = स + घ् + ० + ० + ति [[8.2.26]] = स + घ् + ० + ० + धि [[8.2.40]].\n\nIt is at this stage, that rule [[8.4.53]] requires the घ् to be changed into ग्. This is a जश् rule, and teaches that in the place of letters of झल् class, the letters of जश् class are substituted, if followed by letters of झश् class. If the zero which was obtained by dropping the अ of घ, be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, then the घ् is not followed by a consonant of झश् class, and cannot be changed into ग्. But it is not so. Therefore सघ् + ० + ० + धि = सग्धिः (<i>Yaj</i>. <i>Ved</i>. XVIII. 9). The various rules, by which first अ is omitted, and then स् is dropped, have been referred to in brackets, and will be explained in their proper places.\n\nSimilarly the word बब्धाम्, which is the Imperative (<i>lot</i>) 2nd per. dual of the root भस्, and is thus evolved. This root belongs to the <i>Juhutyadi</i> class, and therefore, there is reduplication. Thus भस् + ताम् = भस् + भस् + ताम् = भ + भस् + ताम् = ब + भस् + ताम् = ब + भ् + ० + स् + ताम् [[6.4.100]] = ब + भ्+ ० + ० + ताम् [[8.2.26]] = ब + भ् + ० + ० + धाम् [[8.2.40]] = ब + ब् + ० + ० + धाम् = बब्धाम् ॥ Here the change of भ् into ब् is by the application of [[8.4.53]], which is a <i>jas</i> rule, and therefore, the zero is not <i>sthanivat</i>.\n\n10. चर्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of the letters of चर् <i>pratyahara</i> instead of other consonants.' In the application of this rule, also the substitute that replaces a vowel is not <i>sthanivat</i>.\n\nLet us form the 2nd pers. sing. perfect of the verb अद् 'to eat.' अद् is replaced by घस् [[2.4.40]] and अतुस् is the termination of the second person singular of <i>lit</i> or perfect tense.  घस् + अतुस् = घस् + घस् + अतुस् [[6.1.8]] = घ + घस् + अतुस् [[7.4.60]] = ज + घस् + अतुस् [[8.4.54]] = ज + घ् + ० + स् + अतुस् [[6.4.98]] = जघ् + ० + सतुस्.\n\nAt this stage comes the चर् rule in operation, which says that the letters of झल्  <i>pratyahara</i> are replaced by those of चर् <i>pratyahara</i>, when followed by letters of खर् <i>pratyahara</i>. Here घ् is a letter of झल् class, and if zero is not <i>sthanivat</i>, it is followed by स् which is a letter of खर् class, and therefore घ् is required to be changed into क् of चर् class. By the present rule, zero is not <i>sthanivat</i> and thus we have :- जक् + सतुस् = जक्षतुः [[8.3.60]].\n\nSimilarly अक्षन् the 3rd per. plural aorist of घस् is thus formed:- अ + घस् + च्लि + अन् = अ + घस् + अन् [[2.4.80]] = अ + घ् + ० + स् + अन् [[6.4.98]]. Here had the <i>lopa</i> been <i>sthanivat</i>, rule [[8.4.55]] could not have applied. But it being a <i>char</i> rule, the <i>lopa</i> is not <i>sthanivat</i>. Therefore we have, अक्षन्.\n\nWhen <i>lopa</i> is the substitute of a vowel, it is not <i>sthanivat</i>, for the purposes of the application of the rules of accent, rules relating to the doubling of letters, and the rules relating to the elision of <i>ya</i>. In other places, with the exception of the above three; the <i>lopa</i> substitute of a vowel is, and must be treated as <i>sthanivat</i>. Thus बहुखट्वकः, किर्योः, गिर्योः, वाय्वोः. In these cases the <i>lopa</i>-<i>adesa</i> being <i>sthanivat</i>, the rules relating to accent, lengthening and the elision of <i>ya</i>, do not apply.",
    "11059": "This <i>sutra</i> has been explained in different ways by the authors of the <i>Kasika</i> and of the <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>. According to the latter, the <i>sutra</i> means:-- 'when an affix beginning with a vowel follows, that is a cause of reduplication, a substitute shall not take the place of a preceding vowel, whilst the reduplication is yet to be made : but the reduplication having been made, the substitution may then take place.' The explanation given by <i>Kasika</i> is more in harmony with the Great Commentary. For all practical purposes, the two explanations lead to the same conclusion. According to <i>Kasika</i>, the vowel-substitute is <i>sthanivat</i>, in the sense, that it is exactly of the same form as the original, and retains this form only for a fixed time viz., so long as the reduplication is being made; but as soon as the reduplication has been made, the substitute takes its proper form. This rule has its scope in the rules relating (a) to the elision of long आ, (b) to the elision of the penultimate, (c) to the elision of the affix णिच्, (d) to the substitution of semi-vowels for vowels, and lastly (e) to the substitution of अय्, अव्, आय् and आव् for ए, ओ ऐ and औ respectively by the rules of <i>sandhi</i>.\n\n(a). Elision of आ. Let us form the 2nd person perfect tense of the root पा 'to drink.' The termination of 2nd person perfect is अतुस्. This is, therefore, a termination beginning with a vowel, and it causes the reduplication of the root. The conditions of the present <i>sutra</i> all exist in this. Thus we have पा + अतुस् = प् + ० + अतुस् [[6.4.64]]. Here the आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64.) which teaches that 'the आ of the root is elided before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes beginning with a vowel and which are कित् or ङित् and before इट्.' The affix अतुस् is such an affix [[1.2.5]], [[3.4.115]].\n\nNow comes the rule about reduplication which is contained in <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.8]], and teaches that a root consisting of a single vowel is reduplicated before the terminations of the perfect. Here, by the elision of आ, the only visible root left to us is प् which is a consonant without any vowel. The rule of reduplication, therefore, would not have applied to it, because there is no vowel in it, but for the present <i>sutra</i>, which solves the difficulty. Here the vowel-substitute zero must be considered <i>sthanivat</i> i. e. as if it were the very आ itself. Thus we have पा + प् + ० + अतुस् = पपतुस् [[7.4.59]]. The long आ of the reduplicative syllable has been shortened by [[7.4.59]]. So also पपुः ।\n\n(b). The elision of the penultimate. Let us form the same tense of हन् 'to kill.' हन् + अतुस् = ह् + ० + न् + अतुस् [[6.4.98]].\n\nHere also the preliminary conditions are all fulfilled, the affix begins with a vowel and it causes the reduplication of the root. The penultimate अ of हन् is replaced by the substitute <i>lopa</i> by [[6.4.98]], which teaches that the roots गम् 'to go' हन् 'to kill' and a few others lose their penultimate before affixes beginning with a vowel and which are also कित् or ङित्. We know अतुस् to be such an affix. For the reasons already given, we can not reduplicate the consonants हन् as they have no vowel. However, this reduplication is effected by virtue of the present rule, and we have:- ह + हृ + अतुस् = जघ्नतुः [[7.4.62]], [[7.3.55]]. The first ह् is changed into ज् by [[7.4.62]] and the second ह् into घ् by [[7.3.55]].\n\nThe elision of the affix णिच् . Let us form the Aorist (<i>lun</i>) of the causative form of अट्. The causative is formed by adding the affix णिच् to the root; and the aorist takes the augment अ. Thus we have :- अ + अट् + णिच् + त् = आट् + इ + त्= आट् + इ + चङ् + त्. The affix चङ् [[3.1.48]] is added in forming the aorist of causatives. The letters च् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix being अ. Now by [[6.4.51]], the affix णिच् is elided before an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix that does not take the intermediate इ. Now चङ् is such an affix. Therefore we have आट् + ० + अत् .\n\nAt this stage, comes into operation another rule [[6.1.11]], which declares that 'the root is reduplicated before the affix चङ्.' The चङ् is, thus, an affix which causes reduplication; it is an affix which also begins with a vowel. Therefore, it satisfies the conditions of this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore, the zero which was a substitute in place of the vowel इ, becomes <i>sthanivat</i> to इ; as if it were the very इ itself. Thus we have the reduplicative syllable टि, by rule [[6.1.2]], which says that a verb beginning with a vowel reduplicates its second syllable. But as soon as the reduplication is over, the <i>adesa</i> takes up its original form of zero. Thus आटिट् + ० + अत् = आटिटत्.\n\n(d). The fourth class of cases, where this <i>sutra</i> has scope, is the substitution of यण् for vowels. Thus let us form the perfect and 2nd person singular of कृ 'to do' :- कृ + अतुस् = क्र् + अतुस्, the semi-vowel र् taking the place of ॠ by the general rule of <i>sandhi</i> [[6.1.77]]. Now we have already learned that अतुस् is an affix which causes reduplication and it begins with a vowel. Now र् is a substitute which comes in the place of a vowel (i.e., ॠ), it will therefore be <i>sthanivat</i> by this <i>sutra</i>. Had it not been <i>sthanivat</i>, the consonants क्र् could not be reduplicated, as they have no vowel. The substitute र् being taken equal to ॠ, we reduplicate कृ; in reduplication the क is changed into च् by [[7.4.62]], and ॠ into अ by [[7.4.66]]. Thus we have:- चक्रतुः; similarly चक्रुः ।\n\n(e). The fifth case is the substitution of अय् &c. Let us form Ist person singular of the perfect of नी 'to lead:' नी + णल् = नै + अ = नाय् + अ. The ई is <i>vriddhied</i> before the termination अ of the perfect [[7.2.115]], and then changed into आय् by the general rule of <i>sandhi</i> [[6.1.78]]. Now the अ of the perfect causes reduplication, and it is an affix which begins with a vowel. It satisfies the conditions of this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore the आय् which was a substitute for ऐ, being a vowel substitute, becomes <i>sthanivat</i> to ऐ in form. In reduplicating the word नाय्, we reduplicate as if it were still नै. Thus we have the form निनाय and not ननाय. Similarly निनय, लुलव, and लुलाव.\n\nWhy have we used the word \"<i>dvirvachane</i>\" in the <i>sutra</i>? Without it, the aphorism would have stood thus:-\"Before an affix having an initial vowel which causes reduplication, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel is like the original vowel.\" Let us form जग्ले the 3rd per. sing, perfect tense (लिट्) of the root ग्लै \"to be exhausted,\" in the <i>atmanepada</i>. The affix of 3rd per. sing. <i>atm</i>. of <i>lit</i>, is एश् [[3.4.81]]. Thus ग्लै + एश् = ग्ला + एश् [[6.1.45]]. Now here ऐ is changed into आ, on account of the affix एश्; this affix causes reduplication, but still आ is not to be considered as <i>sthanivat</i> to ऐ. For if आ be considered so, then in the next stage ग्ला + एश् = ग्ला + ० + एश् [[6.4.64]] the <i>lopa</i> will be regarded as <i>sthanivat</i> to ऐ and the reduplicative syllable will be जि and not ज; the form being जिग्ले and not जग्ले. But  आ is not <i>sthanivat</i> to ऐ, because for the purposes of reduplication, the change of ऐ into आ is immaterial; it is the second and further change of आ into zero which is directly connected with reduplication, (for if zero be not considered <i>sthanivat</i>, there can be no reduplication); and therefore, this substitute zero should be regarded as <i>sthanivat</i> to आ.\n\nWhy do we say \"which causes reduplication?\" Without these words the <i>sutra</i> would have stood thus:- \"Before an affix having an initial vowel, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel is like the original vowel, for the purposes of reduplication.\" In that case we could not get the form दुद्यूषति, 3rd per. sing, desiderative present tense of दिव् 'to shine, to play.' This form is thus evolved :- दिव् + सन् [[3.1.7]] = दि + ऊ + सन् [[6.4.19]] = द्य् + ऊ + सन् [[6.1.77]]. Here, the change of इ into य् is caused by ऊ (tech. ऊठ्), which begins with a vowel; is this य् to be regarded as <i>sthanivat</i> to इ? No, because ऊ does not cause reduplication, it is सन् which causes reduplication. Therefore the equation is :- द्यू + सन् = दुद्यूस [[6.1.9]] = दुद्यूषति. If य् could be regarded like इ, then the form would have been दिद्यूषति.\n\nWhy do we say \"beginning with a vowel\"? Otherwise the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus:- \"Before an affix which causes reduplication, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel, is like the original vowel, for the purposes of reduplication.\" The affix यङ् of the Intensive verbs causes reduplication [[6.1.9]]; but as it does not begin with a vowel, the substitute will not be <i>sthanivat</i>. Let us form जेघीयते the 3rd per. sing. Intensive of the root घ्रा 'to smell.' Thus घ्रा + यङ् = घ्री + यङ् [[7.4.31]] = जेघ्रीयते [[7.4.82]]. Here, आ is changed into ई on account of यङ्; but ई is not <i>sthanivat</i> to आ; had it been so, the form would have been जघ्रीयते. Similarly देध्मीयते.",
    "11060": "This defines elision. When a letter or word-form becomes latent, is neither heard, nor pronounced, nor written, it becomes <i>lopa</i> or is said to be elided. <i>Lopa</i> is the term for the disappearance of anything previously apparent.\nIn Sanskrit Grammar, this \"<i>lopa</i>\" is considered as a substitute or <i>adesa</i>, and as such this grammatical zero has all the rights and liabilities of the thing which it replaces. This blank or <i>lopa</i> is in several places treated as having a real existence and rules are made applicable to it, in the same way as to any ordinary substitute that has an apparent form. The Grammarians do not content themselves with one sort of blank, but have invented several others; there are many kinds of them, such as <i>lopa</i> blank, <i>slu</i> blank, <i>lup</i> blank, and <i>luk</i> blank, which like different sorts of zeroes of a Mathematician, have different functions.\n\nThe word <i>lopa</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[6.1.66]] and [[6.4.118]] &c. The <i>lopa</i> substitute is a sense substitute, and not a form substitute. Thus when we say 'let the substitute <i>lopa</i> take the place of such and such a letter or word,' we do not mean that the letters ल्, ओ, प् and अ should be substituted there, but the sense of the thing, namely 'disappearance.'",
    "11061": "When an affix is elided by using the term <i>luk</i>, that disappearance gets the appellation of <i>luk</i>, similarly when an affix is elided by using the terms <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>, the disappearance gets the name of <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>.\n\nThus in अद् + शप्लुक् + ति = अत्ति 'he eats.' Here the <i>vikarana</i> शप् has been elided by using the word <i>luk</i> [[2.4.72]]. Similarly in जुहोति 'he invokes,' the <i>vikarana</i> शप् is elided by the word <i>slu</i> [[2.4.75]], so in वरणाः 'a city in the vicinity of weeds called <i>varana</i>.' Here the <i>Taddhita</i> affix indicating vicinity has been elided by the word <i>lup</i>. [[4.2.82]].\n\nWhy do we use the words \"of the affix\"? Without these words, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus:- \"The disappearance is called <i>luk</i>, <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>.\" So that the disappearance of a base would also be caused by the use of these terms. Thus in [[2.4.70]], there would have been '<i>luk</i>' of the bases <i>agastya</i>, and <i>kaundinya</i>; which however is not intended. In that <i>sutra</i>, the '<i>luk</i>' of the affixes is only intended. So also in <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.168]] there would have been the substitution of '<i>luk</i>' for the bases of the words.",
    "11062": "This <i>sutra</i> declares that when an affix disappears by <i>lopa</i>-elision its potency does not disappear. Thus the term '<i>pada</i>' is defined to be that which ends in a case-affix or a conjugational-affix. But after certain bases, these affixes vanish; still those bases become '<i>pada</i>' in spite of the vanishing of the whole affix. How can an operation directed by an affix take place, when the affix itself vanishes, is a doubt which may naturally arise. This <i>sutra</i> answers the question. Though an affix may be elided by <i>lopa</i>, yet an operation of which such an affix was the cause, must take place. Thus अग्निचित् is a <i>pada</i> though the case-termination has been elided. Similarly the word अधोक् 'he milked;' which is the Imperfect (लङ्) of दुह्, and is thus formed. अदोह् + तिप् = अदोह् + त् [[3.4.100]] = अदोह् + ० [[6.1.68]] = अदोघ् + ० [[8.2.32]] (here ह् is changed into घ् by taking the word '<i>aduh</i>' as a '<i>pada</i>') अधोघ् + ० [[8.2.37]] = अधोग् [[8.2.39]] = अधोक्.\n\nWhy have we used the word प्रत्यय in this aphorism again, when its <i>anuvritti</i> was understood in this <i>sutra </i> from the last ? This repetition indicates that the present rule applies where the whole of the affix is elided, and not when a portion of an affix is elided. The present <i>sutra</i>, therefore, does not apply to forms like आघ्नीय and सङ्ग्मीय. These forms are the 1st person sing. लिङ् <i>Atmanepada</i> of हन् and गम्. Thus आहन् + इट् = आहन् + अ [[3.4.106]] = आहन् + सीयुट् + अ [[3.4.102]] = आहन् + ईय् + अ. Here, स् a portion of the affix सीयुट् is elided by [[7.2.79]]; now there will be no प्रत्ययलक्षण of this partial elision of an affix. Had it been so, the final nasal न् of आहन् would have been elided by [[6.4.37]]: but that is not so: and we have आघ्नीय [[7.3.54]] and [[6.4.98]].\n\nThe word लक्षण means that by which a thing is recognised. The word प्रत्ययलक्षण, therefore, means the effect by which an affix could be recognised. The orthographical changes, like the following, are not however <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i>. In forming the genitive singular of रै 'wealth,' we have  रै + अस् = रायः, here, the change of ऐ into आय् by the rules of <i>sandhi</i>, though caused by the affix अस्; is not such an effect, which the affix causes, by virtue of being an affix, but it is an effect caused by the accidental fact, that the affix begins with a vowel, and thus gives scope to the euphonic rule [[6.1.78]]. Therefore, when in forming the genitive compound of रायः + कुलं, we elide the case-affix अस्, we get the form रैकुलम्. Here the elided affix will not cause the peculiar orthographic change mentioned above, which is dependent upon its letters, and not upon the affix as such.",
    "11063": "This <i>sutra</i> is a special exception to the previous aphorism which was too extensive. It declares, that when an affix is elided by using the words लुक्, श्लु, or लुप्, then the 'sign' or लक्षण or the peculiar virtue of the affix also vanishes. Thus there is an important difference in the elision of an affix by force of the words लुप् &c.; and by the word लोप. In one case the virtue of the affix subsists inspite of the elision, in the other it does not.\n\nThe word अङ्ग in this <i>sutra</i> requires some explanation. \"A root, followed by a suffix (<i>pratyaya</i>), is raised to the dignity of a base (<i>pratipadika</i>), and finally becomes a real word (<i>pada</i>) when it is finished by receiving a case-termination (<i>vibhakti</i>). Every base, with regard to the suffix which is attached to it, is called <i>Anga</i>, body.\"\n\nThus the word गर्गाः is the plural of the word गार्ग्यः. The word गार्ग्यः is formed by adding the affix यञ् to गर्ग [[4.1.105]]; the force of the indicatory ञ् being to cause the <i>vriddhi</i> of the first vowel of the word [[7.2.117]]. But in forming the plural of गार्ग्य, rule [[2.4.64]] presents itself, which declares that there is <i>luk</i> of the affix यञ् when the word takes the plural. Here the affix यञ् is elided by the word <i>luk</i>, which means not only the elision of the य of गार्ग्य but also the shortening of आ into अ, that is, the affix being elided, it vanishes altogether, leaving no trace behind, in the shape of the <i>vriddhing</i> of the first vowel, which the affix was competent to cause.\n\nSimilarly सृष्टः is the 3rd per. dual present tense of सृज् 'to clean.' It belongs to <i>Adadi</i> class in which the <i>vikarana</i> शप् is elided by '<i>luk</i>' [[2.4.72]]; and hence there is no <i>vriddhi</i> substitution, which would have taken place by [[7.2.114]], (the <i>ik</i> of the base सृज् is <i>vriddhied</i> before verbal affixes).\n\nSimilarly जुहुतः 'they two sacrifice'; here the <i>vikarana</i> शप् has been elided by using the word '<i>slu</i>' ([[2.4.75]], let <i>slu</i> be substituted in the room of <i>sap</i> after the verbs <i>hu</i>&c). The effect of this elision is, that there is no <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel of the base, which शप् was competent to cause.\n\nWhen an affix is elided in any other way than by the enunciation of the three terms containing लु, it is competent to cause its proper effect. Thus कृ + णिच् + यक् + ते = कारि + यक् + ते = कार् + यक् + ते = कार्यते. Here the elision of the affix <i>nich</i> is by '<i>lopa</i>,' [[6.4.51]] and hence though the affix vanishes, its effect remains. Why do we say 'in respect of an <i>Anga</i> or inflective base?' Observe पञ्च 'five,' सप्त 'seven,' पयः 'milk,' साम '<i>sama</i> <i>veda</i>.' Here in the word <i>pancha</i>, the plural case-affix is elided by (VII. I. 22) (after the words called <i>shat</i>, the जस् and शस् are elided by '<i>luk</i>'). Here the affix is elided by enouncing the word '<i>luk</i>,' the result is, that the affix cannot produce any change which it would otherwise have caused, in the <i>anga</i> or inflective base; such as lengthening, as in <i>rajan</i>, 'a king,' I. p. <i>rajanah</i> 'kings.' But though it is inoperative as regards the <i>anga</i>, the elided affix is not altogether inactive. It retains the virtue of raising the base to the dignity of a <i>pada</i>. Thus:- पंचन् + जस् = पंचन् + ०, (<i>luk</i> [[7.1.22]]). The word <i>panchan</i> is now a <i>pada</i>, and as such, it drops its final न्.",
    "11064": "This <i>sutra </i> defines टि. It is that portion of a word which is included between the last letter and the nearest vowel. Thus in the word अग्निचित् the portion इत् is टि; so also in सामसुत् the portion उत्. The word टि occurs in <i>sutra </i> [[3.4.79]].\n\nThe word अचः in the <i>sutra</i> is in the genitive case, which has the force of <i>nirdharana</i> or specification; and though it is in the singular number, it represents class name, meaning 'among the vowels.'",
    "11065": "This defines उपधा or penultimate. Thus in the words पच्, भिद्, बुध्, वृत् the letters अ, इ, उ, and ऋ are उपधा.\n\nThe word '<i>upadha</i>' occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.116]].",
    "11066": "This is a declaratory or interpreting <i>sutra</i>. When in a <i>sutra</i>, a word is used in the locative case, the operation ordained by that <i>sutra</i> is to be performed on the word preceding it. Thus in the <i>sutra</i> इको यणचि [[6.1.77]] the word अचि is in the locative case, which <i>sutra</i>, therefore, means that इ, उ, ऋ लृ followed by a vowel (अच्) are changed into य्, व्, र्, ल्, (यण्). The literal translation of the <i>sutra</i> being:- 'Of इक् there is यण् in अच्.' The force of 'in' or the locative case being to induce changes in the letter preceding the vowel. Thus दधि + उदकम् = दध्युदकम्; So मध्विदम्, पचत्योदनम् ॥\n\nThe word <i>nirdishta</i> (meaning 'exhibited') has been used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate immediateness. Thus in अग्निचित्, the इ of अग्नि the is not directly followed by the इ of चित्, there being the letter च् intervening, therefore, rule [[6.1.77]], does not apply here : and we have no <i>sandhi</i>.",
    "11067": "This <i>sutra</i> explains the force of words in the ablative case when employed in these aphorisms. As the locative case refers to a preceding word, so the ablative refers to a succeeding word.\n\nThus <i>sutra</i> [[8.4.61]] declares that 'after उद्, of <i>stha</i> and <i>stambha</i>, the substitute is a letter belonging to the class of the prior.' Thus उद् + स्थानम्. Here the word उदः is exhibited in the original <i>sutra</i> in the ablative case, and by the present <i>sutra</i> it means that a dental letter थ् must be substituted in the place of <i>sthana</i>, and by [[1.1.54]] <i>ante</i>, this dental takes the place of स्; we have उद् + थ्थानम् = उत्थ्-थानम्. Similarly in <i>sutra</i> तिङ् ङतिङः[[8.2.18]], 'a word ending in a conjugational affix, when following after a word ending in a non-conjugational affix, becomes <i>anudatta</i>.') Here the word '<i>atinah</i>' is exhibited in the ablative case, therefore, the operation directed by this aphorism, namely, the substitution of <i>anudatta</i> accent, must take place in the word that follows. Thus ओदनं पचति; but not so in पचत्योदनमिति ॥",
    "11068": "This is a rule of interpretation. The word स्वं which means 'one's own' denotes 'the meaning,' and the word रूप denotes 'the individual form of a word.' The sense of the <i>sutra</i> is that a word denotes both things expressed by those two words स्वं and रूप, viz., its meaning, and its form. Thus a rule applicable to अग्नि will be applicable to the word composed of अ, ग्, न्, इ and not to the words synonymous with <i>agni</i>, such as, पाककः, ज्वलनः &c.\n\nIn this science, therefore, the very word-form is to be taken, and understood and operated upon, and not external sense: with the exception of words which are definitions, in the latter case the things defined are to be taken.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is begun in order to remove the difficulty which might otherwise arise from a consideration that a word connotes a certain meaning, and as no grammatical operation is possible in a concrete object, we must take the words having the same meaning. As when a person is called to bring a 'cow,' he brings the animal cow, and not the letters c, o, w. It may therefore be said, that as no grammatical operation is possible in a material thing, we may take all the names synonymous with the word and operate upon them; this <i>sutra</i> removes that doubt.\n\nThus the <i>sutra</i> अग्नेर्ढक् [[4.2.33]] declares:- \"that the affix '<i>dhak</i>' comes after the word '<i>agni</i>'.\" Thus अग्नि + ढक् = आग्नेयम् \"belonging to <i>agni</i>,\" as in the following sentence आग्नेयमष्टाकपालं निर्वपेत्. Here the word अग्नि indicates the individual word-form अग्नि and not its synonyms. Similarly <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.19]] declares :- 'let there be optionally ठक् after उदश्वित्.' As औदश्वित्कम् [[7.3.50]] and [[7.3.51]] or औदश्वितम्. The rule applies to the word-form '<i>udasvita</i>' meaning 'curd-milk' and not to तक्र, अरिष्ट, कालशेप, दण्डाहत and मथित, which are synonyms.\n\nThere is an important exception to this rule, and that is in favour of terms which are technical terms of Grammar and have been so defined.\n\nThus दाधाघ्वदाप् (1. 1. 20) and तरप्तमपौ घः [[1.1.22]]. Here the words 'घु' and 'घ' denote the words connoted by those terms and not to their word-form. There are, however, some <i>sutras</i> in <i>Panini</i> which are apparently exceptions to this rule. These exceptions have been arranged under four heads, technically called सित्, पित्, जित्, and झित्. When there is a rule about a word, it may mean that very word-form, or words representing species falling under that word, or words which are synonymous with it. Thus rule [[2.4.12]] declares, :- \"वृक्ष 'tree' मृग 'deer,' तृण 'grass,' &c., may optionally be compounded as <i>dvandva</i>.\" Here the word वृक्ष stands as a generic name for the species falling under it, and does not represent the word-form, वृक्ष. Thus we have <i>dvandva</i>-compound of प्लक्ष + न्यग्रोध, as प्लक्षन्यग्रोधम् or प्लक्षन्यग्रोधाः । Such <i>sutras</i> are called सित्.\n\nThen in <i>sutra </i> [[3.4.40]], we have an example of पित्. That <i>sutra</i> means \"the word पुष 'to feed' takes the affix णमुल (अम्) when compounded with the word स्व.\" Here the word 'स्व' means both the word-form स्व, as well as the synonyms of स्व and the species of स्व. Thus स्व and धन 'wealth' are synonyms; while स्व 'wealth' and गो 'cow' are genus and species. Thus स्व + पुष् + णमुल् = स्वपोषम्. Similarly रैपोषम्, धनपोषम्, गोपोषम्, अश्वपोषम्. Such <i>sutras</i> are called पित्.\n\nThen in <i>sutra</i> [[2.4.23]], we have an example of जित्. \"A <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound ending with the word सभा 'court' is neuter, provided that it is preceded by the word <i>raja</i>, or by a word denoting a non-human being.\" Here the synonyms only of the word '<i>raja</i>' are taken, and neither the word-form '<i>raja</i>,' nor the special instances falling under it. Thus इन 'king' + सभा = इनसभम् 'king's assembly,' ईश्वर + सभा = ईश्वरसभम् 'king's assembly.' But not राजसभम्, but राजसभा. Nor can we take particular kings, such as चन्द्रगुप्त or पुष्पमित्र. In their case we must have पुष्पमित्रसभा, चन्द्रगुप्तसभा.\n\nThen in <i>sutra</i> [[4.4.35]], we have an example of झित्. The <i>sutra</i> means \"the words पक्षि 'bird' मत्स्य 'fish' मृग 'deer,' take the affix ठक् when the meaning is the killer thereof.\" Here the words पक्षि &c. denote both the word-forms पक्षि &c. as well as the species denoted by those terms, but not their synonyms. Thus पक्षि + ठक् = पाक्षिकः 'a bird-killer,' मात्स्यिकः, 'a fish-catcher.' शकुनि + ठक् = शाकुनिकः 'a vulture-killer.' But we cannot take the synonyms of 'पक्षि,' &c. except in the case of 'मत्स्य,' when we may take the word 'मीन.' As मात्स्यिकः and मैनिकः a fish killer.'",
    "11069": "The <i>pratyahara</i> अण् in thus <i>sutra</i> includes all the vowels and liquids. This is the only instance where अण् <i>pratyahara</i> refers to the second ण् of लण्. The letters included in अण्, and the letters having an indicatory उ, refer to, and include their homogeneous letters also. Thus कु refers to all the five gutturals क, ख, ग, घ, ङ, similarly चु, टु, तु, and पु, as in <i>sutra</i> (1. 3. 8). Similarly अ includes short, long and protracted अ. The words 'its own form' are understood in this <i>sutra</i>, being drawn from the previous <i>sutra</i>. Thus <i>sutra</i> आद्गुणः [[6.1.87]], 'when a vowel comes after अ, <i>guna</i> is the single substitute for both.' Here though the rule mentions only short अ, we take the long आ also. Thus not only नर + ईशः = नरेशः; but महा + ईशः = महेशः । So also in <i>sutra</i> अस्य च्वौ [[7.4.32]], 'there is long ई in the room of अ when the affix '<i>chvi</i>' [[5.4.50]] follows.' Here long आ is also included; thus कृष्ण + करोति = कृष्णीकरोति, and खट्वा + करोति = खट्वीकरोति. So also in <i>sutra</i> यस्येति च [[6.4.148]]. 'When long ई follows, there is elision of the इ or अ of the base,' the rule applies to the bases ending in long ई and आ also.\n\nThis rule of course does not apply to affixes. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.168]], says, 'after words ending in the affix <i>san</i>, and the words <i>asansa</i> and <i>bhiksha</i>, there is उ.' Here उ is an affix and therefore does not include long ऊ. Thus भिक्षुः 'a beggar.' So also in [[4.3.9]], the short अ only is to be taken and not the long one.",
    "11070": "By the previous <i>sutra</i> it was declared that a vowel standing by itself included all the letters of its class. Thus अ includes आ; and इ, ई; &c. This <i>sutra</i> lays down the rule by which the very form of the letter is taken and not all the letters of its class. This is done by placing a त् either after or before the letter. Thus अत् means the very letter अ and not all its homogeneous letters. Similarly उत् means short उ only and not long or protracted उ. We had to refer to this <i>sutra</i>, in our very first <i>sutra</i>, in explaining the term आत्.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> consists of two words तपरः and तत्कालस्य. <i>Taparah</i> means that which has a त् after it or that which is after त्. <i>Tat</i>-<i>kala</i> means having the same time. According to time the vowels are divided into short, long and protracted. Short vowels have one measure, long vowels two, and protracted vowels three. A consonant lasts half the time of a short vowel. Therefore a letter preceded or followed by त्, refers to its own form as well as to those only of its homogeneous letters which have the same time. Thus the letter अत् will include the <i>udatta</i>, <i>anudatta</i>, <i>svarita</i> (both nasalised and non-nasalised) अ and not the long and protracted forms. \n\nThis <i>sutra</i> declares an injunction. The <i>anuvritti</i> of अण् of the previous <i>sutra</i> does not run into this <i>sutra</i>. Any other letter than अण् may be followed by त् and the rule of this <i>sutra</i> will apply to that also. This rule qualifies the previous <i>sutra</i> which would therefore mean that an अण् letter which is not followed or preceded by a त् includes its homogeneous letters also.\n\nThus in the <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.9]] अतोभिस ऐस्. 'After words ending in अत् (i. e. short अ), ऐस् takes the place of भिस्.' Thus वृक्षः. But in खट्वा which ends in long आ and whose prosodial time is different from अ, this rule will not apply, and we have खट्वाभिः.",
    "11071": "This <i>sutra</i> explains the mode of interpreting <i>pratyaharas</i>. Thus the <i>pratyahara</i> अक् means those letters whose beginning is अ and whose final इत् is क्.\n\nWhy do we say with 'the final indicatory letter?' Because a <i>pratyahara</i> like सुट् would be otherwise ambiguous. It might be doubted whether it is formed with the final ट् of औट् and refers to the first five case-affixes, or whether it is formed with the initial ट् of टा and therefore refers to the first seven case-affixes. The present <i>sutra</i> clears up the doubt. A <i>pratyahara</i> is formed with the final इत् and not with the initial इत्.",
    "11072": "This <i>sutra</i> consists of three words :- येन 'by what (attribute),' विधिः 'rule,' तदन्तस्य 'having that (attribute) at its end.'\n\nThis is a rule of interpretation. When a rule is made with regard to a particular attribute or letter, it means also words having those attributes or letters at their end. Thus there is a rule [[3.1.97]] declaring \"let there be the affix यत् after the vowels.\" Here the phrase \"after the vowels\" means and includes \"after the roots ending in vowels, as well as roots consisting of a single vowel.\" Thus चि + यत् = चेयम्. Therefore, this <i>sutra</i> means that when a rule is laid down in this grammar with regard to a particular attribute, that rule, besides being applicable to that particular attribute, is also applicable to words ending in that particular attribute. Thus a rule laid down generally with regard to vowels, will apply to words ending in vowels; a rule laid down with regard to certain forms, will apply to words ending in those forms.\n\nThus the <i>sutra</i> एरच् [[3.3.56]] 'after इ there is अच् 'declares that the affix <i>ach</i> would come not only after इ, but after any expression that ends in इ. Thus इ + अच् = अयः, चि + अच् = चयः ॥\n\nVart:- The present rule, (called <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i>) must not be applied to rules relating to compounds (<i>samasa</i>), and to <i>pratyayas</i> (affixes). Thus <i>sutra </i> [[2.1.24]], declares that a word in the accusative case is compounded with the words <i>srita</i>, <i>atita</i> &c. As कष्टं + श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'involved in pain.' The present <i>sutra</i> must not be applied here, and we cannot say that a word in the accusative case would be compounded with another that ends in <i>srita</i>; for <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> does not apply here. Hence we cannot form a compound of कष्टं + परमश्रितः ॥\n\nSimilarly, in rules of affixes. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.99]] declares \"that the words नड &c., take the affix फक्.\" Thus नड+ फक् = नाडायनः । But we cannot apply the affix <i>phak</i> to the word सूत्रनड, the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> not being applicable here. The descendant of सूत्रनड will be called सोत्रनाडि and not as above.\n\nThe above <i>vartika</i> is however qualified by the following:\n\nVart:- The above <i>vartika</i> does not apply to words formed by affixes that have an indicatory उक् (उ, ॠ, लृ), short or long, or where a rule is propounded with regard to letters. Thus the affix <i>ktavatu</i> [[1.1.26]] has an indicatory उ, and we have कृतवत्. A rule which will apply to <i>kritavat</i> will apply also to the word which ends in <i>kritavat</i>. Thus the feminine of <i>kritavat</i> is कृतवती [[4.1.6]], the feminine of <i>sukritavat</i> will be <i>sukritavati</i>. Similarly rule (IV. I. 95) अत इञ् says \"after अ there is the affix इञ्.\" This is a rule relating to <i>pratyayas</i>, but as it is propounded by mere letters, the rule of <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> will apply here. Thus दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षि 'the son of <i>Daksha</i>.'\n\nVart:- When a term, which denotes a letter, is exhibited in a rule in the form of the locative case and qualifies something else which likewise stands in the locative case, that which is qualified by it must be regarded as beginning with the letter which is denoted by the term in question, and not as ending with it.\n\nThus <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.77]], <i>achi</i> <i>snu</i> <i>dhatu</i> <i>bhruvam</i> <i>yvor</i> <i>iyan</i> <i>uvanau</i>, means \"<i>iyan</i> and <i>uvan</i> are the substitutes of what ends with the <i>pratyaya</i> <i>snu</i> and what ends in a verbal root in इ or उ, whether long or short, and of the inflective base <i>bhru</i>, when an affix beginning with a vowel follows.\" Here the word '<i>achi</i>' is exhibited in the seventh case, which literally means 'when a vowel follows;' but by virtue of the present <i>vartika</i> it means, 'when an affix beginning with a vowel follows,' as, श्रियः, भ्रुवः ॥",
    "11073": "This defines the word वृद्धम्. The <i>sutra</i> consists of five words :- वृद्धिः 'the <i>vriddhi</i> vowel;' यस्य 'whose,' अचाम् 'among the vowels,' आदिः 'is first;' तद् 'that; वृद्धम् 'is called <i>vriddham</i>.'\n\nIf a word consisting of many vowels, has a <i>vriddhi</i> vowel coming first in the order of vowels, that word is called <i>vriddham</i>. Thus the words माला, शाला &c., have the first vowel आ a <i>vriddhi</i> vowel, therefore, they are called <i>vriddham</i>.\n\nThe word <i>vriddham</i> has been defined in order to make applicable to these peculiar words certain <i>taddhita</i> affixes. Thus there is a rule [[4.2.114]] by which the affix छ् is added to <i>vriddham</i>. Thus माला + छ् = मालीयः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"the first?\" Because a word like सभासंनयनः, which is not a <i>vriddha</i> word, will not admit of the affix छ्. Its corresponding derivative will be साभासंनयनः ॥\n\nVart:- A proper noun, though not coming under the above definition, may yet be regarded optionally as a <i>vriddham</i>. Thus देवदत्त + छ् = देवदत्तीया, or we may have दैवदत्ता.\n\nVart:- A compound ending in a <i>Gotra</i> word, is regarded for the purposes of the addition of this affix, as if it was not compounded. Thus रौढि is a <i>Gotra</i> word and also <i>vriddham</i>. Its compound घृतरौढि will be regarded as a <i>vriddham</i> too, for the addition of the affix. As घृतरौढि + छ् = घृतरौढीयाः 'the students of <i>Ghritaraudhi</i>.' So also ओदनपाणिनीयाः, वृद्धाम्भीयाः वृद्धकाश्यपीयाः &c.\n\nVart:- Exception must be made in the case of जिह्वाकात्य and हरितकात्य । They do not take छ्. Thus जैह्वाकाता and हारितकाताः.",
    "11074": "The त्यद् &c. have been given in the list of <i>sarvanamas</i>. See <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.27]]. These words are also called <i>vriddham</i>. Thus तद् + छ् = तदीयम्, एतदीयम्, मदीयम् इदमीयम्, अदसीयम्, त्वादायनिः, मादायनिः &c.",
    "11075": "As गोनर्द is a country of the east, it is a <i>vriddham</i> word and we have गोनर्द + छ् = गोनर्दीयः; similarly एणीपचनीयम्, भोजकटीयः.\n\nThe word <i>prak</i> in the <i>sutra</i> has been differently interpreted. The Grammarian <i>Kunin</i> takes the word <i>prak</i> as an epithet qualifying the word <i>acharya</i>, 'professor' understood. In that case the <i>sutra</i> will be thus translated:- 'In the opinion of the Eastern (or ancient) professors, a word that has the letters e and o as the first among its vowels, and is the name of a country, is called <i>vriddham</i>.' Under this interpretation, this will be an optional rule only, giving the opinion of eastern or ancient grammarians.\n\nOthers however take the word <i>prak</i> as qualifying the word <i>desa</i> and the meaning then is as given in the text.\n\nWhy do we say 'having the letters ए and ओ'? If a simple vowel is first among the vowels, of a word, that word will not be called <i>vriddham</i>: and as such will not take the affix छ्; as आहिच्छत्रः, कान्यकुब्जः. \n\nWhy do we say of 'Eastern country'? Because this rule does not apply to a word like देवदत्तः which is the name of a town in the <i>Punjab</i>, which is not an eastern country. Its secondary derivative will be दैवदत्तः, born in <i>Devadatta</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'country'? The rule will not apply to rivers &c. Thus from गोमति we have गौमताः 'fish born in the river <i>Gomati</i>.'",
    "12001": "This is an <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i>, and makes certain affixes, though not having an indicatory ङ्, to produce the same effect as if they were really ङित्.\n\nThe root गाङ् is substituted for the verb इङ् in certain tenses, in which the verb इङ् is defective [[2.4.49]]. The कुटादि verbs are roots belonging to the <i>Tudadi</i> class of verbs, and they are forty roots beginning with कुट् 'to be crooked' and ending with कुङ् 'to groan.'\n\nAfter these roots all affixes are treated as if they were marked with a ङ् with the exception of those affixes which are ञित् or णित्.\n\nThus from गाङ् we have in the aorist the form अध्यगीष्ट; which is thus evolved. अधि + अद् + इङ् + सिच् + त = अध्य + गा + स् + त (II. 4. 50.) = अध्य + गी + स्त [[6.4.66]] = अध्यगीष्ट 'he studied,' अध्यगीषातां 'they two studied'; अध्यगीषत 'they studied.' Here by [[6.4.66]], the आ is changed into ई before the affix सिच्, which is regarded as ङित्.\n\nSimilarly, after the verbs कुट् &c., all affixes are treated as ङित्, with the exceptions already mentioned.\n\nThus कुट् + तृच् [[3.1.133]] = कुट् + इट् + तृच् [[7.2.35]] = कुटितृ, nominative singular कुटिता 'who acts crookedly.' Here the affix तृच् being, regarded as ङित् does not cause the <i>guna</i> substitution of the उ of कुट्, by (I. I. 15).\n\nSimilarly with the affixes तुमुन् and तव्यम्, we have कुटितुम् and कुटितव्यम्. So on with all the forty roots of <i>kutadi</i> class : e.g. उत्पुटिता, उत्पुटितुम्, उत्पुटितव्यम्.\n\nBut the affixes marked with ञ् or ण् will not be so treated. Thus णिच् by which causatives are formed, is such an affix; e.g. उत्कुट् + णिच् + शप् + तिप् = उत्कोट् + इ + अ + ति = उत्कोटयति. Here there is <i>guna</i> of the उ of कुट्. So also before the affix णल् of the perfect tense, we have उच्चुकोट, and before the affix ण्वुल् we have उत्कोटकः ।\n\n<i>Vartika</i>:- The root व्यच् 'to deceive,' is also treated like <i>kutadi</i> verbs, except before the affix अस्. As विचिता 'he shall deceive,' विचितुम् 'for the purpose of deceiving' विचितव्यम् &c. Here there is <i>samprasarana</i> before the <i>nit</i> terminations ता, तुम् and तव्यम् and the य of व्यच् is changed into इ by rule (VI. I. 16).\n\nBut the affix अस् is not <i>nit</i> and consequently there is no <i>samprasarana</i> before it. Thus उरुव्यचाः 'an imp.'",
    "12002": "The root विज् does not strengthen its vowel before the affixes that take the intermediate इ, because those terminations are treated like ङित् affixes. The root विज् belongs to the <i>Tudadi</i> class. Thus उद्विजिता 'he will be agitated,' उद्विजितुम् 'for the purpose of being agitated,' उद्विजितव्यम् 'ought to be agitated.'\n\nBut those affixes, which are not preceded by the augment इट्, are not like ङित्, and they consequently produce their own proper action, such as <i>gunation</i> &c. As उत् + विज् + ल्युट् = उद्वेजनम्, उद्वेजनीयम् 'that which ought to be agitated.'",
    "12003": "Thus before the इडादि termination इता of the future, we may have either प्रोर्णुविता or प्रोर्णविता \"he will cover.\"\n\nThe equation of the form is :- प्र + ऊर्णु + इ + ता = प्र + ऊर्णुव् + इता [[6.4.77]] = प्रोर्णुविता. When the affix is not regarded as ङित्, it produces <i>guna</i>, and we have the second form प्रोर्णविता ॥\n\nOf course there is no option allowed before those affixes which do not take the augment इट्, and before those terminations, consequently, we have only one form : as प्रोर्णु + ल्युट् = प्रोर्णो + अनम् = प्रोर्णवनम्, 'covering,' प्रोर्णवनीयम् 'which ought to be covered.'",
    "12004": "The terminations which are added to roots are either <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> or <i>ardhadhatuka</i>. The <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> terminations are all those that are marked with a श् and also the tense terminations called तिङ्, the latter are the following:-\n\n<i>Parasmaipada</i>\n\n- 3rd Person. तिप् तस् झि\n- 2nd Person. सिप् थस् थ\n- Ist Person. मिप् वस् मस्\n\n<i>Atmanepada</i>\n\n- 3rd Person. त आताम् झ\n- 2nd Person. थास् आथाम् ध्वम्\n- Ist Person. इट् वहि महिङ्\n\nExcept the terminations marked with a प् such as ति, सि and मि, &c., all the other <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> terminations are ङित्. The शित् terminations like शतृ, शानच्, &c., are also <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> terminations. These affixes are also ङित्, unless they have a प् as indicatory, as शप्. Thus the affix as तस्, being an अपित् <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix, is a ङित्, and before it the vowel is not <i>gunated</i> e. g. कुरुतः 'they two do.' The equation is :- कृ + उ + तस् (the उ is added by Rule [[3.1.79]]) = कर् + उ + तस् [[6.4.110]] = कुरु + तस् = कुरुतः ॥ Similarly कुर्वन्ति 'they do.'\n\nHere the अ of कर् is changed into उ and we have कुर्, by virtue of rule [[6.4.110]], which declares that the अ of the verb कर् is changed into उ before those <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes which are ङित् or कित्. Here तस् is a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> ङित् affix by the present rule, and hence the change.\n\nThese four <i>sutras</i> describe the ङित् terminations.\n\nWhy do we say 'a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix'? Because an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix, though not being marked with an indicatory प् will not be a ङित्. As कर्त्ता 'doer,' कर्तुम् 'to do,' कर्तव्यम् 'duty.'\n\nWhy do we say 'not having an indicatory प्'? If a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix has an indicatory प् it will not be <i>nit</i>. As कृ + उ + तिप् = करोति 'he does' करोषि 'thou doest,' करोमि 'I do.'",
    "12005": "With this <i>sutra</i> begins the description of affixes which are regarded as कित् though not actually having a क् to mark them as such. The terminations of लिट् (Perfect) not being पित् terminations, are कित्, after verbs that have no compound consonants. The phrase अपित् (not being marked with प्) qualifies this <i>sutra</i> also, being drawn from the previous <i>sutra</i> by the rule of <i>Anuvritti</i>.\n\nThus from भिद् 'to tear' the Reduplicated non <i>pit</i> second person perfect is बिभिदतुः 'thou hast torn.' बिभिदुः 'They have torn.'\nSimilarly चिच्छिदतुः 'thou hast divided'; चिच्छिदुः 'you divided'; ईजतुः and ईजुः.\n\nThis rule will not apply if the root ends in a conjunct consonant. Thus स्रंस् 'to fall down' forms its second person Perfect :- सस्रंस् + अतुस् = सस्रंसतुः. Here the affix is not treated as <i>kit</i>; for had it been so treated, it would have caused the elision of the penultimate nasal (<i>anusvara</i>) of स्रंस by Rule [[6.4.24]]. Similarly from ध्वंस् we have दध्वंसे.\n\nThe <i>pit</i> terminations of the Perfect are not <i>kit</i>; and therefore we have बिभेद 'he has divided,' where the root is <i>gunated</i> before the 3rd person singular termination णल् which is a पित् termination, because it being the substitute of तिप् is regarded like तिप् by [[1.1.56]].",
    "12006": "After these two roots the terminations of the Perfect are कित्. These roots have been especially mentioned, because the root इन्धि ending in a compound consonant will not be governed by <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.5]]; and the root भू is mentioned because all the terminations of the Perfect are कित् after भू, not excepting the पित् terminations. Thus the verbs समीधे and ईधे are illustrations of Perfect Tense from the root इन्ध् as in the following examples :- समीधे दस्युहन्तमम्, (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI. 16. 15), and पुत्र ईधे अथर्वणः, (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI. 16. 14). Here the nasal of the root is dropped by regarding the affix as कित् ॥ Similarly from the root भू, we have बभूव, वभूविथ ॥\n\nVart.:- This rule should be applied also to the verbs श्रंथ् 'to loosen,' श्रंथ् 'to fasten,' दंभ् 'to injure' and स्वंज् 'to embrace.' As श्रेथतुः 'thou hast loosened,' श्रंथ + अतुस् = श्रथ् + अतुस्. (The न् is elided by the rule already mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i>, viz. [[6.4.24]].\n\n= श्रथ् + श्रथ् + अतुस् = श्रेथतुः [[6.4.120]], Similarly श्रेथतुः; देभतुः, परिषस्वजे, परिषस्वजाते.",
    "12007": "After these seven verbs, the gerundial <i>ktva</i> is <i>kit</i>. It might be said, what was the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>? The affix <i>ktva</i> is clearly a <i>kit</i> affix, as it is marked with the diacritical letter क्, and it was useless to call it a <i>kit</i> affix after these verbs. The reason of this apparent repitition is this. Though <i>ktva</i> is a <i>kit</i> affix generally; yet there is a later <i>sutra</i> in this chapter [[1.2.18]] which declares that the prefix क्त्वा is not कित्, if it is preceded by the intermediate इ. Or in other words, if क्त्वा is added to those verbs, which are called सेट् verbs, viz., that take an intermediate इ, it is not then <i>kit</i>. Thus the verb शी 'to sleep' is सेट्. Therefore शी + इ + त्वा = शे + इ + त्वा = शायित्वा.\n\nNow it happens that all the seven verbs mentioned in the <i>sutra</i> are सेट् verbs, and take an intermediate इ. The क्त्वा before these verbs would have lost its <i>kitness</i> by virtue of <i>sutra</i> 18; therefore arose the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>, to provide in anticipation an exception to that <i>sutra</i>, in favour of these verbs, where the affix <i>ktva</i> is necessarily <i>kit</i>. Thus we have मृडित्वा 'being gracious,' मृदित्वा 'having squeezed,' गुधित्वा 'having wrapped' कुषित्वा 'having torn,' क्लिशित्वा 'having suffered,' उदित्वा 'having spoken,' उषित्वा 'having dwelt.' The व v of वद् and वस् are changed into उ by the rule of <i>Samprasarana</i> [[6.1.15]].\n\nMoreover in the case of the verbs गुद्, कुष् and क्लिश्, <i>sutra</i> 26 would have made क्त्वा optionally <i>kit</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> makes it necessarily so.",
    "12008": "After the above mentioned verbs the <i>ktva</i> though taking an intermediate इ, and the affix सन् are कित्. The affix सन् is employed in forming desiderative verbs. The न् of सन् is इत्, the real affix being स. The root is reduplicated before this सन् affix. Thus रुदित्वा 'having cried,' रुरुदिषति 'he wishes to cry'; विदित्वा 'having known,' विविदिषति 'he wishes to know'; गृहीत्वा (VI. 1. 16.) 'having taken,' जिघृक्षति 'he wishes to take'; मुषित्वा 'having stolen,' मुमुषिषति 'he wishes to steal'; सुप्त्वा [[6.1.15]] 'having slept,' सुषुप्सति 'he wishes to sleep,' पृष्ट्वा (VI. I. 16) 'having asked' पिपृच्छिषति 'he wishes to ask.' The verb ग्रह् is changed into गृह्, स्वप् into सुप्, प्रच्छ् into पृच्छ before <i>kit</i> affixes by <i>samprasarana</i> (VI. 1. 16.)\n\nThe <i>ktva</i> and <i>san</i> would have been optionally <i>kit</i> after the verbs रुद्, विद् and मुष् by virtue of Rule 26 of this chapter, but this <i>sutra</i> makes them necessarily so, after these three verbs. In the case of the verb ग्रह्, these affixes are <i>kit</i> by virtue of this <i>sutra</i> only. In the case of the verbs स्वप् and प्रच्छ् the affix क्त्वा is of course <i>kit</i>, because these two verbs are <i>anit</i>, that is, they do not take the intermediate इ; and therefore the क्त्वा being directly affixed to them, and rule 18 not applying, the indicatory k would make it <i>kit</i>. In reference to these verbs, therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> teaches something new, only with regard to the affix सन्, by making that also <i>kit</i>. The verb प्रच्छ् takes the intermediate इ when the affix सन् follows, by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.75]].",
    "12009": "In this <i>sutra</i> there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of सन् only and not of क्त्वा. The <i>sutra</i> literally translated means:-\"After <i>ik</i> the <i>jhal</i>.\" The <i>Pratyahara</i> इक् contains the four letters इ, उ, ऋ, लृ. The <i>Pratyahara</i> झल् contains all the consonants, except the nasals and the liquids. After the verbs ending in इक् the desiderative suffix सन् is <i>kit</i>, when it is झलादि, that is to say when the affix सन् does not take the intermediate इ. The affix सन् is an affix which begins with स् a letter of the झल् class. But if the intermediate इ is added before it, it is no longer a झलादि affix, and in that case it is not कित्. Thus from जि 'to conquer,' which is a verb ending in इक्, we have जिगीषति 'he wishes to conquer', यु 'to mix' युयूषति; so also कृ 'to do,' चिकीर्षति, तृ 'to cross' तितीर्षति, भू 'to be' बुभूषति ।\n\nIf however, verbs ending in इ or उ or ऋ or लृ, take an intermediate इ, they likewise take <i>guna</i>. As:- स्मि 'to smile' takes <i>guna</i>, and makes its desiderative सिस्मयिषति.\n\nThe झलादि सन् is not <i>kit</i> after verbs ending in any other letter than the इक्. As पिपासति (from पा) 'he wishes to drink.' So from स्था we have तिष्ठासति.\n\nThe object of making the affix सन् <i>kit</i> affix after verbs ending in <i>ik</i> vowels, is to prevent the <i>guna</i> of the vowel of the root, as in चिचीषति 'wishes to collect', तुष्टूषति 'wishes to praise.' To this it might be objected \"this cannot be : for rule [[6.4.16]] (when सन् beginning with a <i>jhal</i>, i.e., not preceded by the augment इट् follows, a long vowel is the substitute of verbs ending in a vowel, and of the verbs हन् and गम्) would prevent <i>guna</i> by substituting long vowel.\" To this it may be replied: \"if rule [[6.4.16]], enjoining long vowel, debars rule [[7.3.84]] requiring <i>guna</i>, it should a fortiori debar rule [[6.4.51]] which requires the elision of the affix णि before <i>Ardhadhatuka</i> affixes not taking the augment इट्. But evidently that is not so; for the elision of णि is not debarred by [[6.4.16]]. Therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> is made, so that even by giving scope to the rule of lengthening, the affix सन् be treated as कित्.\" Thus in चिचीषति scope is given to rule [[6.4.16]], and the vowel is lengthened. But this rule in its turn will be debarred in those cases where rule [[6.4.51]] will apply : in such cases the maxim contained in [[1.4.2]] is our guide, and a subsequent rule will debar a prior rule of <i>Panini</i> when both find their scope in a single case. Thus in forming the desiderative of the verb ज्ञप् 'to inform,' both the rules [[6.4.16]] and [[6.4.51]] present themselves, but the latter prevails. The verb ज्ञप् belongs to the <i>churadi</i> class of verbs, and takes the affix णिच्. Thus ज्ञप् + णिच् + सन् + तिप्; here the present <i>sutra</i> comes into force, and सन् being treated as कित्, the <i>guna</i> of the इ of ज्ञपि is prevented. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.84]] requiring <i>guna</i> being set aside, <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.51]] comes into play, and causes the elision of णिच् and we have ज्ञप् + स + ति = ज्ञीप्सति [[7.4.55]] (आ changed to ई) 'he wishes to inform.'",
    "12010": "Thus from भिद् 'to pierce' we have बिभित्सति 'he wishes to break,' here the root भिद् contains the <i>ik</i> vowel इ; it ends in a consonant द्; the affix सन् is directly added without taking an intermediate इ, and therefore it fulfils all the conditions of the <i>sutra</i>; and the vowel is not <i>gunated</i>.\n\nIf the final consonant of the verb is not preceded by a vowel of the <i>ik</i> class, the affix सन् is not <i>kit</i> after such a verb. As यज् + सन् + ते = यियक्षते 'wishes to sacrifice.' Had the affix सन् been here a <i>kit</i> affix, there would have been <i>samprasarana</i> by rule [[6.1.16]] which declares that there is <i>samprasarana</i> of the verbs वच्, स्वप्, and यज् &c., before <i>kit</i> affixes. \n\nIf the <i>san</i> takes the intermediate इ and is then no longer a झलादि सन् it is not <i>kit</i>; and causes <i>gunation</i> etcetera. As वृत् + इ + सन् = विवर्तिषते 'he desires to be.' Here there is <i>guna</i> of <i>ri</i>.\n\nRoots like दम्भ्, तृंह् &c., are governed by this rule, though they end in conjunct consonants, for the word हल् of the <i>sutra</i> means <i>jati</i> or class; thus दम्भ् + सन् + तिप् = दभ् + सति [[6.4.24]], the <i>m</i> being elided by treating सन् as कित्) = धीप्सति or धिप्सति [[7.4.56]].",
    "12011": "The <i>sutra</i> consists of two words लिङ्सिचौ and आत्मनेपदेषु, literally meaning \"the affixes <i>lin</i> and <i>sich</i> in the <i>Atmanepada</i>.\" The other phrases, given in the above text must be supplied from the previous <i>sutras</i>, to complete the sense. The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सन्, that began with <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.8]], does not extend further. As:- भित्सीष्ट 'may he break' and भुत्सीष्ट 'may he know,' अभित्त 'he broke', अबुद्ध 'he knew.'\n\nThus the root भिद् ends with a simple consonant, is preceded by इ a letter of <i>ik</i> <i>pratyahara</i> ; after this root the <i>jhaladi</i> affix सीष्ट of Benedictive in the <i>Atmanepada</i> is treated like कित्; therefore there is no <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel of the root before this affix. भिद् + सीष्ट = भित्सीष्ट. Similarly in the Aorist we have अभित्त = अ + भिद् + सिच् + त, the स of the Aorist being elided by [[8.2.26]]. So also बुध् + सीष्ट = भुत् + सीष्ट [[8.2.37]] = भुत्सीष्ट.\n\nIf the final consonant is not preceded by an <i>ik</i> vowel, this rule will not apply. Thus Ben. यज् + सीष्ट = यष् + सीष्ट [[8.2.36]] = यक् + सीष्ट [[8.2.41]] = यक्षीट [[8.3.58]]. Similarly its Aorist is अयष्ट. Had the affixes सीष्ट and त been <i>kit</i>, they would have caused <i>samprasarana</i> of य by [[6.3.16]].\n\nThis rule will not apply, if the Benedictive and Aorist affixes are <i>Parasmaipadi</i>. Thus the Aorist of सृज् 'to let off,' is अ + सृज् + सीत् = अ + सृज् + अ + ज् + सीत् [[6.1.58]] = अस्रज् + सीत् [[6.1.77]] = अस्राक्षीत् (VII. 2. I). Similarly from दृश् we have Aorist <i>Parasmaipadi</i> अद्राक्षीत्. Had the Aorist been कित्, rule [[6.1.58]] (अम् is the augment of the verbs सृज् and दृश् when an affix beginning with a <i>jhal</i> and not having an indicatory क् follows), would not have applied.\n\nThis rule will also not apply, if the verb ends in a vowel. Thus of the verb चि, we have Ben. चेषष्टि, Aor. अचेष्ट. Had the affixes been कित्, there would have been no <i>guna</i> substitution of <i>i</i> into <i>e</i>.\n\nThe rule will not apply, if these affixes are not <i>jhaladi</i>, but take the augment इट्. Thus Ben. वृत् + इषीष्ट = वर्तिषीष्ट, so also Aorist अवर्तिट. Had they been कित्, there would have been no <i>guna</i> substitution.\n\nThis rule, of course, is confined to the Benedictive and the Aorist. Other tenses will not be affected by this rule. Thus the Ist and 2nd Future of द्विष् is द्वेष्टा and द्वेक्ष्यति.",
    "12012": "As from कृ 'to do' the benedictive is कृषीष्ट 'may he do.' So also सिच्, as अकृत 'he did.' So also हृषीष्ट and अहृत.\n\nOf course this rule would not apply if these terminations take the intermediate इ; as वृ + इषीष्ट = वरिषीष्ट 'may he choose,' (Benedictive); अ + वृ + इष्ट = अवरिष्ट or अवरीष्ट 'he chose or covered,' the इ being lengthened by [[7.2.38]].",
    "12013": "The verb गम् 'to go' is <i>Atmanepadi</i> after the preposition सम् by Rule [[1.3.29]].\n\nThe result of its being <i>kit</i> is that the nasal is dropped in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, in forming the Aorist with सिच्, and the Bencdictive. Thus we have the forms :- संगंसीष्ट or संगसीष्ट in the Benedictive; and समगत or समगंस्त in the <i>sich</i> Aorist. These forms are thus evolved :-\n\nसम्  + गम् + सीष्ट = सम् + ग + सीष्ट [[6.4.37]] = संगसीष्ट 'may he combine.' Here the nasal म् of गम् is elided by treating the affix सीष्ट as कित् by Rule [[6.4.37]]. In the alternative we have संगंसीष्ट.\n\nSo in the aorist सम् + गम् + सिच् + त = सम् + अट् + गम् + त [[6.4.37]] = समगत. The सिच् being elided by [[8.2.27]] (after a short inflective base, there is elision of सिच्, if a <i>jhal</i> follows). So when म् of गम् is elided by [[6.4.37]], there remains only ग which is a base ending in short अ, hence, the elision of सिच्. But in the alternative we have समगंस्त.",
    "12014": "As आहत, आहसाताम्, आहसत are the aorist of हन्. When a सिच् or second aorist is <i>kit</i> the verb loses its nasal, by Rule [[6.4.37]]. After the verb हन् the सिच् is only <i>kit</i> and not the Benedictive लिङ् terminations, as was the case in the previous <i>sutra</i>; hence the repetition of the word <i>sich</i> in this <i>sutra</i>. The <i>sutras</i> [[1.2.12]] and [[1.2.13]] were governed both by लिङ् and सिच्; from and after this <i>sutra</i>, the governing power of लिङ् ceases. The governing power of the word \"<i>Atmanepada</i>\" in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.11]] does not however cease, and its <i>anuvritti</i> runs through the succeeding <i>sutras</i>; though as regards this <i>sutra</i>, its <i>anuvritti</i> is redundant, in as much as before the <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations, the root हन् is always replaced by वध् in the aorist, there is no necessity of making the affix <i>sich</i> a <i>kit</i>. For the object served in making <i>sich</i>, <i>kit</i>, after the verb हन्, is to elide the nasal, while in the case of वध्, no such purpose can be served.",
    "12015": "The word <i>gandhana</i> means 'to divulge,' 'to make known that which had been concealed.' The verb यम् has various meanings.\n\nThe result of <i>kit</i> is that the nasal is elided. The verb यम् becomes <i>Atmanepada</i> when preceded by the preposition आङ् by rule (1. 3. 28). Thus उत् + आ + यम् + त = उदायत = 'he divulged,' उदायसाताम्, उदायसत, the <i>sich</i> is elided by [[8.2.27]] and म् by [[6.4.37]]. When the verb यम् has any other meaning than 'to divulge,' then the सिच् in the <i>Atmanepada</i> is not <i>kit</i>; as उदायंस्त पादस् 'he raised the foot.' So also उदायंस्त कूपादुदकम् 'he raised water from the well.' Though here the verb <i>yam</i> is in the transitive form and takes an object after it, yet it is <i>Atmanepadi</i> by Rule [[1.3.75]] which declares \"after the verb <i>yam</i> to strive, preceded by सम्, उत् and आङ् when it does not refer to a book, the <i>Atmanepada</i> is employed.\"",
    "12016": "Thus उपायत कन्याम् or उपायंस्त कन्याम् 'he espoused the girl,' उपायत or उपायंस्त भार्याम् 'he espoused his wife.'\n\nThe word '<i>Upayamana</i>' in the <i>sutra</i> means 'to accept in marriage,' 'to espouse.' The verb यम् preceded by the preposition उप is <i>Atmanepadi</i> when it means 'to espouse' by Rule (1. 3. 56).",
    "12017": "The roots स्था 'to stand,' दा 'to give,' धा 'to place', दै 'to pity', धे 'to feed', दो 'to cut' change their vowels into इ before the terminations of the Aorist of the <i>Atmanepada</i> ; and those terminations are also <i>kit</i>. As उपास्थित, 'he worshipped', उपास्थिषाताम्, उपास्थिषत; 'he gave', अधित 'he fed.'",
    "12018": "We had had occasion to refer to this <i>sutra</i> in explaining <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.7]]. The affix <i>ktva</i> (the actual affix being <i>tva</i>, the <i>k</i> being merely <i>it</i> or indicatory letter) is on the face of it a <i>kit</i> affix. This <i>sutra</i> however limits its <i>kitness</i> to cases where it is not <i>set</i>. If it is <i>set</i>, i.e. has before it the intermediate इ it will not be treated like a <i>kit</i> affix. Thus in कृत्वा, हुत्वा, the affix त्वा is added directly to the root कृ 'to do' and हु 'to sacrifice,' without an intermediate इ and therefore the root has not been <i>gunated</i>, the affix here being <i>kit</i>. But in स्वेदित्वा, देवित्वा, वर्त्तित्वा, from स्विद्, दिव् and वृत् 'to sweat,' 'to shine,' 'to be,' the affix is not <i>kit</i>, because there is an intermediate इ before त्वा and the root has been consequently <i>gunated</i>.\n\nOf course this <i>sutra</i> relates to क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> only. Other affixes though having an intermediate इ will be treated as <i>kit</i>, if they have an indicatory क्. Thus the affix क्तिन् [[3.3.94]] by which feminine nouns are formed from roots is a कित् affix. This affix when सेट्, will remain कित्, as नि + ग्रह् + इट् + क्तिन् = नि + गृह् + इ + ति [[6.1.16]] = निगृहीतिः [[7.2.37]]. Here there is <i>samprasarana</i> by treating <i>klin</i> as <i>kit</i>. So also in उपस्निहितिः and निकुचितिः there is no <i>guna</i>. After ग्रह् &c., the affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् by a <i>Vartika</i> under <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.9]] which see.",
    "12019": "The <i>Nishthas</i> are <i>kta</i> and <i>ktavatu</i> (see <i>sutra</i> 26, Chapter I). They are obviously <i>kit</i> affixes. But in the case of the above five roots they are not <i>kit</i>, and the vowels take <i>guna</i>. Thus शयितः slept, शयितवान्, प्रस्वेदितः, प्रमेदितः, प्रक्ष्वेदितः, प्रस्वेदितवान्, प्रमेदितवान्, प्रक्ष्वेदितवान्, प्रधर्षितः, प्रधर्षितवान् &c. In all the above roots the <i>Nishtha</i> affixes are also <i>set</i>.\n\nThe roots स्विद् (ञिष्विदा), मिद् (ञिमिदा), क्षिद् (ञिक्षिदा) and धृष् (ञिधृषा) have all long आ as indicatory, as well as the syllable ञि. These roots therefore by Rule [[7.2.16]] are generally <i>anit</i>, and consequently beyond the scope of the operation of the present <i>sutra</i>. As स्विन्नः, स्विन्नवान्. But when the <i>Nishtha</i> affixes denote 'a state or condition, <i>bhava</i>,' or 'beginning of action,' then the above four roots optionally become <i>set</i>. [[7.2.17]]. It is in that case that the present <i>sutra</i> is applicable to them.",

    "12021": "According to some the <i>set</i> <i>Nishtha</i> suffixes are not <i>kit</i> after the verbs having a penultimate उ if those verbs are used impersonally (<i>bhava</i>) or denote the beginning of action (<i>adi</i>-<i>karman</i>). Thus द्युत् 'to shine', द्युतितमनेन or द्योतितमनेन 'it has been lighted.' Similarly प्रद्योतितः or प्रद्युतितः 'he first illumined.' The word penultimate or <i>upadha</i> has been defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]] <i>ante</i>.\n\nIf the verb has any other vowel than उ as penultimate, then the rule does not apply. As लिखितमनेन 'written by him.' Here इ is penultimate; and therefore no option is allowed.\n\nThis rule has no application where the <i>Nishtha</i> does not express either भाव 'condition' or 'Impersonal action'; or आदिकर्म 'if beginning of action', but is used as a verbal adjective. As रुचितं कार्षापाणं ददाति 'he gives a shining coin (called <i>karshapana</i>).' Here the word रुचित 'shining' is used as adjective.\n\nThe rule applies to the <i>Nishtha</i> which takes the intermediate इ and not to others as प्रभुक्त ओदनः 'the rice that has been eaten.' Here no option is allowed.\n\nThis optional form of past participle is restricted in its scope. Those verbs which take the <i>vikarana</i> शप् i.e., the verbs of the <i>Bhu</i> class &c., admit of this option.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of न सेट् however is to be read in this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nBy rule [[7.2.51]], after the verb पू the affixes <i>Nishtha</i> and क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> take the intermediate इ. So that क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> being <i>set</i> (by virtue of Rule [[7.2.51]]) would have been non-<i>kit</i> by Rule 18; and it might be asked what is the necessity of repeating it in this <i>sutra</i>, when <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.18]] comprised the case. The reason of this repetition is that by mentioning क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, it has governing force over the succeeding <i>sutras</i>. As पवितः, पवितवान्.",
    "12023": "The <i>set</i> <i>ktva</i> may or may not be <i>kit</i> after the verbs ending in थ् or फ् preceded by a nasal. The result of being <i>kit</i> will be that nasal will be dropped.

Thus from ग्रंथ् we have ग्रथित्वा or ग्रन्थित्वा 'having twisted,' गुफित्वा or गुंफित्वा 'having tied round', श्रथित्वा or श्रन्थित्वा.\n\nThe word \"<i>Nishtha</i>\" does not govern this <i>sutra</i>, and comes to an end with the last <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThis rule does not apply to verbs that have not a penultimate न् though they may end in थ् or फ्.

The वी itself is a compound of उ + इ = वि, in the dual वी. Therefore the phrase means \"after (verbs) having for their penultimate either इ <i>i</i> or उ <i>u</i> long or short.\"\n\n3. हलादेः means \"beginning with a consonant.\"\n\nAll these three words qualify the word \"verb\" understood.\n\n4. संश्च means \"and <i>san</i>.\"\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> means, those verbs which have a रल् letter in the end, a हल् in the beginning, and an इ, ई or उ, ऊ in their penultimate, may optionally treat the affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>san</i> as कित्.\n\nThus दद्युत् 'to shine,' makes दद्युतित्वा or द्योतित्वा 'having shone,' लिख् 'to write' makes लिखित्वा or लेखित्वा.\n\nSimilarly in <i>san</i> affix we have लिलिखिषति or लिलेखिषति 'he wishes to write', दिदद्युतिषते or दिद्योतिषते 'wishes to shine.'\n\nThe rule does not apply if the verb ends in a letter other than रल्. As दिव् + क्त्वा = देवित्वा; its desiderative will be दिदेविषति. No option is allowed here.\n\nSimilarly there is no option when the penultimate vowel is not इ or उ. As वृत्त् + क्त्वा = वर्तित्वा Des. विवर्तिषते.\n\nThe rule also does not apply if the verb does not begin with a consonant. As एषित्वा and एषिषिषति. There is no option allowed here.\n\nThe rule does not apply if the क्त्वा and सन् are <i>anit</i>. As भुक्त्वा, बुभुक्षते.\n\nIn these 26 <i>sutras</i> the description of affixes which are treated like ङित् and कित् is comprised.",
    "12027": "The उ <i>u</i> having one <i>matra</i> or measure is short, having two measures is long, having three measures is <i>pluta</i>. This <i>sutra</i> defines the three kinds of vowels according to their <i>matra</i>. The letter ऊ <i>u</i> has been taken to illustrate the rule. The phrase हृस्वदीर्घप्लुतः is a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, in the Singular, and is exhibited in the masculine gender, contrary to the general rule [[2.4.17]].\n\nThe word <i>kala</i> means measure of time required for pronouncing a vowel.\n\nAs दधि 'curd', मधु 'honey'. Here इ and उ are short. कुमारी, गौरी, here ई is long. देवदत्ता३ अन्वास <i>Devadatta</i>! Here आ <i>a</i> is <i>pluta</i> or prolated.\n\nThese words are used in the following <i>sutras</i>: (1. 2. 47); [[7.4.25]]; [[8.2.82]].",
    "12028": "This is a <i>paribhasha</i> <i>sutra</i>, and declares the object to which the terms 'short, 'long' and 'prolated' are to be applied. When in this book 'short' 'long' or 'prolated' are taught by using the words <i>hrasva</i>, <i>dirgha</i> or <i>pluta</i>, they must be understood to apply to vowels. As will be found in the <i>sutra</i> (1. 2. 47) \\[1\\] \"there is the substitution of <i>hrasva</i> or short in the neuter gender of the crude-form.\" The word 'vowel' must be inserted in this <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. That is:- the <i>hrasva</i> is substituted for the final vowel of the crude-form. As रै अतिरि, नौ अतिनु, गा उपगु.\n\nThe substitution must take the place of vowel and not consonant. As सुवाग् ब्राह्मणकुलम्.\n\nSimilarly <i>sutra</i> [[7.4.25]] \\[2\\] teaches \"There is the substitution of <i>dirgha</i> or 'long vowel' before all affixes beginning with the letter य्, except <i>krit</i> and <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes.\" Here also the word 'vowel' must be read into the <i>sutra</i> which will then be \"of an inflective base ending in a vowel, the long vowel shall be the substitute &c.\" As चि + यङ् + त = चीयते 'it is collected'; श्रु + य + त = श्रूयते 'it is heard.' Why do we say \"in the place of vowels only\"? The substitution must take place in the room of a vowel and not of a consonant. As भिद् + य + ते = भिद्यते 'it is divided,' छिद्यते 'it is pierced.'\n\nSo also in the case of <i>pluta</i> substitution. Thus rules [[8.2.82]] and [[8.2.84]] \\[3\\], declare that in calling from a distance, <i>pluta</i> is substituted for the टि portion of the word in the vocative. (The word टि is defined in [[1.1.64]]). Here also the phrase 'of the vowel' must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. The <i>sutra</i> will then read:- \"<i>Pluta</i> is substituted in the place of the vowel of the टि &c.\" Thus देवदत्त३, <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i>! यज्ञदत्त३ <i>O</i> <i>Yajnadatta</i> !\n\nWhy do we say \"in the place of vowels only\"? The substitution must be in the place of the vowel of the टि and not of the consonant. As अग्निचि३त्, सोमसु३त्. Here the syllables इत् and उत् are टि, and the vowels इ and उ have been prolated and not the consonant त्.\n\nThe substitution must be enunciated as such by using the terms, <i>hrasva</i>, <i>dirgha</i>, and <i>pluta</i>. Therefore it is not so here; द्यौः, पन्थाः, सः, द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः See (I.

As अग्निः <i>agnih</i>, here <i>i</i> has the acute accent. The <i>udatta</i> is not marked in writing. The word 'vowel' of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood in this also. These accents are the qualities of letters, and are well known in the sacred and secular literature. The vowel which is perceived as having a high tone is called <i>udatta</i>. This tone depends upon the organ from which the vowel is pronounced. In the various organs, such as the throat, palate, &c., if a vowel is pronounced from a higher part of that organ, it is called <i>udatta</i>. The vowel in the pronouncing of which there is the restraining and checking of the bodily parts, and in which there is dryness and roughness of tone as well as a contraction of the larynx, is said to have the acute accent. The word is used in <i>sutra</i> (III. I. 3) \\[1\\] \"The first vowel of an affix has the <i>udatta</i> accent.\" As कृ + तव्यम् = कर्तव्यम् <i>kartavyam</i>.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - आद्युदात्तश्च ॥",

The vowel which is uttered from the lower portions of its special place of pronunciation gets the grave accent.\nThis word is used in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.4]] \\[1\\] \"the case terminations called सुप् and those affixes that have an indicatory प् are <i>anudatta</i>\" &c. As त्रयः, बोधयामि.\n\nIn pronouncing an <i>anudatta</i> vowel, there is slackening of the organs, and mildness, as well as softness and sweetness of tone: while there is expansion and widening of the larynx.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - अनुदात्तौ सुप्पितौ ॥",

    "12032": "It has been defined that <i>svarita</i> accent is a combination of <i>udatta</i> and <i>anudatta</i>. It remained doubtful what portion was acute and what grave. The present <i>sutra</i> clears up the difficulty, by declaring that in <i>svarita</i>, the first half is accute and the other grave.\n\nThe phrase <i>ardhahrasva</i> is used to indicate half the measure of a short vowel. Thus if a short vowel is <i>svarita</i>, its <i>matra</i> being one, half will be <i>udatta</i> and the other half <i>anudatta</i>. If a long vowel, whose <i>matras</i> are two, be <i>svarita</i> then 1\/2 will be <i>udatta</i>, 1 1\/2 will be <i>anudatta</i>. If a <i>pluta</i> (protracted) vowel be <i>svarita</i>, then first half measure will be <i>udatta</i>, and the remaining 2 1\/2measures will be <i>anudatta</i>. In short, the <i>udatta</i> portion of a <i>svarita</i> must not occupy more time than is taken in pronouncing a half short vowel. Thus in शि॒॒क्य॑म् <i>sikyam</i>, the <i>a</i> is <i>svarita</i>, half being acute, the other half grave or monotony; in क॒॒न्या॑ <i>kanya</i>, the long <i>a</i> is <i>svarita</i>, its first half measure is acute, the remaining 1 1\/2 is grave; in मानवका॑३ <i>manavaka</i>, here a prolated is <i>svarita</i>, its first 1\/2 is acute, the balance 2 1\/2 measure is grave.",

The <i>sutra</i> means: \"An accusative (द्वितीया) is compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत, पतित, गत, अत्यस्त, प्राप्त, and आपन्न and forms <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>\".

    "12046": "This further explains the use of the word <i>pratipadika</i>. \"Suffixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds. Those by which nouns are derived direct from roots, primary suffixes. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns, secondary suffixes. The former are called <i>Krit</i>, [[3.1.93]] \\[1\\], the latter <i>Taddhita</i> [[4.1.76]] \\[2\\]. Thus जन <i>jana</i>, man, is derived from the root जन् <i>jan</i> by the <i>krit</i> suffix अ; but जनीन <i>janina</i>, appropriate for man, is derived from जन <i>jana</i> by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix ईन <i>ina</i>. The name <i>pratipadika</i> would apply both to जन <i>jana</i> and जनीन <i>janina</i>, as nominal bases ready to receive the terminations of declension\" (Max Muller).\n\nOf the compounds, of which there are six varieties, we had occasion to refer to five already, viz. <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>, <i>Karmadharaya</i>, <i>Dvandva</i>, <i>Bahuvrihi</i> and <i>Avyayibhava</i>. They will be fully dealt with in their proper places.\n \nIn the last <i>sutra</i>, the words \"not ending in an affix\" were too extensive; this <i>sutra</i> makes an important provision in favour of words ending in <i>Krit</i> or <i>Taddhita</i> affixes. So also compounds are also called <i>pratipadika</i>. Being restricted to compounds only, it, of course, does not apply to sentences.\n\nThe words formed by <i>krit</i> affixes are <i>pratipadika</i>, as कृ (to do) + ण्वुल् = कृ + वु = कार् + अक = कारक. The affix ण्वुल् is a <i>krit</i> affix, and it is added to the root to form agent by Rule [[3.1.133]] \\[3\\]. The letters ण् and ल् are indicatory, the force of ण् being to cause the <i>vridhi</i> of the vowel of the root. The real affix वु is changed into अक by [[7.1.1]] \\[4\\]. the affixes यु and वु are replaced by अन and अक respectively. Thus the form कारक is a <i>pratipadika</i>, and is capable of declension by receiving case terminations, as कारकः ॥ Similarly कृ + तृच् [[3.1.133]] \\[5\\] = कर्तृ; nom. case कर्ता.\n\nThe word formed by <i>Taddhita</i> affixes are also <i>pratipadika</i>; उपगु + अण् = औपगो + अ = औपगव 'the son of the <i>Rishi</i> <i>Upagu</i>': nom. case औपगवः. Similarly कापटवः.\n\nIn fact in the chapters treating of these affixes, the derivative substantives formed by them are always shown by the Indian Grammarians in the nominative case singular number. The examples of nouns given in this book will be always declined nouns and not <i>pratipadikas</i>, except in peculiar cases. So also in the chapter of <i>samasa</i> or compounds.\n\nThe words ending in compound are <i>pratipadika</i>: as राज्ञः + पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, nom. case राजपुरुषः.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - कृदतिङ् ॥\n- [2] - तद्धिताः ॥\n- [3] - ण्वुल् तृ चौ ॥\n- [4] - युवोरनाकौ ॥\n- [5] - ण्वुल् तृ चौ ॥",
    "12047": "In the neuter gender, the <i>pratipadika</i> that would have ended in a long vowel, changes it into short. Thus अति + रै = अतिरि 'extravagant', as अतिरि = कुलम् 'an extravagant family'; अति लो = अतिलु 'very hairy', अतिलुं कुलं 'a very hairy family.'\n\nThere is no substitution of short vowel, if the noun is not in the neuter gender, as ग्राम + नी = ग्रामणी, nom case ग्रामणीः 'the leader of a village or head-borough.' Similarly सेनानीः 'the leader of an army.'\n\nA word may be in the neuter gender, but if it is not a <i>pratipadika</i>, the vowel is not shortened. As काण्डे तिष्ठतः 'two cantos remain.' Here the ए of काण्डे is formed by the coalescence of अ (of the <i>pratipadika</i> काण्ड) and इ (the dual case termination); thus काण्ड + इ = काण्डे. Now it might be urged that here one letter ए replaces two letters अ and इ. Therefore this substitute is equivalent to each of those letters separately, and consequently ए is the vowel of the <i>pratipadika</i> and ought to be shortened. But this is not to be so, because the word <i>pratipadika</i> has been especially mentioned in the text, and therefore this <i>ekadesa</i> is not treated as the final of the form which precedes it.",
    "12048": "The word <i>upasarjana</i> has been defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.43]]. In compounds the word गो becomes shortened when it stands last and is an <i>upasarjana</i>.\n\nThus चित्र + गो = चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.' This is an example of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> or possessive compound. So also शबलगु 'a spotted cow.' Similarly in those <i>pratipadika</i> <i>upasarjanas</i> which end in feminine suffixes having a final long vowel, there is a shortening. Thus निः + कौशाम्बी = निष्कौशाम्बिः. Here the final long ई is shortened. So also निर्वाराणसिः.\n\nThe word <i>pratipadika</i> of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood in this. The word गो in the <i>sutra</i> means the form गो and not other words synonym with it. The word स्त्री means \"a word ending in a feminine affix,\" because it has the <i>svarita</i> accent. The word <i>upasarjana</i> qualifies both these words, i. e. when गो is an <i>upasarjana</i> and when a word having a feminine termination is an <i>upasarjana</i>.\n\nOther examples are:- अति + खट्वा = अतिखट्वः 'without a bed-stead' अतिमालः 'surpassing a necklace in beauty.'\n\nIf such a word is not an <i>upasarjana</i>, there is no shortening, as, राजकुमारी 'the king's daughter.' Here the word राजन् is <i>upasarjana</i>, and not the word कुमारी which latter is therefore not shortened. The word must be a derivative word formed by the addition of an affix, which makes it feminine. Thus the words लक्ष्मी, श्री &c. are feminine originally, and are not derived from the masculine nouns, by the addition of any feminine affix. Therefore we have अतिलक्ष्मीः 'surpassing <i>Lakshmi</i> in beauty', अतिश्रीः ॥\n\nVart :- In <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds, exception must be made of feminine nouns ending in the affix ईयसी, as बहुश्रेयसी, विद्यमानश्रेयसी ।",
    "12049": "The word लुक् defined in <i>sutra</i> 61, Chapter I, is twice used in this <i>sutra</i>. Where a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided by the word लुक्, there the feminine suffix of the <i>pratipadika</i> is also dropped, or becomes <i>luk</i>. Thus there are certain <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes by which patronymics are formed (one of them being अण्) from other nouns. Before this अण् the initial vowel of the word is <i>vriddhied</i> and the final is <i>gunated</i>. Thus सिन्धु 'ocean', forms सिन्धु + अण् = सैन्धो + अ = सैन्धव 'born in ocean or oceanic.' But there are certain words, e. g. श्रविष्ठा, फल्गुणी &c., which are all feminine gender (see <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.34]] \\[1\\] after which the patronymic suffix is totally elided, without leaving any trace of its action, by using the word <i>luk</i>. Thus श्रविष्ठा + (अण्लुक्) = श्राविश्ठः ॥ Here then the present <i>sutra</i> finds its scope. The <i>Taddhita</i> suffix being <i>luked</i>; the original feminine termination आ also becomes <i>luk</i>. Therefore the 'patronymic derivative of श्रविष्ठा (is not a longer word, as might have been expected) but actually a shorter word, namely श्रविष्ठः; similarly from फल्गुनी if we have फल्गुनः &c.\n\nThus there is a feminine suffix called ङीष् (actually ई) and certain words like इन्द्र &c., [[4.1.49]] \\[2\\] take an additional suffix called आनुक् (actually आन्). Thus the feminine of इन्द्र will be इन्द्र + आनुक् + ङीष् = इन्द्र + आन् + ई = इन्द्राणी. Now in forming <i>Dvigu</i> compound (Numeral Determinative compound), the <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes are dropped. Thus पंचकपालः 'an offering (<i>purodash</i>) made in a dish with five compartments.' In this compound the <i>Taddhita</i> suffix अण् is dropped. Otherwise the form would have been कापालः ॥ Similarly when the word इन्द्राणी forms a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, the <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes are dropped. But not only that, even the original radical affixes are also dropped by force of the present <i>sutra</i>. Thus पंचेन्द्रः which means the cake sacred to the five goddesses इन्द्राणी. Here the full form was पंच + इन्द्राणी + अण्. (The suffix अण् has the force of \"sacred to God.\" Thus इन्द्र + अण् = ऐन्द्रं To sacred to God <i>Indra</i>). In the above expression, first the <i>Taddhita</i> suffix अण् is <i>luked</i> by rule contained in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.88]] \\[3\\] relating to <i>Dvigu</i> compounds: we have the remaining पंच + इन्द्राणी. In this stage, the present <i>sutra</i> comes into force and declares that where a <i>Taddhita</i> suffix has been <i>luked</i>, the final feminine suffixes of the <i>upasarjana</i> <i>pratipadika</i> are also <i>luked</i>. Therefore, the feminine suffixes आनुक् and ङीष् are also dropped, and we have पंचेन्द्रः which means \"cake sacred to the five <i>Indranis</i> (goddesses).\"\n\nThe word स्त्री and <i>upasarjana</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> are understood in this. By the last <i>sutra</i>, a word ending in a feminine affix was told to be shortened when it was an <i>upasarjana</i>; this <i>sutra</i> teaches the total suppression of such an affix in special cases. To take another example: Thus Rule [[4.3.163]] declares फलेलुक् \"<i>luk</i> takes the place of an affix signifying modification or product when fruit is meant.\" Thus यत् is an affix which means modification. Thus गो + यत् = गव्यम् 'cow's milk or the product of cow.' This affix is suppressed when applied to a tree, in the sense of the fruit of the tree. Thus the fruit of the tree आमलकी will be called आमलकं, i. e. first the <i>Taddhita</i> affix is <i>luked</i>, and then the feminine affix is also dropped. Similarly fruits of वदरी or बकुली trees are बदरं or बकुलं.\n\nThis rule only applies when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided; and not so when any other affix is <i>luked</i>. Thus गार्ग्याः + कुलं = गार्गीकुलम् 'the family of <i>Gargi</i>.' Here in forming the <i>samasa</i>, the case affix of the word <i>gargi</i> is <i>luked</i> by [[2.4.71]] \\[3\\]. But this suppression of the genitive termination does not necessitate the elision of the feminine affix ई of <i>gargi</i>.\n\nThis rule would not also apply if there is no elision by <i>luk</i> of a <i>Taddhita</i> affix, as in गार्गीत्वम्.\n\nNor will the rule apply when the word is not an <i>upasarjana</i>. As अवन्ती, कुन्ती, कुरूः.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - श्रविष्ठाफल्गुन्यनुराधास्वातितिष्य पुनर्वसुहस्तविशाखाषाढाबहुलाल्लुक् ॥\n- [2] - इन्द्रवरुणभवशर्वरुद्रमृडीहमारण्ययवयवनमातुलाचार्याणामानुक् ॥\n- [3] - द्विगोर्लुगनपत्ये ॥\n- [4] - सुपो धातुप्रातिपदिकयोः ॥",
    "12050": "By the former <i>sutra</i> when a <i>Taddhita</i> is elided, the long ई of the feminine also required elision. But this rule makes an exception in favor of the word गोणी३ in which, under similar circumstances the short इ replaces the long ई, as in the compound पंचगोणिः  'purchased for five <i>gonis</i>.' Here the <i>Taddhita</i> suffix which conveys the meaning of \"purchased for,\" has been rejected after गोणी by [[5.1.28]] \\[1\\]. Therefore by previous <i>sutra</i>, the feminine suffix  ई also required rejection. But this <i>sutra</i> intervenes and changes the long ई into short इ.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is divided into two separate rules by the process called <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>. Thus इत् is made one <i>sutra</i> by itself, and then it means, when there is a suppression of <i>Taddhita</i> aflix by लुक्, then the long ई is replaced by short इ. Thus purchased with five needles पंचभिः सूचीभिः क्रीतः = पंचसूचिः, दशसूचिः. This is restricted to such examples of purchase only.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - अध्यर्द्धपूर्वद्विगोर्लुगसंज्ञायाम् ॥",

Note the difference between the rejection of a <i>Taddhita</i> by saying 'let there be a लुक्' and 'let there be a लुप्' ॥ The direct action of both words is the rejection of the suffix; but a derivative formed by <i>luk</i> rejection may not retain the number and gender of the original word; while a derivative formed by <i>lup</i> rejection does retain the number and gender of the original word.\n\nThus in the secondary derivative word शिरीषाः, meaning 'a village not far away from शिरीष trees', the masculine gender and plural number of the original word has been retained, though made applicable to a village, which is in the singular number and neuter gender; similarly the word पंचालाः is masculine plural in form though applicable to a single province.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is not an approved rule; as will be mentioned by <i>Panini</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.53]] following and is consequently of little practical importance.\n\nThus पंचालाः are a class of <i>Kshatriyas</i>. As such it is masculine gender and plural number. The country in which <i>Panchalas</i> live is also called <i>Panchalas</i>; similarly कुरवः, मागधाः &c. There is a rule जनपदेलुप् ([[4.2.81]], the <i>lup</i> takes the place of an affix when signifying the proper name of a country or kingdom). Thus पंचालाः + अण् (this is one of the affixes forming country) = पंचालाः.\n\nThis rule does not apply when the affix is suppressed by the word लुक् &c. and not लुप्. Thus लवणः सूपः 'salted soup', लवणायवागुः 'salted gruel,' लवणं शाकं 'salted vegetable.' Here the affix उक् has been elided by the word <i>luk</i>, by [[4.4.24]]. लवणाल्लुक् (after the word <i>lavana</i> the affix is <i>luked</i>).\n\nThese derivatives retain only the gender and number of the original, but no other quality. Thus as we have already seen that शिरीषाः, <i>sirishah</i>, is the name of a village and is formed by the <i>lup</i> of the affix. Now compounding it with वन we have शिरीषवनम्, 'the forest of the village <i>Sirisha</i>.' Here the word शिरीषाः means village, and not trees. Had it meant trees called <i>sirisha</i>, then the न of वन would have become  ण optionally by Rule [[8.4.6]]. (विभाषौषधि वनस्पतिभ्यः ॥ The न of the word वन is optionally changed into ण when preceded by words signifying annual herbs and trees).\n\nVart:- In the case of the words <i>Haritaki</i> &c., the gender only is retained and not the number. As हरीतक्य फलानि 'the fruits of <i>Haritaki</i>. Here फलं is neuter in form, while हरीतकी is feminine.\n\nVart:- The words खलतिक &c. retain their number only but not gender, as खलतिकंवनानि 'mountain forests, i.e. forests in the vicinity of mountains.' Here खलतिकं is singular and वनानि plural, but the gender of both is the same viz. neuter.",
    "12052": "When a <i>Taddhita</i> is <i>luped</i>, the adjectives which qualify such secondary derivatives agree with them in number and gender. This is a rule of syntax. Thus पंचालाः रमणीयाः बह्वन्नाः, बहुक्षीरघृताः बहुमाल्यफलाः 'the pleasant <i>Panchalas</i> having plenty of food, plenty of milk and butter.' Here the adjective रमणीयाः, pleasant &c., agrees in number and gender with the <i>Panchalah</i>; being also in masculine plural. But when such a derivative is used as a <i>jati</i> word then the adjective does not agree in number and gender, as पंचालाः जनपदः, गोदौ ग्रामः. Here जनपद though qualifying <i>Panchala</i> does not agree with it in number and gender, as it is a noun of class. All attributes of such words formed by the <i>lup</i> of <i>Taddhita</i> agree with their substantives in number and gender: provided that such an attribute is not a common noun used as an adjective. Similarly adjectives which do not directly qualify such <i>Taddhita</i>-formed nouns, but do so through the medium of a noun of class, do not agree in gender and number with the <i>Taddhita</i>-word. Thus पंचालाः जनपदो रमणीयो बह्वन्नः, 'the country of <i>Panchalas</i> is pleasant and fertile.' Here the words रमणीयः and बह्वन्नः qualify directly the word 'जनपदः' and indirectly the word <i>Panchalas</i>, and therefore do not agree with the latter.\n\nThe explanation of this <i>sutra</i> as given by <i>Patanjali</i> in the <i>Mahabhashya</i> is somewhat different from that of the <i>Kasika</i>. The phrase चाजातेः is analysed by him as च and आजातेः, the sense being \"and as far as the <i>jati</i> goes.\" The word <i>jati</i> is thus explained :-\n\nA word expressing whatever is distinguishable by its form or figure, or which begins the name of an individual is easily found applicable to others without any further teaching, (a common name) provided it is not a word used in all genders, (common noun मुख्यजाति genus); and (only for the purpose of grammar as coming under the rules relating to the above mentioned words), a word expressing descendants by their parentage as well as a word expressing a person by the branch of the <i>Vedas</i> (शाखा) which the family to which the person belongs is competent to read शाखाध्येतृ (<i>sakhadhyetri</i>) (गौणजाति) = जातिवाचकाः (<i>jativachakah</i>) आकृति गृहणज्जातिर्लिंगानां च नसर्वभाक् ।  सकृदाख्यात निग्राह्य गोत्रं च चरणैः सह ॥\n\nThe following examples will illustrate the meaning of the above definition:-(1) तट is a <i>jati</i> word because it denotes what is distinguishable by its form, i. e. by its being contiguous to a place covered with water, (2) शूद्र is such a word, because when given as the name of an individual, is applicable to other <i>sudras</i> (common name), (3) औपगव is such a word, and (4) कठ a person belonging to the family competent to read the branch of the <i>Vedas</i> called <i>katha</i> is also such a word. But देवदत्त is not such a word, because it is a proper name applicable to only one individual and शुक्ल is likewise not such a word, because it, though a common name, is used in all genders.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of nouns formed by the लुप् elision of an affix relating to man. Thus the <i>Taddhita</i> affix कन् (क) is employed in denoting representation by imitation. Thus अश्वकः means a figure like a horse (in wood or clay or paper). But when the imitation is that of a man, this affix is elided. Thus चंचा means a \"doll of straw.\" But when we want to say a doll in the figure of a man, we will have चंचा + कन्लुप् (लुम्मनुष्ये [[5.3.98]]) = चञ्चा. Here this word is formed by the elision of an affix relating to man. Adjectives qualifying this word will not agree in gender and number. Thus चंचा अभिरूपः 'the delightful straw figure of man.' वध्रिकाः दर्शनीयः 'a beautiful representation of an eunuch.'",
    "12053": "The agreement between the number and gender of the nouns and attributes; of primary and secondary words formed by suffix rejection, is not an approved syntax. The gender and number of particular derivatives or adjectives are not blindly to be fixed by the primary words or the governed substantives; but it is a matter more or less of usage or idiom: and no hard and fast rule can be laid down for it. Thus the word दाराः 'wife' has the form of masculine plural, but is always applied to females, similarly आपः 'water' is always feminine plural in form, so also गृहाः वर्षाः सिकताः. This <i>sutra</i>, therefore, modifies the former <i>sutras</i> and leaves the whole question of syntactic agreement to be decided by usage and idiom.\n\nThe words like <i>Panchalas</i>, <i>Kaurava</i>, &c, should not be considered as derivative words formed by the <i>lup</i> elision of <i>Taddhita</i>; but they must be taken as proper nouns and appellatives of certain countries; consequently the gender and number of such words are fixed by the nature of such words and not by any rule of grammar.",
    "12054": "In explaining certain words, it is a round-about way of going to work to say that there was a suffix after them, which has been rejected, without producing any effect. It is easier to say that the form is what we find it to be, and that its peculiar meaning depends upon usage. Moreover, in many cases, the would-be etymological meaning is not in fact that the current meaning which the word has in ordinary language. It is therefore a useless circumlocution to presuppose the existence of a suffix, to add it to a word, and, then after all, to make it vanish.\n\nThus वरणाः <i>Varanah</i> is the name of a city. To say that it is derived from वरणाः a kind of tree, because the city is situated near such trees, and the trees gave the name to the city, is a cumbersome process. Because there might be no trees वरणा at all near the town <i>Varana</i>. Let us therefore call words like वरणा, पञ्चाला, &c., as simply proper nouns. Therefore there is no occasion for the application of the <i>Taddhita</i> affixes given in [[4.2.69]] and [[4.2.70]] (तस्य निवासः, अदूरभवञ्च) relating to residence and vicinity; much less of rules relating to '<i>lup</i>' elision contained in [[4.2.81]] and [[4.2.82]]. (जनपदेलुप्, वरणादिभ्यश्च).",
    "12055": "This <i>sutra</i> strengthens the former <i>sutra</i>. If it be said that a word always retains its etymological meaning in current language; then when there is an absence of such etymological meaning, then the word itself ought to vanish. But we know, as a matter of fact, that, there are words which have altogether lost their etymological sense, and connote a thing different from their radical meaning. Therefore to explain such words by <i>lup</i> elision of affixes is improper, because they do not retain the meaning of their primitive words.\n\nIt has already been said that words like पंचालाः &c. are not derivative words, &c. but are appellatives. If these words be taken as proving their etymological meaning, that is, as expressing or dependent upon, the sense of the original word, then when there is a loss of the original word signification, the secondary word must also cease to be employed. Thus if <i>Panchalas</i> be the name of the country in which the <i>Kshatryas</i> called <i>Panchalas</i> live, then when they cease to live in this country, it should cease to be called <i>Panchalas</i>. But we know, as a matter of fact, these words are now used without any reference to the people who once inhabited the countries. These words are consequently not derivative, but their sense is determined by usage. They are what may be called रूढि words.",
    "12056": "This <i>sutra</i> may be divided into two parts. The first part stating the proposition and ending with the word <i>vachanam</i>. The second part giving the reason. The first part consists of four words; <i>Pradhana</i>: 'Principal in a compound.' As in the compound राजपुरुषः 'king's man,' the word <i>raja</i> is <i>Upasarjana</i>; and पुरुषः is <i>pradhana</i>. 2. <i>Pratyaya</i>: 'affix.' 3. 'meaning.' 4. वचनम् 'word or sentence.'\n\nIn the time of <i>Panini</i>, there were some grammarians who held the opinion, that the meaning of a word is determined, if a compound word, then by its principal word; and if a derivative word, then by the suffix. <i>Panini</i> controverts this opinion by declaring that in as much as the meaning of a word is fixed by usage and idiom, therefore the proofs for the meaning of a word are not to be searched either in the affixes which go to form it; or by its principal word, if it is a compound. Because, says <i>Panini</i>, the proof of the meaning of a word is in something else, that is to say in the usage of a people and not in the suffixes, &c. A person who has never heard the name of grammar, understands full well when told to bring a <i>Raja</i>-<i>purusha</i>. He brings an official and not a king, nor even any person in general. Similarly when told to bring an औपगव he brings a cowherd's child, not a cowherd, nor a child in general, nor both. When, therefore, the sense of a word is determined by usage, there is no use to strive to find out the sense by grammatical rules.",
    "12057": "Here <i>Panini</i> controverts the opinion of those grammarians who would even define time and sequence. Thus there were authors who defined pluperfect as a tense relating to time hundred years past, others said a thousand years past, &c. <i>Panini</i> declares that these are redundant definitions and reprehensible, for the same reason as given in the previous <i>sutra</i>.\n\nTo give another example. Thus अद्यतनः कालः or the period of the current day, has been thus defined by some <i>Acharyas</i>:- \"The period of time beginning from the point when one rises (or ought to rise) from his bed, according to the law, and ending with the point when one goes to bed, according to rule, is called <i>adyatana</i>.\" Others say \"from midnight to midnight is the period of the current day.\" Similarly others have explained the '<i>upasarjana</i>' to mean \"that which is not the principal word in a compound is called <i>upasarjana</i>.\" The sage <i>Panini</i> has not thought it worth his while to define such word as <i>upasarjana</i>, in as much as their sense is well understood by all as a matter of usage. Thus common people who have never heard of grammar, also know the correct use of tenses; they say: \"This is to be done by me to-day, this wiil be done by us to-morrow, this was done by us yesterday.\"\n\nSimilarly common people also know the use of the word <i>upasarjana</i>, for they say:- \"वयमत्र गृहे ग्रामे वा उपसर्जनम्\" 'we are secondary or unimportant persons in this house or village,' meaning that they are not the principal persons. Therefore that which is valid according to the usage of the people is needless to be taught.\n\nWhy was not this <i>sutra</i> included in the last? What is the necessity of making a separate rule of this? The answer is that it is an illustrative <i>sutra</i>, and does not exhaust the subject. There are other rules made by former sages which are also not taught by <i>Panini</i>. Thus the following rules of old <i>Rishis</i> are not taught herein, they being supposed to be well-known. \"A <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound connotes ownership.\" \"In <i>Dvanda</i> compounds the sense of both the members of a compound are principal\" \"In <i>Avyayibhava</i> compounds the sense of the prior word is the principal\" &c.",
    "12058": "The words of this <i>sutra</i> require some detailed explanation. The name of a <i>jati</i> or species, always denotes one, since it is a collective noun, and will naturally take the singular number; by the present <i>sutra</i> such words may take the plural number also. In such nouns of class, the plural number has also the force of the singular. The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>asishyam</i> does not go further.\n\nIt follows from this that adjectives which are not themselves common noun, such as संपन्नः &c., agree with the noun and will also get the plural number. Thus संपन्नो यवः or संपन्ना यवाः; \"Full grown barley\" पूर्ववया ब्राह्मणः प्रत्युत्येयः or पूर्ववयसो ब्राह्मणाः प्रत्युत्येयाः ॥ Why have we used the word <i>jati</i> in this <i>sutra</i> ? For this aphorism does not apply to Proper Nouns. Thus देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i>, यज्ञदत्तः <i>Yajnadatta</i>.\n\nWhy have we used the word आख्यायाम्? A word may be a class noun or <i>jati</i>, but it may not be the appellation of a class. Thus the statue of <i>Kasyapa</i> may also be called <i>kasyapa</i>; this is a class noun; but as it is not the appellation आख्या or name of a class, such words cannot take the plural form and still denote a singular sense.\n\nWhy do we say '<i>ekasmin</i>'? When two or more class names are compounded as ब्रीहियवौ 'the rice and barley': the rule does not apply.\n\nVart:- An exception must be made when a class noun is qualified by a numeral adjective. As एको ब्रीहिः संपन्नः सुभिक्षं करोति.",
    "12059": "Thus \"I speak\" or \"we speak\" (अहं ब्रवीमि or वयं बुमः), may be spoken by one person; similarly two persons may either use the dual case or the plural case; thus आवां ब्रूवः 'we two speak' or वयं ब्रूमः 'we speak.'\n\nVart:- There is prohibition when the pronoun of the Ist person is qualified by an attribute :- as अहं देवदत्तो ब्रवीमि, 'I <i>Devadatta</i> am speaking.' अहं गार्ग्यो ब्रवीमि, 'I <i>Gargya</i> am saying.' Here we cannot use the plural.\n\nVart:- The word गुरु 'master' may have plural form though referring to one person, when following the word युष्मद्; as त्वं मे गुरुः or यूयं मे गुरवः, 'Thou art my master,' or 'you are my master.'",
    "12060": "The word च in this aphorism draws in the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वयः from the last. Of the stars <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i>, the forms may be either dual or plural. As उदिते पूर्वे फल्गुन्यौ (dual); or उदिताः पूर्वाः फल्गुन्यः (plural.) So also पूर्वे प्रोष्ठपदे or पूर्वाः प्रोष्ठपदः ॥  There are two pairs of stars of the name of <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i>, both being of feminine gender, and their logical number being 'dual.' The present <i>sutra</i> ordains plural optionally. If <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i> are not names of asterisms, they must have their proper number : as फल्गुन्यौ माणविके ॥",
    "12061": "In the Vedas, the star <i>punarvasu</i> which is always dual in form, may be in the singular form and connote a dual meaning. As पुनर्वसुर्नक्षत्रं or पुनर्वसू नक्षत्रमदितिर्देवता ॥ The option is only allowed in the Vedas and not in secular literature. In the latter it must be in the dual, that is, पुनर्वसू ॥ Similarly when it is not the appellation of an asterism but of a man, there is no option. As पुनर्वसू माणवकौ.",
    "12062": "The word विशाखा is in the dual number as a rule. In the Vedas, it is found sometime to have the singular form, denoting duality. Thus विशाखा नक्षत्रम् or विशाखे नक्षत्रमिन्द्राग्नी देवता ॥",
    "12063": "When there is a collective compounding of the words <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i> (meaning two groups of stars), the final compound is always in the dual. Thus उदितौ तिष्यपुनर्वसूदृश्येते 'the <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i> having risen are seen (dual).'\n\nThere is one star called <i>Tishya</i>; and there are two stars called <i>Punarvasu</i>. As the <i>Dvandva</i> compound of these stars refers to more than two stars, it ought to have been in the plural number. This rule teaches that there should be a dual number, where otherwise there would have been a plural number. Why do we say '<i>Tishya</i>' and '<i>Punarvasu</i>'? Observe विशाखानुराधाः 'the stars <i>Visakha</i> and <i>Anuradha</i>.' The compound is in plural number.\n\nThis rule would not apply if these words do not connote stars but are used in any other sense. As तिष्यपुनर्वसवो माणवकाः, 'Boys called <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasus</i>.'\n\nWhy is the word 'star' repeated in the <i>sutra</i>, when the previous <i>sutras</i> and the context show that stars were being treated of. The repetition is for the sake of including the synonyms of <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i>. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू; पुष्यपुनर्वसू, सिद्धपुनर्वसू ॥\n\nThe rule only applies when these words form a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, and not when they are compounded in any other way. Thus तिष्यपुनर्वसवः is an example of <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound meaning \"persons who confound the <i>Tishya</i> with the <i>Punarvasu</i>.\"\n\nThe rule only applies to the plural <i>Dvandva</i>. If the <i>Dvandva</i> takes the singular termination, this rule has no application. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू इदमिति.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>) that \"every <i>Dvandva</i> compound may optionally take the terminations of the singular\" for otherwise the employment of the term बहुवचनस्य in the <i>sutra</i> would be superfluous.\n\nThe word 'always' has been used in the text to show that the governing power of \"option\" stops here with this <i>sutra</i> and does not extend to it or any further.",
    "12064": "This is a very important <i>sutra</i>, and deals with what is technically called <i>Ekasesha</i> (or retention of one). When there are two or more words of the same form, and the same case termination, standing together, one is retained and the rest are dropped. Thus वृक्षः + वृक्षः = वृक्षौ (trees, in dual) वृक्षः + वृक्षः + वृक्षः = वृक्षाः.\n\nEvery individual thing requires an individual word to express it; one word therefore could not express many things; to prevent the repetition of the same word to express many objects of similar form, is the purpose of this <i>sutra</i>, by which one word is only retained.\n\nThis applies only to words having the same form and not if they have different forms; as प्लक्ष न्यग्रौधाः the <i>plaksha</i> and <i>nyagrodha</i> trees.\n\nThe word \"form\" is used in the text to show that even if two words have different meanings, but the same form, the rule of <i>Ekasesha</i> will apply, as अक्षः (die) + अक्ष (eye) + अक्षः (axle) = अक्षाः. Similarly पादाः and भाषाः.\n\nThe present rule only applies to the retention of one, and prevents the retention of two or more.\n\nThe word शेष (retention) is used to show that there is not a substitution (<i>adesa</i>) of one for many, but the retention of one out of many.\n \nThe rule will not apply if the two words are in different case-terminations, though they may have the same form. As पयः (1. s.) पयो (2. s.) जरयति ब्राह्मणाभ्यां (3 d.) च कृतं ब्राह्मणाभ्यां (4. d.) च देहि.",
    "12065": "The word <i>sesha</i> of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood here. The word \"<i>yuna</i>\" in the text is in the instrumental case. The <i>yuvan</i> word is dropped when read along with a <i>Vriddha</i> word. The word <i>Vriddha</i> means <i>gotra</i>: the old <i>acharyas</i> (grammarians) used the word <i>Vriddha</i> for <i>gotra</i>. The <i>vriddha</i> (or in other words, the gotra) word designates a person between whom and original head of the family a son (or a word formed by an <i>apatya</i> affix) intervenes. In using together two words, one formed by a <i>gotra</i> affix and the other by a <i>yuvan</i> affix, the <i>Vriddha</i> is retained, where the difference between those words is in their affixes only. These two words, <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i>, are defined in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.162]] and [[4.1.163]]. (अपत्यं पौत्रप्रभृति गोत्रम् ॥ जीवति तु वंश्ये युवा) ॥ Roughly speaking a <i>gotra</i> word is formed from the original noun which is the name of the head of the family when a son of such person is living; and a <i>vriddha</i> word represents thus a grandson, or lower than that, but not a son; while a <i>yuvan</i> word is derived from such last mentioned <i>gotra</i> word by another affix and thus represents persons lower than grandsons.\n\nThe word '<i>tad</i>' in the <i>sutra</i> refers to the <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i> affixes. The word <i>lakshana</i> 'sign' in the <i>sutra</i> is synonymous with 'cause' or 'occasion'; meaning the specific difference is caused or occasioned by the <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i> affixes. The word चेत् in the <i>sutra</i> means 'if.' The word एव 'only' is used to exclude others. The word विशेषः in the <i>sutra</i> means the 'dissimilarity of form.'\n\nThus गार्ग्यः + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here the first word denotes a clan called <i>Gargya</i> (the offspring or grandsons of <i>Garga</i> formed by the affix यञ् (IV. I. 105) \\[1\\] the second word denotes a younger branch of the same, and is formed by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix denoting a secondary derivative \\[2\\]. In this then, the first or \"<i>Vriddha</i>\" remains; the second or the <i>yuvan</i> is dropped; and the form \"<i>Gargyau</i>\" means both the old and the new clan. Similarly वात्स्यः + वात्स्यायनः = वात्स्यौ ॥\n\nThis <i>Ekasesha</i> is to be done only in those cases, where the two words have the same radical form, the only difference between them being in their derivative formation.\n\nThe words must differ only by their affixes, but their radical element must be the same. The rule therefore does not apply to:- गार्ग्यः (a <i>Vriddha</i> word + वात्स्यायनः (a <i>yuvan</i> word) = गार्ग्यवात्स्यायनौ ॥\n\nThis rule of <i>ekasesha</i> does not apply if one of the words be not a <i>Vriddha</i> word. Thus गर्गः + गार्ग्यायणः = गर्गगार्ग्यायणौ ॥\n\nSimilarly vice versa गार्ग्यः + गर्गः = गार्ग्यगर्गौ । Here the one word is <i>Vriddha</i>, but the other is not <i>yuvan</i>.\n\nThe word \"only\" is used in the <i>sutra</i> in an exclusive sense, the force being, that two words may stand in the relation of <i>Vriddha</i> and <i>yuvan</i>, their radical element, i.e. form may be the same; but if the secondary word has another sense over and above the sense of a <i>yuvan</i> affix, this rule is not applicable. Thus rule [[4.1.148]] \\[3\\] says a \"<i>Vriddha</i> word may optionally take the affix ठक् to form a <i>yuvan</i> word and to indicate contempt and born in the country of <i>Sauvira</i>.\" Thus भागवित्तिः + भागवित्तिकः = भागवित्तिभागवित्तिकौ. Here the second word, though a <i>yuvan</i> word, connotes the additional sense of contempt and degradation. The affix ठक् is not merely a <i>yuvan</i> affix but conveys the other sense also, the pure <i>yuvan</i> word being भागवित्तायनः.\n\nN. B.- The system of domestic economy among the ancient <i>Aryas</i> was considerably difterent from the prevalent one. The surnames or the <i>gotras</i> represented the patriarchal system. Three forms of surnames are constantly met with in ancient literature. The first was most important: it was the patronymic by which the lord of the united family, the patriarch, was known. For example, <i>Garga</i> or <i>Gargacharya</i> was the recognised head of all the <i>Gargas</i> who may be a hundred. His eldest son and heir was called <i>Gargi</i>. This is the first form of the patronymic (<i>apatya</i>). The grandsons or sons of <i>Gargi</i> were named <i>Gargyas</i> (<i>Vriddham</i> or <i>Gotra</i>). On the decease of the old patriarch, <i>Gargi</i> began to be called <i>Garga</i>; and the eldest of the grandsons was called <i>Gargi</i>; and those great-grandsons who belonged to the family, and were designated <i>Gargayanas</i> (<i>yuvan</i>) were now called <i>Gargyas</i>.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - गर्गादिभ्यो यञ् ॥\n- [2] - यञिञोश्च ॥\n- [3] — वृद्धाट्ठक्सौवीरेषु बहुलम् ॥",
    "12066": "When a word denoting <i>gotra</i> and in the feminine gender is compounded with another word denoting a <i>yuvan</i>, the first is retained and the last is dropped; and the feminine noun so remaining is then treated like the masculine. This aphorism makes an addition to the previous <i>sutra</i> and is governed by all the conditions mentioned in that <i>sutra</i>. Thus गर्गी + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here note that the resultant form is the same as in the former <i>sutra</i>, namely the masculine.\n\nSimilarly दाक्षी + दाक्षायणः = दाक्षी (masculine dual of दाक्षि).\n\nVart:- The word <i>stri</i> in the <i>sutra</i> means <i>Vriddha</i> <i>stri</i>, that is the eldest daughter of a grandson, or a further descendant considered as the female head of the family. The words '<i>tal</i> <i>lakshanas</i> <i>chedeva</i> <i>viseshah</i>' of the previous <i>sutra</i> govern this <i>sutra</i> also, i.e. the distinction between the two words must be in their formative element and not in any thing else.",
    "12067": "When two words of different genders differ only in their derivative elements but not in their radical elements, that is to say, one is masculine and the other feminine because of certain affixes, the masculine only is retained and the feminine is dropped.\n\nThe governing force of the words '<i>vriddha</i>' and '<i>yuvan</i>,' of <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]], does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>, but the remaining portion of <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]] is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. When a masculine word is read along with a feminine word, the feminine word is dropped and the masculine is retained, when the difference between the two words is caused only by the feminine and masculine affixes: as ब्राह्मणः + ब्राह्मणी = ब्राह्मणौ 'the <i>Brahmana</i> and the <i>Brahmani</i>'; कुक्कुटः + कुक्कुटी = कुक्कुटौ. 'the cock and hen.'\n\nBut not so in the following:- कुक्कुटः + मयूरी कुक्कुटमयूर्यौ 'the cock and the peahen.' Similarly गणकः + गणकी = गणकगणक्यौ. Here the feminine affix ङीष्, by which the word <i>ganaki</i> is formed from <i>ganaka</i>, in addition to its feminine signification, has the further signification given to it by Rule [[4.1.48]], पुंयोगादाख्ययाम्, meaning the \"wife of\" a <i>ganaka</i> and not a feminine <i>ganaka</i>; so also इन्द्रश्च इन्द्राणी चेन्द्रेन्द्राग्यौ ॥ Similarly आर्य्यः + आर्या = आर्यौ but आर्यः + आर्याणी = आर्यार्याण्यौ. Because the feminine affix in <i>aryani</i> conveys more than its feminine signification. See Rule [[4.1.49]].\n\nThis rule does not, of course, apply when it is not a masculine noun which is compounded, but it is a noun without any gender or neuter noun which is compounded with a feminine noun. Therefore प्राक् + प्राची = प्राक्प्राच्यौ. The word प्राक् is an indeclinable and is without any gender.",
    "12068": "With this <i>sutra</i> ceases the governing force of the remaining conditions contained in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]]. Even where the radical elements of two words are different there may be an <i>ekasesha</i> under special circumstances. Thus भ्रातृ + स्वसृ = भ्रातरौ (brother and sister or brothers). Similarly पुत्र + दुहितृ = पुत्रौ, (son and daughter or sons).\n\nN. B.- The practical application of this <i>sutra</i> is very neatly illustrated by the following example. There is a verse in <i>Yajyanvalkya</i> <i>smriti</i> पत्नी दुहितरश्श्चैव पितरौ भ्रातरस्तथा which declares that on the death of a sonless person his property passes to his wife, daughters, parents and <i>bhratarah</i>.\n\nHere the word <i>bhratarah</i>, if it be taken as simply the plural of <i>bhratri</i>, it means \"brothers\" and excludes sisters. But if it be interpreted according to this <i>sutra</i>, it means \"brothers and sisters\"; and thus gives sisters a right to inherit property of their brothers.",
    "12069": "A neuter prevails over a masculine or feminine noun when spoken of along with them, provided that the words differ in gender signs only; but radically they be the same. Thus आलस्यो मैथुनं निद्रा सेव्यमानं विवर्द्धते 'Idleness, lust, and sleep, indulged in, increase.' Here the adjective '<i>sevyyamanam</i>' is in the neuter gender, though it qualifies the words '<i>alasya</i>' which is in the masculine, '<i>maithunam</i>' which is in the neuter, and '<i>nidra</i>' which is in the feminine gender. The rule, therefore, may be stated in these words, that where one adjective qualifies several nouns, in different genders, but one of which must be neuter, the adjective agrees with the neuter.\n\nThe above illustration also shows that the neuter <i>ekasesha</i> may be in the singular number.\n\nIf the neuter is compounded with another neuter, this rule does not apply. Thus शुक्लं + शुक्लं + शुक्लं = शुक्लानि; the word is in the plural; there is no <i>ekavadbhava</i>.\n\nThe words तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषः of <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also: thus शुक्लश्च कम्बलः, शुक्ला च वृहतिका, शुक्लं च वस्त्रं. \"The white (masc.) blanket, the white (fem) wrapper, and the white (neut.) garment,\" may all he spoken of collectively as शुक्लं (neut.).",
    "12070": "Thus पिता + माता = पितरौ 'father and mother, or parents' or मातापितरौ. The verse quoted under <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.68]] illustrates this <i>sutra</i> also. There the word <i>pitarau</i>' has been explained by all commentators as \"father and mother.\" The word \"<i>ekavad</i>\" of the last <i>sutra</i> does not govern this <i>sutra</i>; though the <i>anuvritti</i> of 'optionally' is to be read into this.",
    "12071": "Thus श्वशुरः + श्वश्रू may be either श्वशुरौ 'father-in-law and mother in-law,' or श्वश्रश्वशुरौ ॥",
    "12072": "The list of '<i>tyadadi</i>' pronouns has been given under <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.27]]. They are 12 words beginning with '<i>tyad</i>' and ending with '<i>kim</i>;' when these <i>tyadadi</i> pronouns are compounded with any other noun, (or a pronoun, which does not belong to their class), they prevail, the rest are dropped. The word '<i>sarva</i>' is used in the aphorism to indicate 'universality'; i. e. what ever may be the word in composition with them, the '<i>tyad</i> &c.' are retained to the exclusion of others. The word '<i>nitya</i>' is used to indicate that this is an obligatory rule, and not optional, as were the last rules.\n\nThus सः (he) + देवदत्तः (<i>Devadatta</i>) = तौ (they two).\n\nVart:- When त्यदादि words are compounded among themselves, the word which is read last in the order given in the <i>Ganapatha</i> remains, the rest are dropped. Thus यः + सः = यौ; यः + कः = कौ ॥ Thus यद् is read after तद् (see [[1.1.27]]). So यद् will be retained and not तद्. Similarly किम् is read after यद्, and therefore किम् is retained to the exclusion of यद्.",
    "12073": "As a general rule, when there is a compounding of masculine and feminine nouns, the masculine noun is retained (see [[1.2.67]]). The present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to that rule. It ordains that when there is a compounding of words denoting group of domestic animals, of different genders, the feminine noun is preferred; provided that the words should not relate to the young of such animals. The word '<i>ataruna</i>' in the aphorism qualifies the word '<i>pasu</i>' with which it is in construction, and not the word '<i>sangha</i>.' As गाव इमाः 'these cows (and bulls);' अजा इमाः 'these goats' (both males and females).\n\nThe rule only applies to domestic (<i>gramya</i>) animals and not to wild animals; and only to beasts (<i>pasu</i>) and not men. As रुरव इमे, 'these wild deers' (male and female); पृषता इमे, 'these antelopes' (male and female); ब्राह्मणाः, 'the <i>Brahmanas</i> (male and female); क्षत्रियाः, 'the <i>Kshatriyas</i>.' In all these the masculine noun is retained by Rule [[1.2.67]].\n\nVart:- This rule must be confined to domestic animals having divided hoof. Therefore अश्वा इमे, 'these horses' (male and female). Here the masculine noun is retained, because horse has no divided hoof.\n\nWhy have we used the word (<i>sangha</i>) \"collection\"? Observe एतौ गावौ चरतः, 'these two cows are grazing.' Here the word '<i>gavau</i>' does not connote 'bull' also.\n\nWhy do we say \"not being young?\" वत्सा इमे 'these calves'; बर्करा इमे 'these kids.' Here the masculine noun is retained by the application of Rule [[1.2.67]].",
    "13001": "This defines the word <i>dhatu</i> or root. The list of Sanskrit verbs begins with the root <i>bhu</i> 'to be.' Sanskrit grammarians have divided all verbs into ten classes, according to certain modifications which their roots undergo before certain terminations. The ten classes are as follows:-\n\n1. <i>Bhu</i> class. 2. <i>Ad</i>. 3. <i>Hu</i>. 4. <i>Div</i>. 5. <i>Su</i>, 6. <i>Tud</i>. 7. <i>Rudh</i>. 8. <i>Tan</i>. 9. <i>Kri</i>. 10. <i>Chur</i>.\n\nThere are about two thousand verbs, and they are conjugated in two forms, some taking the <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations only, the others the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations and some both. The present chapter deals mostly with rules determining the nature of the verbal root, whether it is <i>Parasmaipadi</i> or <i>Atmanepadi</i> or both. A verb expresses action. The word <i>dhatu</i> is a word coined by older grammarians than <i>Panini</i> and they employed the term in denoting a word expressing action. Here also, therefore, the word <i>dhatu</i> means a word which expresses action.\n\nThe वा in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of auspiciousness; for the regular <i>sandhi</i> of भू + आदि is भ्वादि and not भूवादि; while Dr. Ballantyne considers that वा is a separate root : he translates the <i>sutra</i> thus:- \"Let the verbal roots <i>bhu</i> 'be,' <i>va</i> 'blow' and the like be called <i>dhatu</i>.\"",
    "13002": "<i>Anunasika</i> or nasalized vowels are इत् that is indicatory, when occurring in technical words. Thus in क्विन्, विद्, विच् the <i>anunasika</i> इ is इत्. The original <i>sutra</i> contains the word '<i>upadesa</i>' which we have translated as technical term. '<i>Upadesa</i>' literally means 'instruction' or the first mentioning of a thing either in a <i>sutrapatha</i>, or <i>ganapatha</i>, or <i>dhatu</i> <i>patha</i>, &c.\n\nFrom this <i>sutra</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.9]], there is a description of servile or indicatory letters called इत्. \"In <i>Panini</i>'s Grammar there is no visible sign of the nasality of a vowel -- hence we can know a vowel to be nasalized only from <i>Panini</i>'s explicitly asserting that it is so, or from our finding that he treats it in such a way that we must conclude he regarded it as nasal.\" An <i>upadesa</i> is defined as signifying an original enunciation, that is to say, an affix (<i>pratyaya</i>), or an augment (<i>agama</i>), or a verbal root (<i>dhatu</i>), or in short, any form of expression which occurs only in technical treatises of grammar, and which is not a word ready for use, but one of the supposed original elements of a word. Thus in the root एध 'to increase,' the final अ is indicatory, the real root is एध्. So also the final अ of स्पर्द्ध is इत् ॥\n\nIf the word is not an <i>upadesa</i>, then the nasal vowel is not इत् ॥ As अभ्र आं अपः ॥ A word may be an <i>upadesa</i>, and nasal, but if it is not a vowel, it need not be इत् as the affix मनिन् in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.74]]. (आतो मनिन् क्वनिब् वनिपश्च) It is only the nasal vowel of an <i>upadesa</i> that becomes इत् and not all the vowels. The word इत् occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[5.2.16]]. (आदितश्च &c.).",
    "13003": "All the final consonants of roots, affixes, &c., are indicatory. As in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>sutras</i> अ इ उ ण्; here ण् is इत् ॥ ऋ लृ क्; here क् is इत् ॥ ए ओड्; here ङ् is इत् ॥ ऐ औच्; here च् is इत् ॥ It is only in <i>upadesa</i>, that a final consonant is इत्. Not therefore, in अग्निचित् or सोमसुत्, which are complete words.",
    "13004": "This is an exception to the previous <i>sutra</i> which declared all final consonants to be इत्. In case terminations, the final त्, थ्, द्, ध्, न्, स्, and म्, are not इत्. Thus the case termination of nominative plural is जस्. Here the final स्, though a consonant is not an इत्; and is not rejected, as in ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The word तु in the <i>sutra</i> means the letters of the class त by virtue of <i>sutra</i> 69 Chapter I. (see <i>ante</i>). The word <i>vibhakti</i> will be defined later on in <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.104]]. These are terminations applied to nouns in declining them through various cases; and to verbs in conjugating them. Thus in <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.12]], (टाङसिङसामिनात्स्याः) the <i>vibhaktis</i> इन्, आत् and स्य replace टा, ङसि and ङस्. Here the final त् of the affix आत् is not indicatory and hence not rejected, as वृक्षात्. Similarly verbal terminations तस् and थस् as पचतः, पचथः ॥ So also the final म् as ताम् and तम् in अपचताम् and अपचतम् ॥\n\nThis exception applies only to <i>vibhaktis</i> and not to affixes in general. Thus the finals of यत् (III. 1. 97 अचोयत्;) युस् (V. 2. 123, ऊर्णाया युस्) and श्रम् (III. 1. 78 युधादिभ्य श्रम् ।) are इत् and are rejected. This exception, however, does not apply to the <i>vibhakti</i> अत् (in [[5.3.12]] किमोऽत् or [[3.4.106]], इटोऽत्). In those two <i>sutras</i> the final त् of the <i>vibhakti</i> is इत्. The reason of this is, that the present <i>sutra</i> is an <i>anitya</i> <i>sutra</i>, i. e. a rule not of general application. In <i>sutra</i> [[5.3.24]], (इदमस्थमुः) we find, 'the word इदम् takes the <i>vibhakti</i> थमु in the sense of mode or manner.' As इद् + थमु = इत्थम्, 'in this manner.' Now थमु is a <i>vibhakti</i> by [[5.3.1]]. (प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः), the उ is इत्, the real <i>vibhakti</i> is थम्. Now had the present <i>sutra</i> been of universal application, then there would have been no necessity of adding this उ as indicatory letter, which has been evidently added to save the म् of थम् from becoming an इत्. This <i>sutra</i> is consequently an <i>antiya</i> <i>sutra</i>.",
    "13005": "The syllables ञि, टु and डु, standing at the beginning of a root are indicatory; as ञिमिदा 'to have affectionate pleasure.' The real root is मिद्, the ञि is servile. So टुनदि 'to rejoice; be glad' the real root being नद्. So डुदाङ् 'to give' the real root being दा.\n\nThe ञि shows that the past participle क्त has the power of the present [[3.2.187]] (ञीतः क्तः). As ञिफला--फुल्लः 'blown'; ञिमिदा--भिन्नः; 'fat'; ञिधृषा—धृष्टः 'bold,' ञिक्ष्विदा—क्ष्विन्नः 'soft,' ञिइन्धी—इद्धः 'kindled.'\n\nThe टु subjoined to a root serves to show that it admits the affix अथु to form a noun indicative of the act [[3.3.89]] ट्वितोऽथुच्)); as टुवेपृः—वेपथुः 'shaking'; टु ओश्वि--श्वयथुः 'swelling.'\n\nThe डु indicates that the root to which it is subjoined admits of the affix त्रिम [[3.3.88]], ड्वितः क्त्रिः) to form a noun or adjective attributive of the act by which the substantive thing has been produced, as डुकृञ्—कृत्रिमम् 'artificial' डुपचष्—पक्त्रिमम् 'ripe'; डुवप्—उप्त्रिमम् 'sown.'\n\nIf these three syllables do not stand in the beginning of a verb, they are not indicatory; as पटूयति, कण्डूयति, &c.",
    "13006": "The initial ष् of an affix gets the name of इत् and is rejected. Thus by Rule [[3.1.145]] (शिल्पिनि ष्वुन्) the affix ष्वुन् is added to a verb to indicate proficient in the art expressed by the verb. The ष् and न् are इत् and अक् takes the place of वु (VII. I.1), युवोरनाकौ). Thus नृत् + ष्वुन् = नर्त् + अक् = नर्तकः 'a dancer' (by profession); fem. नर्तकी [[4.1.41]], षिद्गौरादिभ्यश्च 'words formed by affixes having an indicatory ष् take the affix ङीष् in the feminine'): so also रजकः, fem. रजकी.\n\nThe initial ष् of an affix only is इत् and not every initial ष्. Thus not in षोडः 'six,' or षडिकः ॥ The ष् must be initial, therefore it is not इत् in the affix टिषच् in अविमह्योष्टिषच्, (<i>Un</i> I. 45) as अविषः 'an ocean', महिषः 'a buffalo.'",
    "13007": "The consonants च्, छ्, ज्, झ्, ञ्, ट्, ठ्, ड्, ढ्, and ण्, are always इत् and are rejected when initial in affixes. The word 'affix' of the previous <i>sutra</i> governs this also.\n\nAs the affix च्फञ् <i>chapan</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.98]] गोत्रे कुञ्जादिभ्यश्चफञ्. Here च् is indicatory, as, कौञ्चायन्यः ॥ The initial छ् <i>chh</i> of an affix is always replaced by ईय [[7.1.2]] आयनेयीनीयियः फढ खच्छघां प्रत्ययादीनाम्). The initial ज् of an affix is इत्. As, जस् (Nom. Pl. term) ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The initial झ् of an affix is always replaced by अन्त, as भू + शप् + झि = भवन्ति ॥ [[7.1.3]] झोऽन्तः). The initial ञ् of an affix is इत् as in ञ्य which comes after the words शण्डिक &c. As शाण्डिक्यः [[4.3.92]] शण्डिकादिभ्योञ्यः). The indicatory ञ् causes <i>vriddhi</i> by rules [[7.2.115]], [[7.2.116]] and [[7.2.117]]: (अचोञ्णिति, अतउपधायाः, तद्धितेष्वचामादेः).\n\nThe initial ट् <i>t</i> of an affix is इत् as in [[3.2.16]] (चरेष्टः the root चर् takes the affix ट when compounded with a noun in the locative). As कुरुचरः 'who goes among the <i>Kurus</i>.' The feminines of words formed by this affix take ङीप् [[4.1.15]] टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज् &c.) As कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी. The initial ठ् of an affix is always replaced by इक [[7.3.50]] ठस्येकः). The initial ड् of an office is <i>it</i>, as in [[3.2.97]] (सप्तम्यां जनेडः the root जन् takes the affix ड when in composition with a word in the locative, as उपसरजः, मन्दुरजः. The ड् indicates that the final of the word called टि should be elided when an affix having indicatory <i>d</i> is added. The initial ढ् of an affix is replaced by एय (VII. 1. 2.)\n\nThe letter ण् is always an इत् when initial. As in the aphorism [[4.4.85]] (अन्नास्मः) the affix ण comes after the word अन्न 'food.' As अन्न + ण = आन्नः. The <i>n</i> causes <i>Vriddhi</i>.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> could very well have been included in the last aphorism. Why has it then been made a separate aphorism? The reply is that the present <i>sutra</i> declares an <i>anitya</i> rule--that is to say, a rule which is not universally true. The initial palatal or lingual of every affix is not indicatory. Thus in the affixes चुञ्चुप् and चणप् the initial च् is not indicatory but forms part of the real affix. As विद्याचुंचुः विद्याचणः 'famous for one's learning.' See <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.26]]. तेन वित्तश्चुञ्चुप् चणपौ. Similarly the initial ट of the affix टीटच् [[5.2.31]] अवात्कुटारच्च, नते नासिकायाः संज्ञायां टीटञ् नाटज्भ्रटचः), is not <i>it</i>. As अवटीटम् 'flat nosed.'\n\nOf course it is the initial palatal and lingual which are servile; if these letters occur in the middle of an affix, they will not be indicatory. As ठ of the affix अठच् is not indicatory in <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.35]] (कर्मणि घटोऽठच्) कर्मठः 'dexterous.'",
    "13008": "The initial ल्, श्, क्, ख्, ग्, घ्, ङ्, of affixes are indicatory, except in <i>Taddhita</i> affixes. Thus the initial ल् in ल्युट is इत् [[3.3.115]] ल्यट्च)। चि +ल्युट् = चयनम् (VII. I. 1) 'collecting.' The initial श् in शप् is इत् (III. 1. 68. कर्तरि शप्) भू + शप् + तिप् = भो + अ + ति = 'he is.' The initial क् is इत् as in क्त and क्तवतु (I. I. 26), as भुक्तः 'eating' भुक्तवान्. The initial ख् is इत् as in खच् [[3.2.38]] प्रियवशे वदः खच्) the word वद takes the affix <i>khach</i> when compounded with प्रिय and वश्) प्रियंवदः 'speaking kindly'. वशंवदः 'submissive.' The initial ग् is इत् as in the affix ग्स्नु (III 2. 139) ग्लाजिस्थश्च ग्स्नु), ग्लास्नुः 'languid', जिष्णुः 'victorious,' स्थास्नुः 'unmoveable.' The initial घ् is इत् as in घुरच् [[3.2.161]] भञ्जभासभिदो घुरच्) भञ्ज + घुरच् = भङ्गुरम् 'brittle.' The initial ङ् is इत्, as in ङसि (termination of the ablative sing.) ङस् ditto of genitive sing. [[4.1.2]], as सुमनस् + ङस् = सुमनस् + अस् = सुमनसः 'of a well minded.' In <i>Taddhitta</i> affixes however, these initials ल्, श् and gutturals are not इत्; and are therefore not elided. Thus चूडा + लच् = चूडालः (V. 2. 96.) प्राणिस्थादातो लजन्यतरस्याम्). 'crested'; लोम + श = लोमशः [[5.2.100]] लोमादिपामादिपिच्छादिभ्यः शनेलच्) 'hairy;' वृक्ष + कन् = वृक्षकः [[5.3.81]] - [[5.3.86]] जातिनाम्नः कन्) 'a small tree.'",
    "13009": "This <i>sutra</i> declares the function of इत्; namely it is a mere indicatory letter, and must be rejected. It is useful only as a mnemonic and is not a part of the term.\n\nThe word <i>tasya</i> in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the substitution of <i>lopa</i> must be in the place of the whole term called इत्, and not only in the place of the final letter, which last is the general rule (see. [[1.1.52]]). Therefore, the whole of ञि, टु  and डु is rejected and not only their finals.",
    "13010": "Thus <i>sutra</i> (III. I 134) (नन्दिग्रहिपचादिभ्यो ल्युणिन्यचः) declares- 'the affixes ल्यु, णिनि and अच् are applied to नन्दि, ग्रहि and पच् class of words.' It means the affix ल्यु is applied to the words of नन्दि class, the affix णिनि to words of ग्रहि class, and अच् to words of पच् class. The application must be respectively according to order, and not hap-hazard. Similarly in [[6.1.77]] इको यणचि (if a vowel follows) in the place of इ, उ, ऋ, लृ there is यण् i. e., य्, र्, ल्, व् ॥ So also see <i>Sutra</i>. [[4.3.94]] (तूदीशलातुरवर्मतीकूचवाराड् ढक् छण् ढञ् यकः) where the four affixes <i>dhak</i>, <i>chhan</i> <i>dhan</i>, and <i>yak</i> are applied respectively to the words <i>tudi</i>, <i>salatura</i>, <i>varmati</i> and <i>kuchavara</i>; i.e., the first affix in the order of enumeration to the first word, the second affix to the second word, &c. As तौदेयः, शालातुरीयः, वार्मतेयः and कौचवार्य्यः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of equal members'? This rule will not apply if the number of substitutes and of things for which these are to be substituted are unequal. As in <i>sutra</i> (1. 4. 90), लक्षणेत्थभूताख्यानभागवीप्सासु प्रति पर्यनवः for here the words <i>lakshana</i>, &c., in the first part of the <i>sutra</i> are four in number, while the words <i>prati</i> &c. are only three. That <i>sutra</i> therefore must be read as thus. \"The words प्रति, परि and अनु are <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i>, whenever they indicate either <i>lakshana</i> (a mark), <i>itthambhuta</i> <i>khyana</i> (a statement of mere circumstance); <i>bhaga</i> (division); or <i>vipsa</i> (desire).\"",
    "13011": "When in this collection of grammatical <i>sutras</i>, there is any <i>sutra</i> that has a circumflex accent, it denotes that it is either the beginning of a subject and the subsequent <i>sutras</i> are governed by it, or that it ends a subject and separates the previous <i>sutras</i> from the following.\n\nAs a rule, the <i>sutras</i> are not marked with accents; it is therefore from commentaries that one has to learn whether a <i>sutra</i> has a <i>svarita</i> or not. Thus the following <i>sutras</i> must evidently have <i>svarita</i> as they are governing <i>sutras</i>; प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1.) धातोः (III. I. 91), अङ्गस्य [[6.4.1]], भस्य [[6.4.129]].",
    "13012": "The word '<i>atmanepada</i>' here governs all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.77]] inclusive, and is understood in them all; and will not therefore be repeated. Thus of the verb आस the final अ is <i>anudatta</i> and is इत्. It is therefore an <i>atmanepadi</i> verb. As अस्ति. So षूङ्—सूते, शीङ् शेते.",
    "13013": "<i>Sutra</i> [[3.4.69]] declares the \"letter ल (लट्, लिट् &c.,) is placed after transitive verbs in denoting the object also as well as the agent; and after intransitives in marking the condition (i.e., the action itself which the verb imports) also as well as the agent.\" The <i>Paras</i>. and <i>Atman</i>. affixes would have come, therefore, generally after all these verbs. The present <i>sutra</i> restricts <i>Atman</i>. affixes to <i>bhava</i> and <i>karma</i> verbs.\n\nThis is clear. Impersonal verbs and passive verbs as a rule are conjugated in the <i>atmanepada</i> and take the terminations of that <i>pada</i>. These originally were verbs expressive of states rather than of actions. As of भाव we have ग्लायते भवता 'you dislike' (lit. 'it is disliked by you'), सुप्यते भवता 'you sleep.' Similarly passive verbs as क्रियते कटः 'the mat is made'; ह्रियते भारः 'the load is carried.'\n\nAll verbs in Sanskrit may have three voices, viz, active, passive, and middle or impersonal; active voice is generally <i>parasmaipada</i>. The reflexive verbs known as कर्मकर्तरि are also <i>atmanepadi</i>. Thus लूयते केदारः स्वयमेव 'the wood cuts of itself.' See <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.78]].",
    "13014": "The active or कर्तृवाच्य verbs when denoting reciprocal action are <i>atmanepadi</i>. As, व्यतिपचन्ते, 'they cook for each other,' व्यतिलुनते 'he performs cutting of wood which was the appropriate office of another.'\n\nThe words \"reciprocity or interchange of action\" of this <i>sutra</i> govern and are understood in the two following <i>sutras</i> also.\n\nThe word <i>karma</i> in the <i>sutra</i> means action and not the technical '<i>karma</i>' meaning 'object' and the word <i>vyatihara</i> means reciprocity or interchange. When an action which was appropriate to one person is performed by another, whose duty it was not, that is called 'interchange of action.' When such interchange is not meant <i>Paras</i>. is used. As लुनन्ति 'they cut.' The word <i>kartari</i> here is used for the sake of the subsequent aphorism [[1.3.78]], which see.",
    "13015": "This aphorism prohibits <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes in certain cases where by force of the last <i>sutra</i> <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes would have been obtained. As व्यतिगच्छन्ति 'they go against each other,' व्यतिहिंसन्ति 'they injure each other.' व्यतिघ्नन्ति 'they fight together.'\n\nThe word 'not' of this <i>sutra</i> is understood in the subsequent <i>sutra</i>.\n\nVart:- This prohibition extends to the verbs हस् 'to laugh,' and the rest. As व्यतिहसन्ति, व्यतिजल्पन्ति, व्यतिपठन्ति ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be made of the verbs हरति 'to injure,' as संप्रहरन्ते राजानः ॥",
    "13016": "Thus इतरेतरस्य व्यति लुनन्ति 'they cut each other' अन्योन्यस्य व्यतिलुनन्ति 'they cut one another.'\n\nVart:- This rule must also be applied when the word परस्पर is in composition with the verb, as an <i>upapada</i>. As परस्परस्य व्यतिलुनन्ति.",
    "13017": "As विशति 'he enters, but निविशते 'he enters in.'\n\nEven when the augment अट् of the imperfect, Aorist and Conditional tenses intervenes between the root and the preposition, terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>. As न्यविशत 'he entered in.'\n\nThe नि of the <i>sutra</i> must be an <i>upasarga</i>, because that has a sense, and not any नि. On this there is this <i>paribhasha</i>:-अर्थवद्ग्रहणेनानर्थकस्य \"a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning.\" Thus in मधुनि विशन्ति भ्रमराः 'the beetles enter the honey flowers.\" Here the नि is a part of the word मधुनि and has no sense by itself, and therefore the verb is in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> and not in the <i>Atmanepada</i>.",
    "13018": "The verb डुक्रीञ् 'to buy or barter,' has an indicatory ञ् and therefore, by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i>, therefore, refers to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe root क्री 'to buy' as a general rule takes the terminations of both <i>padas</i>, but when it is preceded by <i>pari</i>, <i>vi</i>, or <i>ava</i>, it is restricted to <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations. As प्ररीक्रीणीते 'he buys'; विक्रीणीते 'he sells'; अवक्रीणीते 'he buys.'\n\nThe word <i>pari</i>, <i>vi</i>, and <i>ava</i> must be <i>upasargas</i>, therefore, in the following example, there is no <i>Atmanepada</i> termination, because the <i>vi</i> there is not a preposition but a noun, as, बहुविक्रीणाति वनम्.",
    "13019": "As विजयते 'he conquers', पराजयते 'he conquers.' The words <i>vi</i> and <i>para</i> must be <i>upasargas</i> (prepositions), for the application of this rule. In the following examples, they are used as substaintives बहुविजयति वनम्, पराजयति सेना ॥",
    "13020": "The root दा is generally both <i>Parasmaipadi</i> and <i>Atmanepadi</i> (see <i>Sutra</i>. 72). But when preceded by the preposition आ, it is restriced to the <i>atmanepada</i> As विद्यामादत्ते 'he acquires knowledge.' But when it means \"to widen the mouth\" whether actually or metaphorically, it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As आस्यं व्याददाति. 'He expands his own mouth.'\n\nVart:- The prohibition also applies when the action is similar to the act of opening the mouth. As विपादिकां व्याददाति 'he opens the tumour.' कूलं व्याददाति नदी 'the river breaks the bank.'\n\nVart:- When the action does not affect the agents' own body the verb is <i>atmanepadi</i>, as व्याददतेपिपीलिकाः पतंगस्य मुखम्, 'the ants open the mouth of a locust.'",
    "13021": "The words \"आङ्\" is to be read into the <i>sutra</i> by virtue of the conjunction च in the text. As आक्रीडते संक्रीडते अनुक्रीडते, or परिक्रीडते 'he plays.'\n\nVart:- When the verb क्रीड् compounded with सम् means 'to make a rattling or creaking noise,' it does not take <i>atmanepada</i> terminations. As संक्रीडन्ति शकटानि 'the carts rattle or creak.' The word <i>anu</i>, <i>pari</i> &c., being taught along with <i>sam</i>, indicates that the <i>upasargas</i> <i>anu</i>, <i>pari</i>, &c., are to be taken and not the <i>karmapravachaniya</i> <i>anu</i> <i>pari</i>, &c. Therefore, when these prefixes are used as <i>karmapravachaniya</i>, they do not cause the verb क्रीड् to take the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations as माणवकमनुक्रीडति 'he plays in imitation of the boy.' For the definition and action of <i>karmapravachaniya</i>, see. [[1.4.83]] and [[2.3.8]].\n\nVart:- The verb आगम् takes the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations when meaning 'to wait for', 'to overlook', 'to have patience', as, आगमयस्व तावन् माणवकम् । 'Have patience with the boy.'\n\nVart:- The verb शिक्ष takes <i>atmanepada</i> terminations, when meaning 'to enquire':- as, विद्यासु शिक्षते 'he investigates sciences.'\n\nVart:- The verb नाथ् when meaning 'to bless,' takes <i>atmanepada</i> terminations, as, सर्पिषो नाथते 'he blesses with clarified butter.' मधुनो नाथते । Why do we say 'when meaning to bless'? Observe, माणवकमनुनाथति, 'he begs of <i>Manavaka</i>.'\n\nVart:- The verb हरति takes <i>atmanepada</i> terminations when meaning 'to take after the nature of the parents.' As पैतृकमश्वा अनुहरते 'the horses resemble their father.' मातृकं गावोऽनुहरन्ते 'the cows always imitate their mother.' But when not having this meaning, we have मातुरनुहरति 'he resembles his mother.'\n\nVart:- The verb किरति takes <i>atmanepada</i> terminations when meaning 'to scratch out or scatter with joy, for abode or food.' As अपस्किरते वृषभो हृष्टः 'the happy bull scratches with joy.' अपस्किरते कुक्कुटो भक्षार्थी 'the cock scratches in search of food,' अपस्किरते श्वाऽऽश्रयार्थी 'the dog scratches to make his abode.' When not having these senses we have अपकिरति कुसुमम् 'he scatters about the flowers.' The dental स in <i>apaskirate</i> is added by <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.142]]. अपाच्चतुष्पाच्छकुनिष्वालेखने ॥\n\nVart:- The verbs नु 'to cry' and प्रच्छ 'to ask' take the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations when preceded by the preposition आङ्, as आनुते शृगालः 'the jackal howls,' आपृच्छते गुरुम् 'he questions the <i>Guru</i>.'\n\nVart:- The verb शप् when meaning 'to touch the body by the word' takes <i>atmanepada</i> affixes. As देवदत्ताय शपते 'he promises by oath to <i>Devadatta</i>.' Otherwise we have शपति 'he curses.'",
    "13022": "As संतिष्ठते 'he stays with,' अवतिष्ठते 'he waits patiently,' प्रतिष्ठते 'he sets forth,' वितिष्ठते 'he stands apart.'\n\nVart:- The verb स्था when preceded by आङ् and meaning 'solemn declaration' takes <i>atmanepada</i> terminations; as अस्ति संस्कारमात्रमातिष्ठते ॥ Or to take another example, जलं विशं वा तव कारणादास्थास्ये 'for thee I shall surely have recourse to water or poison.'",
    "13023": "The word <i>prakasana</i> means disclosing one's intentions. The word <i>stheyakhya</i> is a compound of <i>stheya</i> 'arbitrator; and <i>akhya</i> 'name.'\n\nAs तिष्ठते जायापत्ये 'the wife expresses her wish to the husband;' त्वयितिष्ठते 'he refers to thee for settlement;' संशय्य कर्णादिषु तिष्ठते यः, 'who, when he is in doubt, has recourse to <i>Karna</i> as his judge or umpire.'",
    "13024": "The word '<i>karma</i>' in this aphorism means 'action,' and does not mean the grammatical <i>karma</i> or 'object.'\n\nAs गेहे उत्तिष्ठते 'he strives for the house' so also कुटुम्बे उत्तिष्ठते ॥ But आसनादुत्तिष्ठति 'he rises up from the seat.'\n\nVart:- The force of the preposition <i>ut</i> must be to express ईहा, 'effort, exertion, wish or desire, to surprise or excell.' If this be not the force of <i>ut</i>, the terminations are those of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As अस्माद् ग्रामात् शतमुत्तिष्ठति 'a hundred is yielded by this village.' The word ईहा qualifies the word '<i>anurdhakarmani</i>,' and does not debar the latter.",
    "13025": "As ऐन्द्र्यागार्हपत्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches with prayers or worships the <i>Garhapatya</i> fire with <i>aindra</i> hymns.'\n\nIf it does not mean 'praising with hymns' the terminations which the verb takes, are those of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, as भर्तारमुपतिष्ठति यौवनेन 'she approaches the husband through youth.'\n\nVart:- The verb स्था after the preposition उप takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when meaning 'worshipping a deity,' 'to approach for intercourse or uniting or joining,' 'to form friendship with,' and 'to lead to as a way.' Thus:- 1st <i>Deva</i> <i>puja</i> आदित्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he worships the <i>Aditya</i>.' 2. <i>Sangati</i> <i>karana</i> पतिमुपतिष्ठते नारी 'the wife approaches the husband,' रथिकानुपतिष्ठते 'forms union with charioteers.' 3. <i>Mitri</i> <i>karana</i> सन्तमुपतिष्ठते साधुः 'the good man approaches the saints to make friends with.' What is the difference between <i>Sangati</i>-<i>karana</i> and <i>Mitri</i>-<i>karana</i> ? <i>Sangati</i>-<i>karana</i> means drawing near and approaching together in space, as गंगायमुनामुपतिष्ठते 'the Ganges joins the <i>Jumna</i>.' While the friendly relations may be established without coming in physical contact. 4. <i>Patha</i> :- अयं पन्थाः स्रुघ्नमुपतिष्ठते 'this road leads to <i>Srughna</i>.'\n\nVart:- It must be stated that the <i>Atmanepada</i> is optional when the sense is 'desire of getting.' As भिक्षुको ब्राह्मणकुलमुपतिष्ठते or उपतिष्ठति 'a beggar waits at the place of a <i>Brahmana</i> with the desire of getting something.'",
    "13026": "As भोजनकाले उपतिष्ठते 'he stands ready at the time of dinner,' यावदभुक्तमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever it is dinner time,' यावदोदनमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever there is food, that is he comes at the time of dinner.' The word <i>bhukta</i> is formed by adding the affix <i>kta</i> to the root, and has the force of condition' here.\n\nThe phrase 'when used in the Intransitive' governs the three succeeding <i>sutras</i> also.\n\nIf it is transitive; the verb <i>upastha</i> takes the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. As राजानमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches the king.'",
    "13027": "As उत्तपते or वितपते विद्याया विद्यार्थी 'The scholar shines with knowledge.' But in transitive verbs, it is <i>Parasmaipadi</i>. As उत्तपति सुवर्णंसुवर्णकारः 'the goldsmith heats the gold,' वितपति पृष्ठं सविता 'the sun heats the back.'\n\nVart:- It must be stated that the terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>, though the verb <i>ut</i>-<i>tapa</i> or <i>vi</i>-<i>tapa</i> be transitive, when the object is some limb of one's own body. As उत्तपते पाणिम् or वितपते पाणिम् or पृष्ठम् 'he heats his own hand or back.' The word स्वाङ्ग means one's own body and not the <i>paribhashika</i> or the technical स्वाङ्ग meaning \"a thing which not being liquid or gaseous and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being and though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.\" (See (IV. 1. 54. स्वाङ्गाच्चोपसर्जनादसंयोगोपधात्). Therefore not so in the following देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य पृष्टमुत्तपति '<i>Devadatta</i> heats the back of <i>Yajnadatta</i>.' When the preposition is other than <i>ut</i> or <i>vi</i>, <i>parasmaipada</i> affix is employed; as, निष्टपति.",
    "13028": "The word intransitive of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.26]] is understood here also. Both these verbs are generally <i>parasmaipadi</i>. When they take the affix आ they become <i>atmanepadi</i>. <i>Yam</i> belongs to <i>Bhvadi</i> class; and <i>han</i> to <i>Adadi</i> class. Thus आ + यम् + शप् + ते = आ + यच्छ + अते [[7.3.77]] इषुगमियमां छः) '<i>chh</i> is the substitute of the finals of <i>ish, </i>gam<i> and </i>yam<i>, when an affix having an indicatory श् follows) = आयच्छते 'it spreads.' आयच्छेते and आयच्छन्ते; so also आ + हन् + ते = आ + ह + ते [[1.2.4]] and [[6.4.37]] अनुदात्तोपदेशवनतितनोत्यादीनामनुनासिकलोपो झलिक्ङिति = आहते, 'he strikes.' आ = हन् + आते = आ + हन् + आते [[1.2.4]] and [[6.4.98]] सार्वधातुकमपित् गमहनजनखनघसां लोपः क्ङि त्यनङि) = आघ्नाते [[7.3.54]], (हो हन्तेण्ञिन्नेषु) Pl. आघ्नते.\n\nNot so when these verbs are used in the transitive, as आयच्छति कूपाद्रज्जुम् 'he draws up the rope from the well,' आहन्ति वृषलं पादेन 'they kill the sinner with the foot.'\n\nVart:- When the object is some member of the agent's own body these verbs take the </i>Atmanepada<i> terminations though transitive. As आयच्छते पाणिम् 'he puts forth his own hand.' आहते शिरं 'he hurts his own head.' When the object is some limb of another's body, the terminations are of the </i>Parasmaipada_, as आहन्ति शिरः परकीयं 'they hurt others' head.'",
    "13029": "The above seven verbs when preceded by the preposition सम् and used in the intransitive, take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i>. As संगच्छते  [[7.3.77]] 'he joins,' समृच्छते 'he becomes hard or goes.' संपृच्छते 'he asks,' संस्वरते 'he blames,' समरन्त 'they are attained.' In the case of this last verb which belongs both to <i>Bhvadi</i> and <i>Juhutyadi</i> classes it is <i>Atmanepadi</i> only in the Aorist. As सम् + ऋ + अङ् + त [[3.1.56]] सर्तिशास्त्यर्त्तिभ्यश्च) = समृत, as मा समृत [[6.4.75]] बहुलंछन्दस्यमाङ्योगेऽपि) सम् + ऋ + अङ् + अन्त = समरन्त [[7.4.16]] ऋदृशौऽङिगुणः). This occurs generally in the Vedas. The verb विद् must have the meaning of 'to know,' and not that of 'to acquire.' संशृणुते 'he hears,' संवित्ते 'he knows.'\n\nVart:- The root दृश् (to see) after the preposition सम् when used intransitively takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> as संपश्यते 'he sees.' But when transitive, it takes <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations as ग्रामम् संपश्यति 'he sees the town.'",
    "13030": "The verb ह्वेः 'to call' whether transitive or intransitive is <i>Atmanepadi</i> after the above prepositions. The condition of being Intransitive does not apply to this <i>sutra</i>, and from this <i>sutra</i> forward general rules of <i>Atmanepada</i> are treated of. As निह्वयते, संह्वयते, उपह्वयते ॥\n\nThe verb ह्वे is marked in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with a ञ् and therefore, by <i>sutra</i> 72 of this Chapter, it will take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. But even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the verb <i>hve</i> takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when preceded by the above prefixes.\n\nVart:- The verbs अस् 'to throw' and ऊह 'to note' take optionally <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes when compounded with <i>upasargas</i>. As निरस्यति—०ते 'he casts out,' समूहति—०ते 'he collects.'",
    "13031": "As मल्लो मल्लामाह्वयते 'an athlete challenges another athlete (in order to conquer him)'; छात्रश्छात्रमाह्वयते 'one student emulates with another student.'\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is also for the purpose of showing that the root <i>hve</i> takes the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe word <i>spardha</i> means to emulate, to vie, to desire, to conquer another. When the verb <i>hve</i> has not the above signification, it takes the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As गामाह्वयति गोपालः 'the cowherd calls the cows.'",
    "13032": "The verb कृञ् by <i>sutra</i> 72 would take the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This <i>sutra</i> has been begun to show that this verb takes the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations under certain circumstances even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe word <i>gandhana</i> comes from the root <i>gandh</i> 'to injure,' of <i>churadi</i> class and means to inform against another maliciously with the object of injuring such person. <i>Avakshepana</i> means 'to revile', 'to over-come,' <i>sevana</i> means 'to obey and serve,' <i>sahasikya</i> means 'an act of violence,' <i>pratiyatna</i> means, 'imparting a new quality or virtue,' <i>prakathana</i> means 'to narrate fully,' <i>upayoga</i> means 'the disposal of a thing for the object of attaining &c.'\n\nThus उत्कुरुते, उदाकुरुते a means he informs against; (2) श्येनो वर्तिकामुदाकुरुते 'the hawk overcomes or reviles a snail,' (3) गणिकानुपकुरुते 'he serves the prostitutes,' महामात्राननुकुरुते 'he serves the <i>mahamatra</i>,' (4) परदारान् प्रकुरुते 'he outrages another's wife,' (5) एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the fuel gives a new quality (boils) to the water (or he prepares the wood and water for a sacrifice).' The object of the verb <i>kri</i> takes the affix of the sixth case i. e. genitive, only when the verb means <i>pratiyatna</i>, see <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.53]] (कृञः प्रतियत्ने) । Therefore <i>udakasya</i>, though an object, has genitive form. The verb takes the augment सुट् only when it is preceded by <i>upa</i> and signifies <i>pratiyatna</i>, see [[6.1.139]]. (उपात् प्रतियत्न वैकृत वाक्याध्याहारेषु) ॥ Therefore, there is the insertion of sibilant in <i>upaskurute</i>. (5) गाथाः प्रकुरुते 'he recites stories,' जनापवादान् प्रकुरुते 'he recites slander,' (6) शतं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a hundred pieces of money, for the sake of merit.' सहस्रं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say in these senses? Witness कटं करोति 'he makes a mat.' In this case the <i>atmanepada</i> affix is not employed.\n\nThe verb <i>kri</i> is understood in the three succeeding <i>sutras</i>.",
    "13033": "This <i>sutra</i> is commenced to show that <i>kri</i> may take the <i>atmanepada</i> affix even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word <i>prasahana</i> means 'to overcome, to be not defeated,' As तमधिचक्रे 'he overcame him or he was not defeated by him.'\n\nWhy do we say, 'in the sense of to overcome?' Witness अर्थमधिकरोति 'he learns the meaning' in which example the <i>atmanepada</i> affix is not employed.\n\nThe necessity of making a separate <i>sutra</i> of this rule, instead of including it in the last aphorism, arose with the object of giving a distinctive meaning to the prefix <i>adhi</i>.",
    "13034": "The word <i>karma</i> in the <i>sutra</i> indicates objective case or <i>karaka</i>; and does not express 'action,' as in some previous <i>sutras</i> such as [[1.3.24]] <i>ante</i>.\n\nAs क्रोष्टा विकुरुते स्वरान् 'the birds are making noise,' ध्वांक्षो विकुरुते स्वरान् ॥\n\nThe word वि governs the succeeding <i>sutra</i>.\n\nWhy do we say \"when governing a word expressive of sound in the objective case\"? Witness चित्तं विकरोति कामः 'love affects the mind.'",
    "13035": "As विकुर्व्वन्ते सैन्धवा 'the horses move gracefully,' ओदनस्य पूर्णाश्छात्रा विकुर्वंते 'the students being full of food are acting as they will or are aimlessly wandering about.'",
    "13036": "This <i>sutra</i> is begun in order to show that the verb नी may take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i>, even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, in the following cases, viz, when it means to 'respect' &c.\n\n<i>Sammanana</i> means to respect; as नयते चर्वी लोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> gives instruction in the <i>Lokayata</i> <i>sastra</i>.' The word <i>charvi</i> primarily means intelligence, and by secondary use it has been extended to the preceptor also; such a preceptor gives instruction, in <i>Lokayata</i> <i>Sastra</i>, that is to say, having established the truth of the doctrines of that philosophy by argumentation, imparts them to the pupils. Those doctrines being thus established by reason, become respected (<i>Sanmanita</i>) and honored.\n\n<i>Utsanjana</i>, 'to throw up, or lift up,' as माणवकमुदानयते 'he lifts up <i>Manavaka</i>.'\n\n<i>Acharya</i>-<i>karana</i> 'acting as a teacher,' that is to say, to bring a boy near oneself in such a way, that being so brought near (<i>upa</i>-<i>neta</i>), he may himself become an <i>acharya</i>, As माणवकमुपनयते 'he initiates <i>Manavaka</i> (i.e., making himself the preceptor he brings the boy near himself.')\n\n<i>Jnana</i> means 'knowledge, a demonstrated verity.' As नयते चर्वीलोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> investigates the truth of the <i>Lokayata</i> doctrine.'\n\n<i>Bhriti</i> means 'wages.' As कर्मकारानुपनयते 'he employs the servants on hire or wages.'\n\n<i>Viganana</i> means the paying off as a tribute, debts &c. As मद्रा करं विनयन्ते, the <i>Madras</i> pay the tax due to the king, that is, they discharge the debt.'\n\n<i>Vyaya</i> means 'allotment of money on works of merit &c.' As शतं विनयते 'he expends a hundred pieces on religious acts.' सहस्रं विनयते 'he devotes a thousand.\n\nWhy do we say, in these senses? Witness अजां नयति ग्रामम् 'he carries the goat to the village.' Here there is no <i>Atmanepada</i> affix, as the verb has not any one of the above significations.",
    "13037": "The verb नी is <i>Atmanepadi</i> when governing an object which has no material body, but is an abstract noun, that is an object which has abstract but no concrete existence; and when such an object has its seat in a portion of the agent of the verb. As क्रोधं विनयते 'he subdues his own anger,' मन्युं विनयते 'he suppresses anger.'\n\nThe word <i>sarira</i> means the body of living beings, any portion of such body is also called <i>sarira</i>.\n\nThe object must reside in the agent, (<i>kartristha</i>), otherwise the verb will be <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य क्रोधं विनयति '<i>Devadatta</i> removes <i>Yajnadatta</i>'s anger.'\n\nThe object moreover must be immaterial, otherwise the affix will be of <i>parasmaipada</i>. As गडुं विनयति 'he removes his own wort.' घाठां विनयति 'he bows his neck.'\n\nWhy do we say 'in the case of an object ?' Witness बुद्ध्या विनयति 'he is submissive through knowledge,' प्रज्ञया विनयति. Here the verb विनयति has not taken an accusative case, but is in construction with an instrumental case, and therefore the present rule does not apply.",
    "13038": "The word '<i>kram</i>' governs the succeeding <i>sutras</i> up to [[1.3.43]] and is understood in them all.\n\nThe verb <i>kram</i> by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.78]] (after the rest, let the <i>parasmaipada</i> affixes be employed in marking the agent), would have taken the affixes of the <i>parasmaipada</i>; the present aphorism enjoins <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes in certain cases when the verb means to have a taste for &c.\n\n<i>Vritti</i> 'continuity' means unobstructed, or want of interruption (i. e., a taste for, or facility in, anything), <i>sarga</i> 'energy' means application, resolution and determination. <i>Tayana</i> 'development' means increase and growth.\n\nAs (1) ऋक्ष्वस्य क्रमते बुद्धिः - 'his reason proceeds unobstructed through the <i>Rig</i>. scriptures i. e., he can easily comprehend the <i>Rig</i>.' (2). व्याकरणाध्ययनाय क्रमते 'the pupil shows energy or exerts to study the grammar.' (3). अस्मिनशास्त्राणि क्रमन्ते 'the <i>shastras</i> are developed in him.'\n\nWhy in these senses only? Witness अपक्रामति 'he runs away.'",
    "13039": "The words <i>vritti</i> &c., of the last <i>sutra</i> are understood here also. Why has this been made a separate <i>sutra</i> and not included in the last? The reason is to make a restrictive rule in the cases of <i>upasargas</i>; that is to say, only in the cases of the <i>upasargas</i> <i>upa</i> and <i>para</i>, there is <i>atmanepada</i> affix; but not so when any other <i>upasarga</i> precedes the verb <i>kram</i>, though the sense may be of continuity &c. Thus उपक्रमते 'he commences to advance,' पराक्रमते 'he marches to attack.'\n\nWhy do we say after the <i>upasargas</i> '<i>upa</i> and <i>para</i>'? Because, after any other preposition the affix will be of the <i>parasmaipada</i>; as संक्रामति 'he makes progress.' If the sense is not that of \"continuity\" &c., <i>parasmaipada</i> will be employed, as उपक्रामति, पराक्रामति.",
    "13040": "As आक्रमते सूर्यः 'the sun rises.' आक्रमते चन्द्रमाः 'the moon rises,' आक्रमन्त ज्योतींषि 'the stars rise.'\n\nVart:- This ascending must refer to heavenly bodies. Therefore in, आक्रामति धूमोहर्म्यतलात्, 'the smoke rises from the surface of the terrace,' the verb क्रम is <i>parasmaipadi</i>. Why do we say in the sense of \"to ascend\"? Witness आक्रमति माणवकः कुतपम् 'the boy assails the ox.'",
    "13041": "As वाजी विक्रमते 'the horse is pacing.' The term <i>vikramana</i> is applied to the special movements of horse &c.\n\nThough in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (catalogue of verbal roots), the verb क्रमि and क्रमु have the meanings of <i>pada</i>-<i>viharana</i> and <i>pada</i>-<i>vikshepa</i>, that is \"throwing or placing of foot,\" and so it might be objected that the present <i>sutra</i> is a useless repetition, yet as verbs have various other meanings than what is assigned to them in the <i>dhatupatha</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> is not unnecessary.\n\nWhy do we say \"in the sense of throwing of foot\"? In any other sense, the terminations will be those of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As विक्रामति अजिनसन्धिः 'the fold of the antilope skin is ruptured.'",
    "13042": "As प्रक्रमते भोक्तुम्, उपक्रमते भोक्तुम् 'he commences to eat' &c.\n\nThe prefixes <i>pra</i> and <i>upa</i> are synonyms, when they denote the commencement of an action.\n\nWhy do we say, \"when they are synonyms.\" Witness the following पूर्वेद्युः प्रक्रामति अपरेद्युरुपक्रामति 'he goes during the first part of the day and he comes back during the latter part of the day.' Here in one case the sense is \"to go,\" in another it means \"to return.\"\n\nWhy in the latter case of '<i>aparedyur</i> <i>upakramati</i>' there is not <i>Atmanepada</i> by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.39]] <i>ante</i>, as there is the <i>upasarga</i> <i>upa</i> here? The answer is that Rule [[1.3.39]] is not applicable, as that rule is limited by the condition of the sense of 'continuity' &c. while in the present <i>sutra</i>, that limitation is not applicable.",
    "13043": "The root '<i>kram</i>' may always be conjugated as <i>Atmanepadi</i> when not having any <i>upasarga</i>. The <i>upasarga</i> will be defined in [[1.4.59]]. The option allowed by this <i>sutra</i> is an example of what is technically known as <i>aprapta</i> <i>vibhasa</i> viz., an option which is not an alternative limitation to a general rule already found or known.\n\nExamples: क्रमते or क्रामति 'he goes over.' Why do we say 'when it is without any preposition ?' For no option is allowed when it takes preposition. As संक्रामति.",
    "13044": "The root <i>jna</i> which ordinarily means 'to know' and is <i>parasmaipadi</i> by rule [[1.3.78]], becomes <i>Atmanepadi</i> when through the virtue of any prefix it means 'to deceive:' as अपजानीते 'he deceives,' शतमपजानीते 'he denies the debt of a hundred rupees,' सहस्रमपजानीते 'denies a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say when meaning \"to deny ?\" Observe:- न त्वं किंचिदपि ज्ञानासि 'thou knowest not anything.'",
    "13045": "As सर्पिषो जानीते मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice by means of clarified butter or honey.' (See [[2.3.51]]).\n\nThis <i>Atmanepadi</i> form of <i>jna</i> is employed when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. From <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.76]] it will be seen that when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the verb is <i>Atmanepadi</i>.\n\nHow in the above example the verb <i>jna</i> is intransitive? Because the word <i>sarpih</i> is not the object of knowledge, but it is an instrument of sacrifice, into which one engages from complete knowledge (<i>jnana</i>); and it (<i>sarpishah</i>) is in the genitive case by virtue of [[2.3.51]] (ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे) by which the instrumental <i>karaka</i> of the <i>jna</i> is put in the genitive case.\n\nWhy do we say of \"Intransitive\"? Because in the transitive it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>, as स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he knows (recognizes) the son by his voice.'",
    "13046": "The word <i>jna</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>: and the aphorism applies to that <i>jna</i> which is used in the transitive. As शतं संजानीते 'he looks for a hundred,' So सहस्रं प्रतिजानीते 'he promises a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say when 'not meaning remembering with regret?' Because it is not <i>Atmanepadi</i>, when it conveys that meaning. Thus मातुः संजानाति 'he remembers with regret his mother,' पितुः संजानाति ॥",
    "13047": "By <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.78]], <i>vad</i> generally takes the terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. By the present <i>sutra</i>, it takes also the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when having certain meanings.\n\n<i>Bhasana</i>, (shining) means to illumine as वदते चर्वी लोकायते. The <i>charvi</i> illumines the <i>Lokayat</i> <i>shastras</i>, by his discourses and clear exposition.\n\n<i>Upasambhasha</i> (persuasions) means to appease, to conciliate, as कर्मकरानुपवदते 'he conciliates or cajoles the servants.'\n\n<i>jnana</i> (knowledge) means to know completely, as वदते चर्वी लोकायते 'the <i>charvi</i> knows completely to discourse upon <i>Lokayat</i> <i>shastra</i>.'\n\n<i>Yatna</i> (endeavour) means energy, as क्षेत्रे वदते 'He toils in the field,' गेहे वदते 'he toils in the house.'\n\n<i>Vimati</i> (disagreement) means dissension, want of unanimus opinion As क्षेत्रे विवदन्ते, 'they disagree over the field,' i.e., holding different opinions they talk diversely.\n\n<i>Upamantrana</i> (enticing) means to coax in secret, as, कुलभार्यामुपवदते 'he entices the wife of a respectable family (i.e., seduces her in secret),' परदारानुपवदते 'he flatters another's wife.'\n\nWhy in the above senses only? See यत् किंचिद्वदति 'he says something'.",
    "13048": "As संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः 'the <i>Brahmanas</i> are speaking.' But in संप्रवदन्ति कुक्कुटाः 'the cocks are crowing' it is properly <i>Parasmaipadi</i>.\n\nThe sense of the <i>sutra</i> is that when men, who are only capable of articulate speech, speak all in one and the same time, then the verb <i>vad</i> takes the affix of the <i>Atmanepada</i>. When lower animals make a chorus of noise, the verb does not take the <i>Atmanepada</i>\n\nThere must be <i>samuchcharana</i> for the application of this rule; when there is no <i>samuchcharana</i> or speaking in a chorus, this rule does not apply, as ब्राह्मणो वदति 'the <i>Brahmana</i> speaks.'",
    "13049": "As अनुवदते कठः कलापस्य <i>katha</i> is echoing or imitates <i>kalapa</i>. He reutters exactly what the <i>kalapa</i>-reader or the teacher says. The word <i>anu</i> here means similarly.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the Intransitive'? Because when it is used in the transitive it takes the affixes of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As पूर्वमेव यजुरुदितमनुवदति, 'he repeats the <i>yajurveda</i> which he had learned before.'\n\nThe words 'uttering of articulate speech' are understood here also. Otherwise अनुवदति वीणा 'the lute resounds,' here it is <i>Parasmaipada</i>.",
    "13050": "As विप्रवदन्ते or न्ति वैद्याः (the doctors are at variance). The words <i>vyaktavacham</i> (articulate utterance) and <i>samuchcharana</i> (speaking together) are understood in this <i>sutra</i> also.\n\nNo option is allowed when the sense is not that of contradiction or wrangling as, संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः, 'the <i>Brahmanas</i> are speaking together.'\n\nThe phrase 'articulate utterance' is necessary in this also. Because as विप्रवदन्ति शकुनयः 'the kites are quarrelling,' the verb is in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>.\n\nThe wrangling must be by talking at one and the same time, otherwise this rule will not apply. As क्रमेण वैद्या वैद्येन सह विप्रवदन्ति, 'the doctors contradict by turn another doctor.'",
    "13051": "As अवगिरति (he swallows). The root <i>gri</i> to swallow preceded by the preposition <i>ava</i> is <i>Atmanepadi</i>. The verb <i>gri</i> taken in this <i>sutra</i> means to swallow and belongs to the <i>Tudadi</i> class. It is not the <i>gri</i> 'to make sound' which belongs to the <i>kryadi</i> class, because there is no word formed with the latter verb by affixing the preposition <i>ava</i> to it. By <i>sutra</i> (I. .3. 78) this verb <i>gri</i> 'to swallow' would have been <i>Parasmaipadi</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> debars that.\n\nWhen it is not preceded by <i>ava</i>, it is <i>Parasmaipadi</i>, as गिरति 'he swallows.'",
    "13052": "As शनं संगिरते, 'he promises to pay a hundred rupees.' If it does not mean to promise or acknowledge, it takes <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. As संगिरति ग्रासम्, 'he swallows the mouthful.'",
    "13053": "As गेहमुच्चरते 'he strays away from home;' गुरुवचनमुच्चरते 'he transgresses the commands of his preceptor.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when used in the transitive\"? Observe बाष्पमुच्चरति 'the vapour is rising.' Here it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>.",
    "13054": "As अश्वेन संचरते 'he rides on the horse-back.'\n\nThe rule does not apply when it is not in composition with a word in the instrumental case. As उभौ लोकौ संचरति इमं चामुं च देवल ! <i>O</i> <i>Devala</i>! thou wanderest through both regions, this and that.' Here though the sense of the Instrumental case is implied, yet as it is not expressly stated, we use the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations.",
    "13055": "When is the 3rd case used with the force of the 4th case? That is answered by the following.\n\nVart:- The Instrumental has the force of the Dative when immoral conduct is implied. As दास्या or वृषल्या संप्रयच्छते 'he gives with the object of enticing to the female slave or prostitute.'\n\nThe verb <i>da</i> to give is generally <i>parasmaipadi</i>, it becomes <i>atmanepadi</i> under the above conditions.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the force of the dative case\"? Because when it has not the sense of the dative, <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations will be used, as पाणिना संप्रयच्छति, 'he gives with his hand.'\n\nIt might be asked how the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations are employed when the preposition <i>sam</i> is not directly applied to the verb, but another preposition <i>pra</i>, intervenes between <i>sam</i> and the verb. The reply is that the word <i>samah</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.54]] is not in the ablative case (which would have required its being placed immediately before the verb), but it is in the genitive case, and is used as an attribute.",
    "13056": "This is clear. As भार्यामुपयच्छते 'he espouses or knows his wife.' But not so when another's wife is meant; there it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>.\n\nBy rule [[1.3.78]], the verb <i>yam</i> would have been <i>parasmaipadi</i>, but the present <i>sutra</i> makes an exception, when the root takes the preposition <i>upa</i> and means \"to marry, to espouse, or to accept.\" The meaning of <i>sva</i>-<i>karana</i> is confined to accepting in general. This is according to <i>Kasika</i>; according to <i>Mahabhashya</i>, <i>sva</i>-<i>karana</i> means to make one's own what was not previously his own.\n\nWhy do we say in the sense of \"marrying\"? When it has any other sense, <i>parasmaipada</i> affixes will be employed, as देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य भार्यामुपयच्छति, <i>Devadatta</i> has illicit intercourse with the wife of <i>Yajnadatta</i>.'",
    "13057": "The above four roots are <i>atmanepadi</i> when in the Desiderative form, the suffix \"<i>san</i>\" being the <i>pratyaya</i> by which desideratives are formed.\n\nThe verb <i>jna</i> takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when used in the senses indicated by the three <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.44]], [[1.3.45]] and [[1.3.46]] already explained. The desiderative form of <i>jna</i> would ex necessitate take <i>atmanepada</i> affixes when used in the above senses: see Rule [[1.3.62]]. The present <i>sutra</i> however enlarges the scope of <i>atmanepada</i>, by declaring all desideratives of <i>jna</i> to be <i>atmanepada</i>, in whatever sense they may be used.\n\nSimilarly by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.29]] <i>ante</i> and the <i>vartika</i> under it, the roots <i>sru</i>, and <i>dris</i> take the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>; when preceded by <i>sam</i>, the desideratives of those would of course have taken <i>atmanepada</i> affixes by [[1.3.62]], but the present <i>sutra</i> makes it general.\n\nThe present <i>sutra</i> however enunciates a new rule in the case of the root <i>smri</i>.\n\nAs धर्म्मं जिज्ञासते 'he wishes to know (i. e. enquires after) religion,' गुरुं शुश्रूषते 'he serves the teacher,' नष्टं सुस्मूर्षते 'he wishes to remember the lost.' नृपं दिदृक्षते 'he wishes to see the king.'\n\nWhy do we say, when taking the affix <i>san</i>? Because the primitive verbs will take the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations as जानाति 'he knows,' शृणोति 'he hears,' स्मरति 'he remembers' पश्यति 'he sees.'",
    "13058": "This is an exception to the last <i>sutra</i>. The desiderative of <i>jna</i> with the prefix <i>anu</i> is not <i>atmanepadi</i>.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> read with <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.45]] limits the scope of <i>parasmaipada</i> to the transitive, desiderative verb <i>anu</i>-<i>jna</i>. As पुत्रमनुजिज्ञासति 'he enquires after the son.'\n\nWhy do we say when preceded by <i>anu</i>? Because otherwise it will take the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations. As धर्म्मम् जिज्ञासते 'he inquires after religion.'",
    "13059": "The verb <i>sru</i> when taking the prefixes <i>prati</i> and <i>an</i>, is not <i>atmanepadi</i>, though taking the desiderative \"<i>san</i>.\" This is also an exception to the rule of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.57]]. Thus प्रतिशुश्रूषति and आशुश्रूषति ॥\n\nThe word <i>prati</i> and <i>an</i> must be <i>upasargas</i>; if they are used as <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniyas</i> (see (1. 4.—83)) then the rule will not apply, as देवदत्तं प्रतिशुश्रूषते ॥",
    "13060": "The root '<i>sad</i>' when taking any affix which is marked with an indicatory श, is conjugated in the <i>atmanepadi</i>. In connection with this must be read <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.78]].पाघ्राध्मास्थाम्नादाण्दृश्यर्तिसर्तिशदसदांपिबजिघ्रधमतिष्ठमनयच्छपश्यर्च्छधौशीयसीदाः by which the root शद् is replaced by शीय before the affixes having an indicatory श. Thus शद् + श + ते = शीय + अते = शीयते 'he decays or withers,' शीयेते 'they two decay,' शीयन्ते 'they decay.'\n\nWhy do we say before affixes having an indicatory श? Before other affixes it is not <i>atmanepadi</i>. As अशत्स्यत् 'if he decayed,' शत्स्यति 'he will decay,' शिशत्सति.\n\nThe well-known <i>vikaranas</i> like शप्, श &c., the affixes like शतृ &c., are शित् affixes. In other words the root <i>sad</i> is <i>atmanepadi</i> in all conjugational tenses.",
    "13061": "This is a restrictive <i>sutra</i>, the root मृङ् (to die), is marked with a ङ् as an indicatory letter; so by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] it would be always <i>Atmanepadi</i>. But the present aphorism restricts it to लुङ् <i>lun</i> (Aorist) and लिङ <i>lin</i> (Benedictive) tenses as well as to those tenses which are शित्. It will be found hereafter that out of the ten tenses, those that take शित् affixes are the special tenses, i. e., the Present, the Imperfect, the Potential and the Imperative.\n\nIt is only before these three affixes, namely, <i>lin</i>, <i>lun</i>, and <i>sit</i> affixes, that the root <i>mri</i> takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus the aorist अमृत <i>amrita</i> he died; Benedictive मृषीष्ट <i>mrishishta</i> 'may he die.' Similarly before <i>sit</i> affixes : thus म्रियते 'he dies,' = भृ + श + ते [[7.4.28]] रिङ् शयग्लिङ् क्षु) म्रिय + अ + ते = म्रियते [[6.4.77]]. अचि श्नुधातुभ्रुंवां य्वोरियङुवङौ) म्रियेते, म्रियन्ते The root मृ belongs to the sixth class of verbs called <i>Tudadi</i> which take the <i>vikarana</i> श in the conjugational tenses [[3.1.77]].\n\nIn other tenses, viz., the two Futures, the Perfect and the conditional, this verb is <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As मरिष्यति he will die. अमरिष्यत्.",
    "13062": "If the primary verb is <i>parasmaipadi</i>, its desiderative will be also <i>parasmaipadi</i>; if the primary verb is <i>Atmanepadi</i>, its desiderative will be <i>Atmanepadi</i>. This is the general rule. Some exceptions to it have already been mentioned in <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.57]], [[1.3.58]], and [[1.3.59]]. A root which was <i>atmanepadi</i>, before taking the Desiderative affix सन् <i>san</i>, will be <i>atmanepadi</i> even when it takes the affix सन् <i>san</i>. In other words, that by reason of which the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes were ordained in the primary verb, will cause the same terminations to be applied when the verb ends in सन् <i>san</i>. Thus it was said in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]], that roots having an <i>anudatta</i> accented vowel as indicatory or a ङ् in as their indicatory letter take the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus आस्ते 'he sits down' and शेते 'he sleeps.' The verb आस् (to sit down) and शीङ् (to lie down) will remain <i>atmanepadi</i>, even when they are used as Desideratives. Thus असिसिषते 'he wishes to lie down.' Similarly <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.17]] declared that the verb निविश् is <i>atmanepadi</i>, as निविशते. This will be <i>atmanepadi</i> also in the Desiderative form, as निविविक्षते 'he wishes to enter.' So also by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.40]], आक्रमते is <i>atmanepadi</i>, the Desiderative आचिक्रंसते will also be <i>atmanepadi</i>.\n\nBut though by [[1.3.60]] and [[1.3.61]], शीयते and म्रियते are <i>atmanepadi</i>, yet शिशत्सति 'he wishes to lie down,' मुमूर्षति 'he wishes to die,' are <i>parasmaipadi</i>. Because the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes were ordained after the roots शद and मृङ् only under exceptional conditions and not generically, and as those conditions do not exist in the desiderative, the latter does not take <i>atmanepada</i> terminations.\n\nOf course that which in its primary state would not have taken the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>, there being a prohibition to that effect, will not allow them in its Desiderative form. As अनुचिकीर्षति 'he wishes to imitate.' पराचिकीर्षति. Here the root कृञ् by rule [[1.3.79]] has been especially declared to be <i>parasmaipadi</i>, to the exclusion of <i>atmanepada</i> affixes which would otherwise have come by Rules [[1.3.32]] and [[1.3.72]], and therefore its Desiderative is also <i>parasmaipadi</i>. The force of ञ् causing <i>atmanepada</i> is counteracted by [[1.3.79]].\n\nNow it might be asked :- True, this rule provides for those cases where a root is conjugated in two forms, one a Primitive and another a Desiderative conjugation. But what provision do you make for those partial verbs which take the affix सन् even in their primitive form; and in whose case we have no prior form to look upon as a guide in the application of <i>atmanepada</i> affixes. And there are at least 7 such quasi-roots which take सन् in this way, called also the self-descriptive सन्. Those quasi-roots are गुप्, तिज्, कित्, मात्, वध, दान्, and शान्. \"What are we to do with these quasi-roots, which are always conjugated with the affix सन् and have no simpler conjugation ?\" To this we reply; \"In the case of these partial verbs which take the self-descriptive सन् the <i>pada</i> will be regulated by the indicatory letters which these quasi-roots have.\" For though the full roots are जुगुप्स, तितिक्ष, चिकित्स, मीमान्स, बीभत्स, शीशन्स and दीदान्स, yet by the maxim अवयवे कृतं लिङ्गं समुदायस्य विशेषकं भवति, \"a sign made in a portion of a thing, qualifies the whole thing;\" the sign made in the expression गुप् &c., will qualify the whole verb जुगुप्स &c.\" Thus we have जुगुप्सते he despises, चिकित्सते he cures; मीमांसते he investigates, &c.",
    "13063": "This <i>sutra</i> applies where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. There are in Sanskrit two forms of the perfect tense (लिट्): one formed in the ordinary way by the reduplication of the root and adding the terminations; the other called the periphrastic perfect, is formed by adding आम् to the root, and then affixing to it the perfect tense of the roots कृ (to do), भू (to be ) or अस् ( to be ). These latter verbs are called <i>anuprayoga</i> or auxiliary verbs, as it is with their help that the perfect tense is formed. The question then arises, what conjugation, <i>parasmai</i> or <i>atmanepada</i>, do these auxiliaries take in forming the periphrastic perfect? This <i>sutra</i> supplies the answer :--the auxiliary कृ follows the conjugation of principals, the other auxiliaries do not. Thus the root एध (to increase, prosper) is <i>atmanepadi</i>, therefore in forming the periphrastic perfect, the verb कृ will be also in the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus एधांचक्रे (he prospered). Similarly इद् (to appear with great splendour) is <i>parasmaipadi</i> and the auxiliary कृ after it will be <i>parasmaipada</i>, as इन्दाञ्चकार (he appeared with great splendour).\n.\nBut the other auxiliaries भू and अस् retain their own peculiar conjugation and are not influenced by the conjugation of their principal. Thus एधाम्बभूव, एधामास.\n\nThe word <i>am</i>-<i>pratyaya</i> of the <i>sutra</i> means 'that after which the affix <i>am</i> (III. I. 35) and (III. I. 36.) (कास्प्रत्ययादाममन्त्रे लिटि) comes.' Of the verb <i>krin</i>, when subjoined to another as an auxiliary, the termination is that of the <i>atmanepada</i> like the verb that takes the affix <i>am</i>. If this <i>sutra</i> enjoined a rule of injunction (<i>vidhi</i>), then there would be the termination of the <i>atmanepada</i> even in examples like उदब्जांचकार and उदम्भांचकार where the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This is no valid objection to the present <i>sutra</i>. It is to be interpreted in both ways, that is, both as a <i>vidhi</i> (a general injunction) and a <i>niyama</i> (a restrictive injunction). How is that to be done? Because the word <i>purvavat</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read in the present aphorism also. The second explanation in that case will be for the sake of establishing a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule.\n\nIt has already been said above that the auxiliary verbs कृ, भू and अस् are used in forming the periphrastic perfect. This is done by force of the aphorism (III. I. 40), कृञ्चानुप्रयुज्यते लिटि, meaning, the verb <i>krin</i> is annexed in the perfect tense, to verbs, that take <i>am</i>. In this <i>sutra</i> (III. I. 40) the word <i>krin</i> is a <i>pratyahara</i>, implying the verbs कृङ्, भू and अस्. It might be asked how is this <i>pratyahara</i> formed? The word <i>kri</i> is taken from the fourth word of <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.50]], अभूतद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे &c., and the letter <i>n</i> is taken from <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.58]] कृञोद्वितीय &c. This is the way in which the commentators explain how not only the verb <i>krin</i> is used as an auxiliary in forming the periphrastic perfect, but also the verbs भू and अस्. These three verbs denoting absolute action unmodified by any especial condition have in all languages been fixed upon as the best auxiliaries.\n\nIt must, however, be noted that the word <i>krin</i> in this <i>sutra</i> is not used as a <i>pratyahara</i> and consequently does not include the verbs भू and अस्.",
    "13064": "The verb युजिर् 'to join' is <i>svaritet</i>, and consequently by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it is always <i>atmanepadi</i>, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i> declares when this verb may take the terminations of <i>atmanepada</i>, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. After the verb युज् preceded by the prepositions  प्र and उप the terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>, when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels. As प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he joins or employs'; उपयुङ्क्ते 'he fits or uses.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels?\" Because there the terminations will be of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As द्वन्द्वं न्यञ्चि पात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति.\n\nVartika:- It shall be rather stated that the root takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when preceded by any preposition beginning or ending with a vowel. This is an important modification of the above rule. Thus उद्युङ्क्ते and नियुङ्क्ते. In fact, all <i>upasargas</i>, with the exception of सम्, निर्, and दुर्, either begin or end with a vowel, and therefore the <i>Vartika</i> amounts to the inclusion of all prepositions with the above exception.\n\nWith सम्, निर् and दुर्, however, the root will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations; as संयुनक्ति.",
    "13065": "The verb क्ष्णु 'to sharpen, whet, or grind,' is generally <i>parasmaipadi</i>, but it is <i>atmanepadi</i>, when it is preceded by the prefix सम्; as संक्ष्णुते शस्त्रम् 'he whets the weapon', संक्ष्णुवाते 'they two whet', संक्ष्णुवते 'they all whet.'\n\nIt might be objected, why has a separate aphorism been made of the verb <i>kshnu</i>, when it could well have been included in the <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.29]] <i>ante</i>, which also speaks of the force of the prefix <i>sam</i>, when used with the verbs <i>gam</i>, <i>richchha</i>, &c. To this the answer is that, that <i>sutra</i> treats of intransitive verbs, the word <i>akarmaka</i> being understood therein, while the present <i>sutra</i>, as is evident from the example we have given above, treats of transitive verbs.",
    "13066": "The root <i>bhuj</i> when it does not mean to protect, is <i>atmanepadi</i>. This root belongs to the <i>rudhadi</i> class and has several meanings, as, to feed, to cherish, to preserve, to eat, and to enjoy. As भुंक्ते 'he eats or enjoys'; also <i>bhunjate</i>, <i>bhunjate</i> &c. But पुत्रान् भुनक्ति पिता 'the father cherishes the sons', भुनक्त्येनमग्निराहितः.\n\nThe root <i>bhuj</i> belongs also to the <i>tudadi</i> class, but there it has the sense of being curved or crooked. The <i>bhuj</i> belonging to the <i>tudadi</i> class is not to be taken in this <i>sutra</i>, because that <i>bhuj</i> has never the sense of protecting. Therefore बिभुजति पाणिम् 'he bends the hand,' is in the <i>parasmaipada</i>.",
    "13067": "The causatives (णिच्) are conjugated in the <i>atmanepadi</i>, when they are used in the passive voice, that is to say when a word which was an objective case in the ordinary verb becomes nominative case in the causative; and the nominative case of the ordinary verbs becomes objective case in the causative. In short when causatives are used in the passive voice, they are <i>atmanepadi</i>. This round-about phraseology has been employed, because the base of the active and the passive causatives do not differ in form; as आरोहते हस्तिपकान् हस्ती.\n\nThe phrase 'णेः (after the causatives)' of this <i>sutra</i> governs the four succeeding <i>sutras</i> and is understood in them. The <i>sutra</i> consists of the following words:- णेः 'after the causative;' अणौ 'in the non-causative;' यत् 'what;' कर्म 'object;' णौ 'in the causative;' चेत् 'if;' सः 'that;' कर्ता 'nominative;' अनाध्यान 'except to remember.'\n\nIn general, by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]], the causative verbs take the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i> applies to the case where fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nAfter the verbs that take the affix णिच्, the terminations are those of the <i>atmanepada</i>. How? When that which was the object when the primitive verb was used non-causatively, becomes also the object when the derivative verb is used causatively; and even that object becomes also the agent as well. There is exception, however, in the case when the verb means to 'remember with regret.' As आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant.' Let us paraphrase this sentence by transforming the primitive non-causative verb आरोहन्ति into a causative form. The sentence then will be, आरोहयते हस्ती स्वयमेव 'the elephant makes itself to be mounted.' Similarly उपसिंचन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers sprinkle the elephant'; and उपसेचयते हस्ती स्वयमेव 'the elephant makes itself to be sprinkled;' पश्यन्ति भृत्या राजानम् 'the attendants see the king'; and दर्शयते राजा स्वयमेव 'the king makes himself to be seen.'\n\nWhy do we say 'after the causatives?' Because the rule of this <i>sutra</i>, will not apply, if the verb though conveying the sense of a causal verb, is, however, not formed by the affix णिच्; as आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and आरोहयमाणो हस्ती साध्वारोहति 'the elephant that is being mounted, mounts gracefully'. Here the terminations are of the <i>parasmaipada</i> in the second case also.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the non-causative non-<i>ni</i>'? For this rule will not apply when the primitive verb itself is formed by the affix णिच्; such are the roots of the tenth class or <i>churadi</i> in which the <i>nich</i> is added in the self-descriptive sense, and not for a causative purpose. Thus the root गण belongs to <i>churadi</i> class; whose causative and primitive forms are the same. As गणयति गणं गोपालकः 'the cowherd counts the herd;' and the causative form is गणयति गणः स्वयमेव 'the herd makes itself to be counted.' The terminations in both cases are those of the <i>parasmaipada</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the object (<i>karma</i>) becomes the agent?' Because the rule will not apply, when any other <i>karaka</i> or case, than the <i>karma</i> or object, of the primitive verb becomes the agent in the causative. Thus लुनाति दात्रेण 'he cuts with the scythe,' लावयति दात्रं स्वयमेव 'the scythe is made to cut of itself.' Here the word <i>datra</i> was the instrument of the primitive verb which became agent in the causative, and therefore in the causative the terminations are of the <i>parasmaipada</i> only.\n\nWhy do we say 'if in the causative' in the <i>sutra</i>? It is for the purpose of indicating that the verb must be one and the same, both in the primary sentence and the causative sentence. Therefore the rule does not apply here where the causative verb सेचयति in the second sentence was not used in the first sentence; आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and आरोहयमाणो हस्तीभीतान् सेचयति मूत्रेण 'the elephant that is being caused to mount is made to sprinkle with urine the frightened men'.\n\nThe word सः 'that' is employed in the aphorism to show that the objects in both sentences must be the same and not different. Therefore in the following example where the objects are different, the terminations of <i>parasmaipada</i> are only used. आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant'; and आरोहयमाणो हस्ती स्थलमारोहयति मनुष्यान् 'the elephant, that is being caused to mount, makes men mount on the land.'\n\nWhy do we use the word <i>karta</i> (agent) in the <i>sutra</i> ? If the former object is not the agent in the second case, the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i> only would be used. As आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and तानारोहयति महामात्रः 'the elephant-driver makes it to mount.'\n\nWhy do we say 'except when meaning to remember with tenderness?' Observe, स्मरति वनगुल्मस्य कोकिलः 'the dove remembers, with regret, the forest tree;' and स्मरयत्वेनं वनगुल्मः स्वयमेव 'the forest tree is made to be remembered of itself.'",
    "13068": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is understood in this <i>sutra</i> and is to be supplied from the previous aphorism. This <i>sutra</i> is also restricted to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word हेतु in the aphorism has been defined later on in <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.55]] (स्वतन्त्र कर्त्ता); it is the agent which is the mover of another's agent. When a fear is caused by a हेतु it is called हेतुभय. The word भय 'fear' in the aphorism is illustrative, and includes by implication विस्मय 'astonishment' also. As जटिलो भीषयते 'the <i>jatila</i>, the cock-headed frightens.' मुण्डो भीषयते 'the <i>munda</i>, the shave-headed frightens '; जटिलो विस्मापयते 'the <i>jatila</i> astonishes,' मुण्डो विस्मापयते 'the <i>munda</i> astonishes' i.e., the very fact of matted-hair or shaven-head frightens,' &c.\n\nWhy do we say हेतुभय? For if the fear or astonishment is not the direct result caused by the agent, but arises from something else, then the <i>atmanepada</i> will not be used. As कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति 'he frightens him with the <i>kunchika</i>,' रूपेण विस्माययति 'he astonishes with his form'. Here <i>kunchika</i> and <i>rupa</i> are the instruments, which cause fear or astonishment, and are not the <i>hetu</i> thereof.",
    "13069": "The phrase 'of the causatives ending in णि' is to be supplied here from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. This <i>sutra</i> is also restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word प्रलम्भन of the <i>sutra</i> means deceiving. As मानवकं गर्धयते 'he deceives the boy,' मानवकं वञ्चयते 'he cheats the boy.'\n+\nWhy do we say 'when it means deceiving,' For these verbs have not this meaning, their causatives take <i>parasmaipada</i>. As श्वानं गर्धयति 'he causes the dog to bark,' अहिं वञ्चयति 'he avoids the serpent.'",
    "13070": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied here from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. This <i>sutra</i> has its scope only when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. In the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, there are two roots ली, one is technically called लीङ् and means to stick, and belongs to <i>divadi</i> class. The other ली meaning to 'melt' belongs to <i>kryadi</i> class. As there is no specification in the <i>sutra</i> what ली is to be taken, both are therefore taken.\n\nThe force of the word च in the <i>sutra</i> is to include the word प्रलम्भन 'to delude' of the last <i>sutra</i> into the present. The word संमानन means to show respect. The word शालीनीकरण means to subdue. As जठाभिरालापयते 'he gets respect or causes respect to be shown to him through or on account of his matted hair.' श्येनो वर्तिकामुल्लापयते 'the hawk subdues the partridge', कस्त्वामुल्लापयते 'who deceives thee.'\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> विभाषा लीयतेः [[6.1.51]] declares that the ई of ली is optionally changed into आं before certain terminations. But there is no option allowed when the root ली has any of the above three senses : in these cases the substitution of आ is necessary and not optional. For the option allowed by <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.51]] is a व्यवस्थितविभाषा and not a general विभाषा applicable everywhere.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it has the meaning of 'to show respect, &c.'? Because otherwise there is <i>parasmaipada</i>. As बालकमुल्लापयति.",
    "13071": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. The aphorism is restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word <i>abhyasa</i> means doing again, or repetition; as पदं मिथ्या कारयति means 'he repeatedly pronounces the word incorrectly, that is with wrong accent, &c., not once but constantly'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word <i>mithya</i> is used as an <i>upapada</i>?' The causative of <i>kri</i> will take <i>parasmaipada</i> when it has any other <i>upapada</i>. Thus पदं सुष्टुम् कारयति 'he pronounces the word correctly.'\n\nWhy do we say 'of the verb कृञ्? Because the causative of any other verb used along with the word <i>mithya</i> will not have <i>atmanepada</i>; as पदं मिथ्या वाचयति 'he repeatedly utters the word wrongly.' Here वच् takes <i>parasmaipada</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'repeatedly'? For if the incorrect utterance is not habitual, then <i>parasmaipada</i> will be used; as पदं मिथ्याकारयति 'he pronounces wrongly, not always but once.'",
    "13072": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrase णेः does not go further. The word क्रियाफलं is a compound, meaning 'fruit of the action.' When the principal object for the sake of which the action is begun, is meant for the agent indicated by the verb, there the <i>atmanepada</i> is used after verbs having an indicatory ञ or a <i>svarita</i> accent. As यजते 'he sacrifices for himself'; पचते 'he cooks for himself.' Here the verb यज् and पच् are marked with <i>svarita</i> accent in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, and therefore they take the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations.\n\nSimilarly सुनुते 'he presses the <i>soma</i>-juice,' कुरुते 'he does.' Here the verbs सुञ् and कृञ् have an indicatory ञ्.\n\nIn all the above cases, the principal object of the action such as getting heaven by performance of sacrifices, eating of food, &c., is meant for the agent. That is to say, he sacrifices in order that he himself may attain heaven, he cooks in order that he himself may eat, &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent'? Otherwise it will have <i>parasmaipada</i>. As यजन्ति याजकाः 'the priests sacrifice, (not for themselves, but for their clients)' पचन्ति पाचकाः 'the cooks cook (for their masters)'; कुर्वन्ति कर्मकराः 'the menials work (for their masters).' Here though the fees and the wages are the fruits which the agent gets, yet as that fruit is not the principal object for which the action was begun--the principal object of the sacrifice was not that the priest should get his fee, but that the sacrificer may go to heaven--the verb takes the terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. Here the principal fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, but to a third party.",
    "13073": "The phrase \"when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent,\" is understood here. The <i>sutra</i> is clear. As धनकामो न्यायमपवदते 'the wealth-seeker forsakes justice,' that is to say, he wishes to acquire wealth at the sacrifice of justice. But when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the <i>parasmaipada</i> is employed. As अपवदति.",
    "13074": "The phrase \"when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent\" is to be supplied from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. The verbs that take the affix णिच् <i>nich</i> are generally causatives. As कटं कारयते 'he causes the mat to be made for himself'; ओदनं पाचयते 'he causes the food to be cooked for himself.' When the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the <i>parasmaipada</i> is used. As कटं कारयति परस्य 'he causes another's mat to be made.'",
    "13075": "The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is read into this aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. As ब्रीहीन् संयच्छते 'he gathers rice'; भारमुद्यच्छते 'he lifts up the load'; वस्त्रमायच्छते 'he draws out the cloth.' The root <i>yam</i> preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> by virtue of aphorism [[1.3.28]] <i>ante</i>; but in that aphorism the verb was intransitive, here it is transitive, and this explains the necessity of making two different <i>sutras</i> for one compound verb आयम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not refer to a book.' For otherwise the verb will take the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः 'the physician diligently studies medicine.'\n\nWhen however the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the above compound verbs are <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As संयच्छति, उद्यच्छति, आयच्छति.",
    "13076": "The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also. Thus गां जानीते 'he recognises the cow as his own'; अश्वं जानीते 'he recognises the horse as his own.'\n\nWhy do we say when not preceded by any <i>upasarga</i> ? For when compounded with prepositions, it may take the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations; as स्वर्गं लोकं न प्रजानाति मूढः 'the fool does not know the heavenly regions.'\n\nWhen, however, the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the simple root ज्ञा takes <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. देवदत्तस्य गां जानाति 'he recognises <i>Devadatta</i>'s cow.'",
    "13077": "By the preceding five <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.72]] to [[1.3.76]], <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations were ordained to come after verbs which implied the accrual of the fruit of the action to the agent, that is to say, where the verb by itself denoted this. But when the same idea, instead of being inherent in the verb, is expressed by an <i>upapada</i>, that is by a word governed by the verb, the necessity of using the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes, to denote the same idea, is obviously removed, and in such a case it is optional whether we use the <i>Atmanepada</i> or the <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations. As स्वं यज्ञं यजति or यजते 'he sacrifices for his own <i>yajna</i>'; स्वं कटं करोति or कुरुते 'he makes his own cot.'; स्वं पुत्रमपवदति or अपवदते; स्वंमोदनं पाचवते or पाचयति, &c. So on with all the above five <i>sutras</i>.",
    "13078": "The rules of <i>Atmanepada</i> have been declared in the preceding 66 <i>sutras</i>, [[1.3.12]] to [[1.3.77]]. The terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, which are the general verbal terminations, will come everywhere else, that is to say, where its operation is not debarred by any one of the preceding aphorisms. The present <i>sutra</i> declares this universal rule. The word <i>sesha</i> or the rest, means that which is the residue after the application of all the previous restrictive rules. Thus it was declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] <i>ante</i> that a root having an <i>Anudatta</i> vowel or a ङ as <i>it</i>, will take <i>Atmanepada</i> termisations. As आस्ते शेते. The converse of this will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations, namely all verbs which do not have an <i>anudatta</i> accent or a ङ as <i>it</i>. Thus याति 'he goes,' वाति 'it blows.' It has been declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.17]] that the root विश when preceded by नि takes <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations, as निविशते. When not preceded by नि but any other preposition, it will take the <i>parasmaipada</i> termination. As आविशति, प्रविशति.\n\nWhy do we say \"when marking the agent\"? For when used in the passive voice the root will take the <i>Atmanepada</i> termination. As पच्यते 'it is cooked', गम्यते 'it is gone.'\n\nWhy is not <i>parasmaipada</i> used when the verb is employed reflexively ? As in the following example :- पच्यते ओदनः स्वयमेव 'the food cooks of itself.' Because in the present <i>sutra</i> the word कर्तरि of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.14]] <i>ante</i> is to be read in by <i>anuvritti</i>, so that, in fact there are two कर्तरि in this aphorism which thus means \"when the agent of the verb is an agent pure and simple then <i>parasmaipada</i> is employed.\" While when a verb is used reflexively (कर्म्मकर्तरि) the agent of the verb is also, in one aspect, the object of the verb; and it is therefore, that in reflexive verbs the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations are employed.",
    "13079": "By aphorism [[1.3.32]] <i>ante</i>, the root कृ took the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the sense denoted was that of \"divulging, reviling,\" &c., and it also took <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]], because the root कृञ् has an indicatory ञ. The present <i>sutra</i> makes an exception to those rules, and ordains <i>parasmaipada</i>. Thus अनुकरोति 'he imitates,' पराकरोति 'he does well.'",
    "13080": "The root क्षिप् to throw, is <i>svariteta</i> therefore by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] <i>ante</i>, it would have taken <i>Atmanepada</i> termination, when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent; this aphorism ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As अभिक्षिपति 'he throws on,' प्रतिक्षिपति 'he turns away or rejects,' अतिक्षिपति 'he throws beyond.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when coming after <i>abhi</i>, <i>prati</i>, and <i>ati</i>'? Because when compounded with any other preposition, it will not take <i>parasmaipada</i>, but will be governed by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. As आक्षिपते 'he throws down.'\n\nThe second कर्तृ of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.14]] is also understood here, so that when the verb is used reflexively, the agent not being purely an agent, the present <i>sutra</i> will not apply. As अभिक्षिप्यते स्वयमेव 'it is thrown on of itself.'",
    "13081": "The root वह to carry is <i>svaritet</i>, and by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it would have taken the <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. But the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As प्रवहति 'it flows.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when coming after <i>pra</i>\"? Because after any other preposition it will not take <i>parasmaipada</i>, as आवहते 'he brings.'",
    "13082": "The root मृष \"to suffer\" is <i>svaritet</i>, and by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it would have taken <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As परमृष्यति 'he endures or he becomes angry.' When not preceded by this preposition, it takes <i>Atmanepada</i> termination. As आमृष्यते.\n\nAccording to some authors, the root वह of the last aphorism is said to be understood in this, so that वह preceded by परि will also take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations; as परिवहति",
    "13083": "The verb रम् means 'to sport.' It is <i>anudattet</i> and therefore by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] it would have taken <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations; the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead, as विरमति 'he takes rest'; आरमति 'he delights in,' परिरमति 'he sports.'\n\nWith other prepositions than these, it will take <i>atmanepada</i> termination. As अभिरमते",
    "13084": "As देवदत्तमुपरमति 'he causes <i>Devadatta</i> to refrain.' The sense of the verb <i>uparamati</i> is causative here, as if it was उपरमयति. This is an example of a verb involving in it the force of the causative affix णिच्.\n\nIt might be asked why was not the preposition उप read along with the other preposition in the last aphorism, instead of making this a separate <i>sutra</i>. The answer is that the necessity of making a separate <i>sutra</i> with the preposition <i>upa</i> arose from the exigencies of <i>sutra</i> making. It is desired, that the next <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.85]] should apply only to the root <i>upa</i>-<i>ram</i>, and not to other compounds of <i>ram</i>; and this could only be done by making these two distinct _sutras.",
    "13085": "The last aphorism ordained <i>parasmaipada</i> absolutely. This declares an option under certain circumstances. As यावद्भुक्तमुपरमति or उपरमते, he desisted from or was quiet while it was eaten.",
    "13086": "By <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]] <i>ante</i>, causatives took the <i>atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This makes an exception to that and ordains <i>parasmaipada</i>. As बोधयति he expands ; योधयति he causes to fight; नाशयति he causes destruction, जनयति he begets, अध्यापयति he teaches; प्रावयति he causes to obtain; द्रावयति he causes to melt; श्रावयति he causes to trickle.\n\nOf the above eight roots, those which are intransitive would have taken the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations under the conditions mentioned in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.88]] sub, that is to say, when the agent is a being endowed with reason. The present aphorism in the case of such intransitive verbs makes this additional statement, that those intransitive verbs will take <i>parasmaipada</i>, even when the agent is not a being endowed with reason. As बोधयति पद्मम् he makes the lotus to expand, योधयति काष्ठानि he makes the woods to strike each other, नाशयति दुःखम् he destroys sorrow, जनयति सुखम् he produces pleasure.\n\nAgain of the above eight roots, those that have ordinarily the sense of \"moving\" will get <i>parasmaipada</i> by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.87]]. The present <i>sutra</i>, in their case makes this additional statement, that they will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations even when the sense is not that of moving. Thus प्रु means both 'to move' and 'to obtain,' द्रु means 'to run' as well as 'to melt,' and स्रु means 'to flow' as well as to 'to trickle.' As प्रवते he obtains; अयोद्रवति the iron melts; कुण्डिका स्रवति the water-vessel drips. The examples in the first paragraph have therefore been thus translated.\n\nThe root इङ् is always compounded with अधि.",
    "13087": "The phrase 'when used in the causative (णेः) of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this also. The <i>parasmaipada</i> is ordained as an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]] by which <i>atmanepada</i> was ordained when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. The word निगरणं means 'eating,' and चलनं means 'moving,' 'shaking.' As निगारयति he causes to swallow; आशयति he causes to eat; भोजयति he feasts; चलयति he moves; चोपयति, कम्पयति he shakens. This aphorism applies to transitive verbs, and to verbs whose agents in non-causative state are inanimate objects, i. e. not possessed with reason.\n\nVart:- The prohibition of the root अद to eat, must be mentioned. The causative of अद to eat, takes <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus अत्ति देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i> eats; आदयते देवदत्तेन he is made to eat by <i>Devadatta</i>.",
    "13088": "The phrase णेः is understood here also. The <i>Atmanepada</i> was ordained by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]] when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This aphorism is an exception to that, and ordains <i>parasmaipada</i>. As आस्ते देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i> sits; आसयते देवदत्तं he makes <i>Devadatta</i> to sit; शेते देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i> sleeps ; शाययति देवदत्तं he causes <i>Devadatta</i> to lie down.\n\nWhy do we say 'in its non-causal state'? For if the causative root is from another causative root, and not from a simple non-causative root, then the <i>parasmaipada</i> will not be employed. Thus 'if one person such as <i>Devadatta</i>, causes another person <i>Yajnadatta</i>, to cause a third person <i>Ramadatta</i>, to do an act denoted by an intransitive root, as 'mounting' for instance, though <i>Ramadatta</i> mounts for his own benefit, the verb to be used in such a case is आरोहयते, in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, from the root  आरुह to mount; and not आरोहयति. (<i>Lengar</i>'s Guide to <i>Panini</i>).\n\nWhy do we say 'which was intransitive'? This rule will not apply if the verb in its non-causative state was transitive. Thus from कारि the causative from कृ, if the person caused to do the act denoted by the verb does it for his own use, comes only कारयते though the person has a will; for the original root कृ though a non-causative root, is not an intransitive root.' (Ibid).\n\nWhy do we say 'having a being endowed with reason for its agent'? For if the agent is a non-sentient object, the verb will be <i>Atmanepadi</i>. Thus from शोषि the causative from शुष 'to dry' if that which dries is a thing not possessed of a will as व्रीहयः 'paddy,' for instance, though the fruit of the action, i.e., the drying, affects only the paddy itself, comes शोषयते in the <i>atmanepadi</i>, though 'to dry' is an intransitive root; e. g., शोषयते व्रीहीनातपः 'the sun-shine causes the paddy to dry.' (Ibid).",
    "13089": "The last two aphorisms had ordained <i>parasmaipada</i> instead of <i>Atmanepada</i>, even when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent, thus debarring the latter's action which would otherwise have taken place by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]]. This <i>sutra</i> prohibits the last two <i>sutras</i>, and re-instates <i>Atmanepada</i> of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]]. Thus root पा to drink, has the sense of <i>nigarana</i> or swallowing, the roots दम &c., have sentient beings as their agent; the root नृत् to dance has the sense of चलन or moving, but still these verbs have <i>atmanepada</i> affixes, and do not take <i>parasmaipada</i> in the causative. As पाययते he causes to drink, दमयते he causes to be tame, आयामयते he lengthens, आयासयते he troubles, परिमोहयते he entices, रोचयते he makes agreeable, नर्त्तयते he causes to dance, वादयते he makes to speak, वासयते he causes to dwell.\n\nVart:- The root धेट is should be enumerated along with पा &c. Thus धापयेते शिशुमेक समीची. The doe suckles a young infant.",
    "13090": "The affix क्यष is ordained by <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.12]] भृशादिभ्यो भूव्यच् वेर्लोपश्च हलः after the words लोहित &c. These roots take optionally <i>parasmaipada</i>. As लोहितायति or ते he reddens. पटपटायति or ते he makes <i>pat</i> <i>pat</i>.",
    "13091": "The <i>Dyutadi</i> verbs are 22 in number, to be found in <i>Dhatupatha</i> in the <i>Bhuadi</i> class. By the use of the word द्युद्भ्यः in the plural in the <i>sutra</i>, the force is that of &c. These verbs are <i>anudatta</i> and so by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] they would have been invariably <i>atmanepadi</i>, this aphorism makes them optionally so in the aorist. Thus अद्युतत् or अद्योतिष्ठ he shone. In other tenses than the aorist (लुङ्) these verbs are invariably <i>Atmanepadi</i>. As द्योतते he shines.\n\nFor a list of <i>Dyutadi</i> verbs see <i>Dhatupatha</i>.",
    "13092": "The वृतादि verbs are five in number and are included in the द्युतादि sub-class. They are वृत् to be, वृध् to grow, शृधू to fart or break wind; स्यन्दु to ooze, and कृपु to be able. As Ist Future वर्त्स्यति or वर्त्तिष्यते, it will be; conditional अवर्त्स्यत् or अवर्तिष्यत्; Desiderative विवृत्सति or विवर्त्तिषते &c.\n\nIn other tenses than the above, they are always <i>Atmanepadi</i>. As वर्त्तते it is.",
    "13093": "The verb क्लप् is one of the five verbs of the sub-class वृतादि of the last aphorism. Therefore it will take both <i>parasmaipada</i> and <i>Atmanepada</i>, when the affixes स्य or सन follow. The present <i>sutra</i> makes the additional declaration in the case of Ist Future or लुट. Thus in <i>Lut</i> we have-- कल्प्तसि or कल्प्तासे thou wilt be; in Ist Future we have :- कल्पिष्यते or कल्प्स्यति he will be; in the Desiderative we have :- चिक्लृप्सति or चिकल्पिषते; in the conditional we have :- अकल्प्स्यत् or अकाल्पष्यत.",
    "14001": "What is that name then? That which comes last, where the claims are otherwise equal (I. 4. 2.) and that which were its claim disallowed, would have no other opportunity of conducing to any result, would be the recognised name. As a short vowel is called 'light' by (I. 4. 10.) and it is also called 'heavy' when it precedes a conjunct consonant [[1.4.11]]. Thus a short vowel has two names 'light' and 'heavy.' But it will not be called 'light' when it precedes a conjunct consonant, but will have only one name, i.e. 'heavy.' Thus in भिद to divide छिद to split, the इ is 'light' while the same letter is 'heavy' in शिक्षा teaching भिक्षा begging.\n\nThus in the root तक्ष् the अ is 'heavy' and therefore in forming its aorist we have the form अततक्षत्. Similarly अररक्षत्. The rule [[7.4.93]] not applying here as that rule is applicable to <i>laghu</i> vowels only.",
    "14002": "The word विप्रतिषेधे means 'opposition of rules of equal force.' When two topics having different objects in view find scope of action simultaneously in one particular case, that opposition of equal forces is called <i>vipratishedha</i>. A general rule (<i>utsarga</i>) and its exception (<i>upavada</i>), or an invariable (<i>nitya</i>) and an optional (<i>anitya</i>) rule, or an <i>antaranga</i> and a <i>bahiranga</i> rule, are not rules of equal force. There the stronger prevails against the weaker. As an example of rules of equal force, see (VII. 3.102.) and [[7.3.103]]. The first rule declares, 'when a case-affix beginning with a letter of <i>yan</i> <i>pratyahara</i> follows, the long vowel is substituted for the final of an inflective base ending in a short अ.' As <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>bhyam</i> = <i>Vrikshabhyam</i>. The next rule declares :- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or <i>jhal</i> <i>pratyahara</i> follows, ए is the substitute for the final short अ of an inflective base.' As <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>su</i> = <i>Vriksheshu</i>. But when the plural case-affix <i>bhyah</i> follows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter <i>bha</i> belongs both to the <i>pratyaharas</i> <i>yan</i> and <i>jhal</i>. Are we to lengthen the short अ, or substitute ए? The present <i>sutra</i> gives the reply, ए is to be substituted because [[7.3.103]] ordaining ए follows next to [[7.3.102]]. Thus <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>bhyah</i> = <i>Vrikshebyah</i>.",
    "14003": "The word यू is compound of ई + ऊ The word <i>stryakhya</i> means that which by itself denotes the name of a female. These words must be always feminine, having no masculine of the same form, as the word <i>gramani</i> has. As the words <i>Kumari</i> a virgin, यवागू, <i>yavaguh</i> rice gruel. The declension of nouns of <i>nadi</i> class is somewhat peculiar which will be treated of later. As see Rule [[7.3.112]] आट् is the augment of the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ when they come after a word ending with a <i>Nadi</i>.\n\nWhy do we say ending in ई and ऊ ? Because feminine nouns not ending in these vowels will not be declined like <i>Nadi</i> words. Thus while the dative of कुमारी will be कुमार्य्यै, the dative of दुहितृ will be दुहित्रे.\n\nWhy do we say 'which are feminine'? Because if they are names of males, they will not be called <i>Nadi</i>. As ग्रामणीः leader of a village; सेनानी leader of an army; खलपू a sweeper; their dative being ग्रामण्ये, सेनान्ये, खलप्ये.\n\nWhy have we used the word <i>akhya</i> 'name' in the text? Because feminine gender must be denoted by the word itself and not by any other epithet used along with the word. Thus if the head-borough or the sweeper should be of the female sex, the Dative Singular would still be ग्रामण्ये स्त्रियै and खलप्वे स्त्रियै.",
    "14004": "The definition of <i>Nadi</i> given in the last <i>sutra</i> was rather too wide, this limits the scope. Thus श्री, happiness, भ्रू brow, admit the substitutes <i>iyan</i> and <i>uvan</i> respectively, and are not <i>nadi</i>. Their vocative singular is हे श्रीः, हे भ्रूः &c., while the vocative singular of <i>stri</i> is हे स्त्रि.",
    "14005": "श्री + आम् = श्री इयङ् + आम् = श्रीयाम्; भ्रू + आम् = भ्रूवाम्; or श्री + आम् = श्रीनुट् + आम् [[7.1.54]] = श्रीणाम्; भ्रू + आम् = भ्रूणाम्. But <i>stri</i> is always <i>nadi</i>. and we have स्त्रीणाम् <i>strinam</i>.\n\nTo the absolute prohibition enjoined by the last <i>sutra</i>, this allows an option in the case of Genitive Plural.",
    "14006": "Feminine words in long <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> have been defined as <i>nadi</i>, words in short vowels can never be termed <i>nadi</i>, while even some words in long vowels have also been excluded from the scope of the definition if they take <i>iyan</i> and <i>uvan</i> The present <i>sutra</i> declares an option in the case of all the above words, when a case-affix having an indicatory ङ follows.\n\nThe case-affixes having an indicatory <i>n</i> are the Dative, Ablative. Genitive and Locative singulars. Thus we have:--\n\nDative मतये or मत्यै, धेनवे or धेन्वै, श्रिये or श्रियै; Ablative and Genitive मतेः or मत्याः, धेनो or धेन्वाः, श्रियः or श्रियाः;  Locative मतौ or मत्याम्, धेनौ or धेन्वां, श्रियि or श्रियां. So also भ्रुवै or भ्रुवे & c. But <i>stri</i> is always स्त्र्यै &c.",
    "14007": "This defines the word <i>ghi</i>. The peculiarity of the declension of <i>ghi</i> words will be treated later on. The word <i>hrasva</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The word <i>sesha</i> or 'the rest' implies 'the words ending in short इ or उ which are not the names of females, or if they are feminine names, they are not <i>nadi</i> words.'\n\nAs अग्नि fire. Before case affixes having an indicatory <i>n</i>, the <i>ghi</i> nouns <i>gunate</i> there vowel [[7.3.111]]. As अग्नि + ङे = अग्ने + ए = अग्नये to the fire. So also  वायु + ङे = वायवे to the wind. But the declension of <i>sakhi</i> in these cases is :- सख्या सख्ये सख्यु and सख्यौ.",
    "14008": "The word <i>pati</i> would have been <i>ghi</i> by the last <i>sutra</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> is therefore a <i>niyama</i> rule, restricting the use of <i>ghi</i> in the case of <i>pati</i> to its occurring in composition. The word <i>eva</i> 'only' is used in a restrictive sense.\n\nAs पत्या by the lord but प्रजापतिना by the lord of creatures. So also पत्ये and प्रजापतये; पत्युः and प्रजापतेः, पत्यौ and प्रजापतौ &c. When पति is <i>ghi</i>, there is <i>guna</i> of the vowel before the four ङित् affixes by [[7.3.111]].",
    "14009": "The word <i>pati</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. By the last <i>sutra</i>, <i>pati</i> would have not been <i>ghi</i> when not in composition. This <i>sutra</i> makes an exception to that when this word occurs in the <i>Vaidic</i> literature.\n\nकुलुञ्चानां पतये or पत्ये नमः salutation to the lord of the <i>Kulunchas</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used in connection with a noun in the genitive case'? Observe मया पत्या जरट्टषिर्यथासः.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the <i>Chhandas</i>'? Observe ग्रामस्य पत्ये.",
    "14010": "This defines the word <i>Laghu</i>. A <i>hrasva</i> vowel which has already been defined [[1.2.27]], is under certain circumstances called <i>laghu</i> or 'light'; thus the <i>i</i> of भिद to break, is <i>laghu</i>, and by being <i>laghu</i> it is <i>gunated</i> before the affix ता + आ, as भेत्ता he will break, by virtue of the rule (VII 3. 86), which declares that a <i>laghu</i> penultimate vowel is <i>gunated</i> before a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> or an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. So also छेत्ता, अचीकरत् and अजीहरत्.",
    "14011": "A <i>hrasva</i> vowel however is not to be called 'light' when it is followed by a conjunct consonant. As the <i>i</i> of शिक्षा 'learning' is a heavy vowel. Thus शिक्षा is derived from शिक्ष + अ [[3.3.103]], (let the affix अ come after that verb which has a heavy vowel and ends in a consonant when the word to be formed is feminine). So also कुण्डा and भिक्षा.",
    "14012": "This is clear the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word conjunct is not understood in this <i>sutra</i>. As <i>i</i> of ईहांचक्रे he endeavoured, ईक्षांचक्रे he saw. Here the letter ई is <i>guru</i>, and because of its being called <i>guru</i>, the rule [[3.1.36]] is applied in forming the perfect tense by the addition of the augment आस्. Thus all long vowels, and short vowels followed by conjunct consonants are <i>guru</i> or heavy. All other short vowels are <i>laghu</i>.",
    "14013": "The words of this <i>sutra</i> require some explanation. <i>Yasmat</i> after whatsoever; <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>vidhih</i> compound of <i>pratyaya</i> meaning an affix and <i>vidhih</i>, a precept i.e. a rule enjoying an affix; <i>tadadi</i>, I. S. that which begins therewith <i>pratyaye</i> 7. S. = in a <i>pratyaya</i> i.e. when a <i>pratyaya</i> follows (1. 1.) is called a base.\n\nAfter whatsoever there is an affix enjoined, whether it be a verbal root (<i>Dhatu</i>) or a nominal base (<i>pratipadika</i>), the word-form having that as its beginning, is called an <i>anga</i>, with regard to the affix that follows. The word <i>yasmat</i> is used in the aphorism to point out the thing named, as <i>anga</i>; because the word <i>tadadi</i> follows it. This defines the word <i>anga</i>. The word 'base' is thus a relative term with regard to its affix. Thus कृ + ता = कर्ता he will do हर्ता he will lose. करिष्यति, हरिष्यति. Here because the root कृ and हृ gets the name अंग they are <i>gunated</i> by [[7.3.84]]. Similarly because उपगु &c. get the name <i>Anga</i>, their vowel is <i>vriddhied</i> in औपगवः &c.\n\nThe words <i>kri</i> <i>hri</i> are <i>anga</i> with regard to the affix <i>ta</i> &c. उपगु + अण् = औपगवः; कापटवः. Here <i>upagu</i> and <i>kapatu</i> are <i>anga</i> with regard to <i>an</i>. Similarly कृ + स्य + वः = करिष्य + वः = करिष्यावः. Here the whole word form <i>Karishya</i> is regarded as <i>anga</i>, and as such the short <i>a</i> is lengthened by [[7.3.101]]; because though the affix <i>vah</i> is enjoined after the word <i>kri</i>, the form which begins with <i>kri</i> i.e. <i>karishya</i> will also be called <i>anga</i> when the affix is to be added. The word <i>tadadi</i>, therefore, has been used in the <i>sutra</i>, to make the definition of <i>Anga</i> applicable to the forms which a word may assume after taking the intermediate affixes like <i>sya</i> &c., or नुम् before the final affixes. Thus कुण्ड + नुम् + इ = कुण्डन् + इ = कुण्डानि [[7.1.72]] and [[6.4.8]] <i>kunda</i> + <i>num</i> + <i>i</i> = <i>kundan</i> +<i>i</i>  = <i>kundani</i>, bowls. Here the whole form <i>kundan</i> is called <i>anga</i>, and as such it lengthens its vowel before the case-affix <i>i</i> by [[6.4.8]].\n\nWhy have we used the word <i>pratyaya</i>? Without it the rule would have run thus :- 'After whatever there is anything enjoined &c., is called <i>Anga</i>.' Then in स्त्री + इयती = स्त्रयती. Here <i>sandhi</i> of vowels is enjoined between ई + इ = ई. If स्त्री was here an <i>Anga</i>, then its last last vowel would have been replaced by इयङ् [[6.4.77]], the form being स्त्रियियति.\n\nWhy have we used the word विधि ? Had we omitted it the rule would have run thus:-- \"After whatsoever there is an affix, whether root or <i>pratipadika</i> is <i>Anga</i>.\" Thus in दधि अधुना, though the affix <i>adhuna</i> is placed after the word <i>dadhi</i>, it is not enjoined by any rule, and the word दधि is not called <i>anga</i>. Had it been so called, then the इ of <i>dadhi</i> should have been elided by rule [[6.4.148]].\n\nThe word <i>pratyaya</i> has been repeated twice in this <i>sutra</i> in order to show that when an affix is elided, the term <i>anga</i> will not apply to what stood before it. Thus in the compound word स्त्रियै + अर्थं = स्त्र्यर्थं for the sake of the woman. Here in forming the <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound the dative case-affix after the word स्त्री has been elided, for as a general rule case-affixes are elided in forming compounds. If the word स्त्री after its affix had been elided, still retained its old designation of <i>Anga</i>, the स्त्री + अर्थं would have been स्त्रियर्थं, the augment <i>iyan</i> being added by the rule already referred to above.",
    "14014": "The <i>sup</i> or case-affixes are those by which nouns are declined; and <i>tin</i> are tense-affixes by which verbs are conjugated. They have already been given before. Thus ब्राह्मण + जस् = ब्राह्मणाः the <i>Brahmanas</i> पचन्ति they cook.\n\nIt might be asked by a caviller why the word अन्त has been used in the aphorism, for by the rule of <i>tadanta</i> given in <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.72]] a rule relating to <i>sup</i> will mean and include also that which ended with a <i>sup</i>-affix. To this we reply, that the very fact that the word <i>anta</i> is used in this <i>sutra</i>, indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>) that the <i>Tadanta</i> rule of <i>Sutra</i> 72 Chapter I does not apply to rules of <i>sanjna</i> (definition) made with regard to affixes. Thus <i>tarap</i> and <i>tamap</i> affixes are called <i>gha</i> by <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.22]]. The <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> will not apply here; words ending with these affixes will not be called <i>gha</i>. Thus ब्राह्मणितरा will not be called <i>gha</i>, for had it been so called, the long ई will be shortened in गौरी ब्राह्मणितरा. In short, 'an affix when employed in a rule which teaches the meaning of a technical term (<i>sanjna</i>) does not denote a word-form ending with the affix.'",
    "14015": "These are affixes by which denominative verbs are formed from nouns. See [[3.1.8]], [[3.1.11]], and [[3.1.13]]. A word ending in न is called <i>pada</i>, when these affixes follow. Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राजीय 3rd Per. 8. राजीयति he behaves like a king. So also राजन् + क्यङ् = राजायते (VII. 4. 5.) चर्मन् + क्यष् = चर्मायते or चर्मायति. The result of its being called <i>pada</i> is that the न् of राजन्, चर्मन् &c., is elided by <i>Sutra</i> [[8.2.7]]. (there is elision of न् final in a <i>pada</i> which is entitled to the designation of <i>pratipadika</i>). Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राज + य = राजीय [[7.4.33]].\n\nThese three affixes क्यच् &c., come after case-inflected words (i.e., words ending in <i>sup</i>), and though, before these affixes, the case terminations are elided, still by <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.62]] such words would have retained the name of <i>pada</i> which they got by Rule 14 of this Chapter. The present <i>sutra</i> however makes a restriction (<i>niyama</i>). It declares that only words ending in न् retain the name of <i>pada</i>; while all other case-inflected words before these affixes do not retain that designation. Thus the words वाच् speech, स्रुच् a ladle are not treated as <i>pada</i> and we have वाच्यते and स्रुच्यते. Had they been <i>pada</i>, the च् would have been changed into क् by [[8.2.30]].",
    "14016": "The sutra 18 of this chapter teaches that before certain affixes, the preceding word is called <i>bha</i>. This <i>sutra</i> declares an exception to that by anticipation. Thus Rule [[4.2.115]] declares: -- \"Affixes ठक् and छस् come after the <i>vriddha</i> [[1.1.74]] word भवत्.\" Here the affix छस् has an indicatory स्, therefore the word भवत्, standing before it, will be called <i>pada</i>. Thus भवत् + छस् = भवदीयः [[7.1.2]], belonging to you. The result of being <i>pada</i> is that ते is changed into द (VIII 2. 39). Similarly स् is इत् in युस् (After the word <i>urna</i> there is <i>yus</i> [[5.2.123]]. Thus ऊर्णायुः; so also घस् [[5.1.106]], has स् as indicatory. Thus ॠत्वियः There is no <i>guna</i> because of its being <i>pada</i>",
    "14017": "The affixes beginning with <i>su</i> and ending with <i>kap</i> are meant by the above <i>sutra</i>. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् (Ins Dual) is an affix included in the above. Thus राजन् + भ्याम् = राजभ्याम्, राजभिः, राजत्वं, राजता, राजतरः, राजतमः The न is elided by being <i>pada</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not a <i>Sarvanamasthana</i>'? Observe राजन् + औ = राजानौ two kings. kings. राजानः kings. The न is not elided.",
    "14018": "This debars the application of <i>pada</i>. Thus गर्ग + यञ् [[4.1.105]] = गार्ग्यः a grandson of <i>Garga</i>. So also वात्स्यः. The affix <i>yan</i> begins with a <i>ya</i> and the word <i>garga</i> being treated as <i>Bha</i> its final अ is elided before the affix by [[6.4.148]].\n\nSo also दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षिः [[4.1.95]] grandson of <i>Daksha</i> प्लाक्षिः. Here the affix इञ् begins with a vowel the word standing before it being <i>Bha</i>, it causes elision of the final अ of <i>daksha</i>.\n\nThe word यचि is in the 7th case meaning when य् or अच् follow; and by the last <i>Vart</i> of <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.72]], it means 'when an affix beginning with <i>ya</i> or <i>ach</i> follow.'\n\nVart:- The words नभस्, अङ्गिरस् and मनुष् should be treated as <i>Bha</i> when the affix वत् follows. Thus नभस्वत् like the sky. अङ्गिरस् like the <i>Angiras</i>. मनुष्वत् like the man. By being <i>Bha</i>, the स् is not changed into र्, which it would have been, had it been a <i>pada</i> [[8.2.66]].\n\nVart:- The words वृषन् is treated as <i>Bha</i> in the vedas when the words वसु and अश्व follow. Thus वृषण्वसुः; वृषणश्वस्य मेने Here had the word <i>vrishan</i> been treated as <i>pada</i>, the न would not have been changed into ण (See Rule [[8.4.37]]); and this न would have been dropped before the affix <i>vasu</i> by [[8.2.7]].",
    "14019": "The word <i>Bha</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus is the word उदश्वित्वत् having butter milk Nom. Sing. उदश्वित्वान् पोषः the herdsman having butter milk, विद्युत्वान् बलाहकः the cloud full of thunder. So also यशस्वी famous; पयस्वी full of milk. Thus उदश्वित् + वतुप् = उदश्वित्वत्, यशस् + विनि [[5.2.121]] = यशस्विन्. By making these <i>Bha</i>, the operation of <i>pada</i> rule is debarred in their case. That is to say the त of <i>udasvit</i> &c., and the स् of <i>yasas</i> &c., are not changed into द and र respectively, which had they been <i>pada</i> words would have been the case by the action of <i>Sutra</i> [[8.2.39]], and [[8.2.66]]. viz., उदश्विद्वत् and यशोविन् which are incorrect.",
    "14020": "These words being taught here in the topic relating to <i>pada</i> and <i>Bha</i>, show that they have been properly forced in the <i>chhandas</i> by the application of the rules of <i>Bha</i> and <i>pada</i>. Thus अयस् + मय = अयस्मय made of iron. Here the word अयस् is treated as <i>Bha</i> and hence the स् is not changed into र. Thus अयस्मयं वर्म iron-made coat of mail. अयस्मयानि पात्राणि iron vessels. The present form of this word is अयोमयं. In some places both these <i>pada</i> and <i>Bha</i> apply simultaneously. Thus in the word ॠक्वत् formed by ऋच् + वत्, the च् is first changed into क् by treating the word rich as a <i>pada</i>. Then the word ॠक् is treated as <i>Bha</i>, and therefore the क् is not changed into ग् before वत्. For had it been <i>pada</i>, the form would have been ॠग्वत् <i>Rigvat</i>. These irregularly formed words occur only in the <i>chhandas</i> or Vedic literature. Thus स सुष्टुभास ऋक्वता गणेन.",
    "14021": "When it is intended to denote multeity those affixes should be employed after nouns and verbs, which denote plural number. Thus ब्राह्मणाः पठन्ति, The <i>Brahmins</i> read.\n\nThis rule applies to words which are capable of expressing numbers. Indeclinables (<i>Avyaya</i>) do not admit of numbers, and consequently they are always in singular number which is the general form.",
    "14022": "This is also clear. When duality is to be expressed, a dual case-affix should be employed, and in the case of unit, the singular case-affix. Thus ब्राह्मणौ पचतः the two <i>Brahmins</i> cook. ब्राह्मणः पचति the <i>Brahmin</i> cooks.",
    "14023": "Any thing that helps towards the accomplishment of an action is a <i>karaka</i>. Thus in 'cooking,' the fire, the furnace, the vessel, the cook are all helpers in the accomplishment of the action. Thus '<i>Rama</i> cooks food in a vessel, by the fire from the furnace for his master.' Here <i>Rama</i> is agent <i>karaka</i>; 'food' is object <i>karaka</i>; 'vessel' is a locative <i>karaka</i>, fire is an instrumental <i>karaka</i>, 'furnace' is the ablative <i>karaka</i> and 'master' is the dative <i>karaka</i>.\n\nThe word '<i>karaka</i>' thus is synonymous with the word cause (<i>hetu</i>) and occasion (<i>nimitta</i>). All the various causes and the occasions that are required to complete an action will be <i>karakas</i>. Out of the seven cases in which a sanskrit noun is declined, six represent such relation with an action.

As देवदत्ताय ह्नुते he hides from (wishing that <i>Devadatta</i> should know of it) <i>Devadatta</i>, देवदत्ताय तिष्ठते she offers herself to <i>Devadatta</i> (for sexual embrace, wishing that he should know of it). देवदत्ताय शपते he reviles <i>Devadatta</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'the person whom it is intended to inform'? Observe देवदत्ताय श्लाघति पथि. Here <i>pathi</i> is in the Locative case.",
    "14035": "The word उत्तमर्ण is compounded of two words उत्तम best and ऋण debt meaning (whose debt is best) creditor, as opposed to अधमर्ण debtor. As देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति he owes hundred to <i>Devadatta</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'the creditor is called Recipient'? Observe देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति ग्रामे he owes hundred to <i>Devadatta</i> in the village. Here village is in the Locative case.",
    "14036": "The verb स्पृह to desire, belongs to the <i>churadi</i> class. The word governed by this verb takes the Dative case. As पुष्पेभ्यः स्पृहयति he desires flowers, फलेभ्यः स्पृहयति he desires fruits.\n\nWhy do we say 'the thing desired.' Observe पुष्पेभ्यो वने स्पृहयति he desires flowers in the forest. Here वने is in the Locative case.",
    "14037": "<i>Krudh</i> means non-tolerance, <i>droha</i> means doing wrong or hurt, <i>irshya</i> jealousy; and <i>asuya</i> means to find out the faults of another. The word <i>kopa</i> includes all the above four sorts of actions. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति-द्रुह्यति-ईर्ष्यति or असूयति he is angry upon, (i. e. with) or bears malice to, or is jealous of, or finds out the faults of <i>Devadatta</i>. Here <i>Devadatta</i> is in the Dative case.\n\nWhy do we say 'against whom the feeling of anger is directed.' Be if there be no feeling of anger, then these verbs will not govern the dative case, but the accusative. Thus भार्यामीर्ष्यति he is jealous of his wife, i.e., does not wish her to be seen by others. Here the word <i>bharya</i> is in the accusative case.",
    "14038": "This aphorism is a proviso to the last, and enjoins accusative case, where by the last, there would have been dative. The word <i>upasrishta</i> means having <i>upasarga</i> or preposition. As देवदत्तमभिक्रुध्यति अभिद्रुह्यति. When used simply, those verbs of course govern the Dative case by the last aphorism. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति.",
    "14039": "The word <i>viprasna</i> means literally asking various questions; and denotes questioning about the good or bad luck of another. Thus देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते गर्गः <i>Garga</i> is favorable to or looks to <i>Devadatta</i>, the sense is that being casually asked by <i>Devadatta</i>, he reflects upon the good or bad fortune of <i>Devadatta</i>.\n\nAnother explanation of this <i>sutra</i> is, the agent that puts various questions is put in the dative case, As शिष्याय राध्नोति or ईक्षते वा गुरुः meaning, the pupil asks the teacher various questions to resolve his doubts, and the teacher answers those questions to the pupil.",
    "14040": "The compound verb प्रतिश्रू and आश्रू means to promise. A promise is made on the motion or at the instance of another. The person so proposing who was the agent of the former action becomes the recipient of the promise in the latter case. As देवदत्ताय गां प्रतिशृणोति--आशृणोति he promises a cow to <i>Devadatta</i>.",
    "14041": "The phrase <i>purvasya</i> <i>karta</i> of the last is to be read into this aphorism. As होत्रे ऽनुगृणाति. They encourage the <i>Hotri</i>, i.e. the <i>Hotri</i> priest invokes first, the others then follow him in invocation and by so doing encourage him. The word अनुगरः and प्रतिगरः mean encouraging the invoker.",
    "14042": "A दात्रेण लुनाति he cuts with the sickle. परशुना छिनत्ति he divides by the axe. The instrument कारक takes the third-case affix.\n\nWhy do we say 'especially'? Because in the case of the other <i>karakas</i>, the non-mention of the word 'especially' makes it possible for us to use those cases, in not their strict sense. Thus though the locative case should be used where strictly a thing is located in another, yet we may say गङ्गायां घोषः the herdsman in the Ganges, not strictly in, but on the banks of, the Ganges. कूपे गर्गकुलम् the family of frogs in the well, i.e. on the sides of the well.",
    "14043": "The present <i>sutra</i> ordains accusative case, where by the operation of the last aphorism there ought to have been Instrumental case. The force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that <i>karana</i> is also to be read into this. As अक्षात् दीव्यति or अक्षै र्दीव्यति he plays the dice or with the dice.",
    "14044": "This ordains dative case, where there would otherwise have been Instrumental case. The word परिक्रयणे means to engage for a limited period on payment of wages, and not absolute purchase for all time. As शताय परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि शतेन परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि.",
    "14045": "That in which the action is supported or located is called <i>adhara</i>. As कटे आस्ते he is seated on the mat. कटे शेते he is sleeping on the mat. स्थाल्यां पचति he cooks in the pot. The <i>Adhikarana</i> takes the 7th case-affix.",
    "14046": "This ordains accusative case, where otherwise by the last <i>sutra</i> there would have been the Locative case. As ग्राममधिशेते अधितिष्ठति or अध्यास्ते he lies down, occupies or lies in the village.",
    "14047": "As ग्राममभिनिविशते he resorts to the village. This is an optional rule, as the word \"option\" of <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.44]] should be read into it. Thus we have the following forms also पापेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to sin. कल्याणेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to good. The rule here is that of <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasa</i>.",
    "14048": "As ग्राममुपवसति सेना the army dwells in the village पर्वतमुपवसति-अनुवसति अधिवसति or आवसति.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when the verb वस् means \"fasting,\" or does not denote lying in a locality. As ग्रामे उपवसति he fasts in the village. Here the verb <i>upavasati</i> governs the locative case and not the accusative.",
    "14049": "That which is especially desired by the agent to be accomplished by the action is called <i>karma</i>. As कटं करोति He makes the mat. ग्रामं गच्छति he goes to the village. Why do we say \"desired by the agent\"? Observe माषेष्व श्वं बध्नाति he ties the horse in the gram field. Here gram is no doubt most desired by the horse, but as the horse is not the agent of the verb, the word माष takes the locative case. Why do we use the word \"most\"? Observe पयसौदनं भुङ्क्ते he eats the food along with the milk. Here milk is me doubt desired by the agent, but not being the principal object desired, takes the Instrumental case.\n\nThough the word कर्म was understood in this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from the last <i>sutra</i>, the repetition of this word here is to indicate that the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>adhara</i> does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>, because as we do not take the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>karma</i> into this <i>sutra</i>, we do not take the <i>anuvritti</i> of any word of the previous <i>sutra</i> into this. Had we taken the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>karma</i> from the last <i>sutra</i>, then we could use the accusative case in those limited instances, where the word is capable of taking the Locative case also, but not in other cases. Thus while we could very well say गेहं प्रविशति he enters the house, we could not say ओदनं पचति he cooks the food, सक्तुं पिबति he drinks <i>saktu</i>. By repeating the word <i>karma</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, such examples become valid everywhere. The <i>karma</i>-<i>karaka</i>, takes the second case-affix.",
    "14050": "That which is not desired by the agent is <i>anipsita</i> or object of aversion. Thus विषं भक्षयति he eats poison, चोरात् पश्यति. He sees the thieves. ग्रामम् गच्छन् वृक्षमूला न्युपसर्पति going to the village, he plucks the roots of the trees.",
    "14051": "There are some verbs in Sanskrit which take what is called an <i>akathita</i> object, in addition to their usual direct one. As its name indicates, it is that object which is not otherwise <i>kathita</i> or mentioned by way of any of the other case relations, such as अपादान अधिकरण &c. and is, therefore optional. If the noun capable of taking this <i>akathita</i> object be not intended for any other case, it is put in the Accusative case with such verbs; as, धेनुं दोग्धि पयः he milks the cow (her milk) व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां 'he confines the cow to the fold.' Here धेनुं and व्रजं are <i>akathita</i> or optional objects. If the speaker does not intend to have this object, the words will be put in their natural cases; as, धेन्वाः (ablative), पयोदोग्धि, व्रजे (locative) अवरुणद्धि गां.\n\nThe roots that are capable of governing two accusatives are mentioned in the following <i>karika</i>:-- दुह्याच् पच् दण्ड् रुधि प्रच्छि चि ब्रू शासु जि मन्थ् मुषाम् ॥ कर्मयुक् स्यादकथितं तथा स्या न्नी हृ कृष् वहाम् ॥\n\nIn the case of the roots दुह् 'to milk' याच् 'to beg,' पच् 'to cook,' दण्ड् 'to punish,' रुध् 'to obstruct or confine' प्रच्छ् 'to ask,' चि 'to collect' ब्रू 'to tell' शास् 'instruct' जि 'to win' (as a prize of wager) मन्थ् 'to churn' मुष् 'to steal,' and also in the case of नी, हृ, कृष्, and वह all meaning 'to take or carry' and others having the same signification, that noun which, besides the direct object, is affected by the verb, is put in the Accusative case; as, गां दोग्धि पयः (S. K.) 'he milks the cow'; बलिं याचते वसुधां. He begs the earth of <i>Bali</i>; similarly तंडुलानोदनं पचति, गर्गाञ् शतं दण्डयति, व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां, माणवकं पंथानं पृच्छति, वृक्षमवचिनोति फलानि, माणवकं धर्मं ब्रूते-शास्तिवा, शतं जयति देवदत्तं, सुधां क्षीरनिधिं मथ्नाति, देवदत्तं शतं मुष्णाति; ग्राममजां नयति-हरति-कर्षति-वहति वा are examples of the other roots in order. माणवकं धर्मं भाषते वक्ति वा, बलिं वसुधां भिक्षते, तां त्वां संवरणस्यार्थे वरयामि विभावसो are instances of this kind of object, because भाष् or वाच् and भिक्ष् or वृ have the same meaning as ब्रू and वाच्, the roots given in the <i>Kasika</i>.\n\nObs.-- The roots चि, मुष्, पच् मंथ्, रुध्, जि, कृष् हृ and ever वह् are of every rare occurrence as governing two accusatives, in the classical literature, though given in the above list.\n\nThe roots mentioned above and others having the same sense, take two objects. One of them is principal, and the other, secondary. In the case of the first twelve roots from दुह् to मुष्, the nouns पयः, वसुधां, फलानि, सुधां, &c. are principal objects, and गां, बलिं, वृक्षं, क्षीरनिधिं &c. are secondary objects, for they can, according to the speaker's volition, be put in other cases. And in the case of the last four roots अजा, is the principal object and ग्रामं the secondary. Thus that which is necessarily put in the accusative case in order to complete the idea of the verb, is the principal object, and that which may be put in the Accusative case, depending upon the speaker's will, is called the secondary object.",
    "14052": "In the case of the roots that imply 'motion,' 'knowledge' or 'information' or some kind of 'eating,' and other roots having a similar sense; also of roots that have some literary work for their object, and of intransitive roots, that which is the subject of the verb in its primitive sense is put in the Accusative case in the causal, the object remaining unchanged; e. g.\n\n- PRIMITIVE - शत्रवः स्वर्गमगच्छन्, CAUSAL - शत्रून् स्वर्गमगमयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - स्वे वेदार्थमविदुः, CAUSAL - स्वान् वेदार्थम् अवेदयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - देवा अमृतमाश्नन्, CAUSAL - देवानमृतमाशयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - विधिर्वेदध्यैत, CAUSAL - विधिं वेदमध्यापयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - पृथ्वी सलिले आस्त, CAUSAL - पृथ्वीं सलिले आसयत् ।\n\nBut in गमयति रामो गोविन्दं (<i>Rama</i> makes <i>Govind</i> go) if some body else (विष्णु मित्र) prompts <i>Rama</i> to do this, we shall have to say, विष्णुमित्रो रामेण गोविन्दं गमयति '<i>Vishnu</i> <i>mitra</i> prompts <i>Rama</i> to cause <i>Govind</i> to go.' Here '<i>Rama</i>' is not put in the Accusative case, because it is the subject of the Verb, not in its primitive, but causal, sense. <i>Patanjali</i>, in his <i>Mahabhashya</i>, adds this explanation on the meaning of the word शब्दकर्म in the <i>sutra</i> गतिबुद्धि &c. शब्दकर्म may be either शब्दो येषां क्रिया or शब्दो येषं कर्म.\n\nWhen we take the former interpretation, the roots ह्वयति (ह्वे) क्रंदति (क्रंद) and शब्दायते (denom. of शब्द) have to be excluded from the rule; as, ह्वयति देवदत्तः हाययति देवदत्तेन; क्रंदति-शब्दायते-देवदत्तः; क्रंदयति-शब्दाययति-देवदत्तेन. And the roots श्रु, ज्ञा with वि and लभ् with उप must be included in the rule; as, शृणोति विजानाति-उपलभते-देवदत्तः श्रावयति-विज्ञापयति-उपलंभयति-देवदत्तम्. When we adopt the second interpretation, the roots जल्प्, भाष् with आ and लप with वि, must be included in the rule; हल्पति-विलपति-आभाषते-देवदत्तः, जल्पयति-विलापयति-आभाषयति-देवदत्तं.\n\nThere are several exceptions and counter-exceptions to the preceding rule, which are important.\n\nVart:- The causals of नी 'to lead' and वह् 'to carry,' do not govern the Accusative, but the Instrumental; e. g. भृत्यो भारं नयति वहति वा A servant carries a load. भृत्येन भारं नाययति वाहयति वा (<i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>) (He) causes a servant to carry a load.\n\nVart:- But वह्, when it has for its subject in the causal a word signifying a 'driver,' obeys the general rule; as, वाहा रथं वहन्ति. Horses draw the chariot. वहंति यवान् वलीवर्दाः.\n\nVart:- (b). The causals of the roots अद् and खाद्, 'to eat,' govern the Instrumental case; e.g. वटुरन्नमत्ति खादति वा. The boy eats his food. वटुनान्नमादयति खादयति वा. (He) causes the boy to eat his food.\n\nVart:- (c). भक्ष्, when it has not the sense of हिंसा 'injury to a sentient thing,' governs the Instrumental; as, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तः, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तेन; but भक्षयति यवान् बलीवर्दाः, भक्षयति वली वर्दान् यवान्.\n\nBy 'intransitive' roots mentioned above is meant such roots as are not by their nature capable of governing an object other than that of 'time,' 'place' &c., and not those roots which, though transitive, may sometimes be used intransitively according to the speaker's volition, or when their meaning is, quite evident; as, किंकरः पचरः पचति. Here पचति, though transitive, is used without an object, because it can be easily understood; hence किंकरेण पाचयति and not किंकरं; but मासमासयति देवदत्तं.\n\nIn forming the passive construction of causal verbs, the principal object in the causal, which is the subject (agent) of the verb in its primitive sense, is put in the Nominative case, and the other object remains unchanged; e. g.\n\n- PRIMITIVE - रामो ग्रामं गच्छति., CAUSAL ACTIVE - रामं ग्रामं गमयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - रामो ग्रामं गम्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - <i>Rama</i> goes to a village., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes <i>Rama</i> to go to a village., CAUSAL PASSIVE - <i>Rama</i> is caused to go &c.\n- PRIMITIVE - भृत्यः कटं करोति, CAUSAL ACTIVE - भृत्येन भृत्यं वा कटं कारयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - भृत्यः कटं कार्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - The Servant prepares a mat., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes the servant to prepare a mat., CAUSAL PASSIVE - The servant is made to prepare &c.\n- PRIMITIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्ते., CAUSAL ACTIVE - गोविंदं मासमासयति, CAUSAL PASSIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - <i>Govind</i> sits for one month., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He makes <i>Govind</i> sit &c., CAUSAL PASSIVE - <i>Govind</i> is made to sit &c.\n\n(a). But in the case of roots that imply 'knowledge' 'eating,' and those that have a literary work for their object, the principal object is put in the Nominative case, and the secondary in the Accusative, or vice versa e.g. माणवकं धर्मं बोधयति 'he makes <i>Manavaka</i> know his duty'; माणवको धर्मं बोध्यते or माणवकं धर्मो बोध्यते '<i>Manavaka</i> is made known his duty' or 'duty is made known to <i>Manavaka</i>'; वटुमोदनं भोजयति 'he makes the boy eat food:' वटुरोदनं भोजयते or वटुमोदनां भोज्यते (<i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>).\n\nWith regards to roots that govern two accusatives, the rules mentioned above bold good in their case also; i.e., those roots that imply motion &c., govern the Accusative of the subject of the primitive Case, and others, the Instrumental case, sometimes; as, वामनो बलिं वसुधां याचते : (ईश्वरो) वामनेन बलिं वसुधां याचयति (God) makes <i>Vamana</i> ask <i>Bali</i> for Earth.' गोपोऽजां नगरं हरति; (स्वामी) गोपं गोपेन वाजां नगरं हारयति. '(The master) makes the cowherd take the sheep to the town.'",

Similarly परिणयति, प्रणायकः, परिणायकः.\n\nWhy do we say when in composition with a verb? When in composition with a noun they are not called <i>upasargas</i>. As प्रगतो नायकोऽस्माद् देशात् = प्रनायकोदेशः a country destitute of a leader. Here न is not changed into ण. Thus while प्रणायकः means 'a leader' the term प्रनायकः means destitute of a leader; though both have the same radical elements :-- <i>pra</i> in one is an <i>upasarga</i>, in the other a <i>Nipata</i> pure and simple.\n\nVart:- The word मरुत् should be included in the list of <i>upasargas</i>.

To this we say that otherwise the giving the designation of <i>upasarga</i> to मरुत् is superfluous; and in order that this should not be so, the fact of its not ending with a vowel is overlooked.\n\nVart:- The particle श्रत् should be included in the list of <i>upasargas</i>.

So that while <i>pra</i> &c., have two names <i>upasarga</i> and <i>gati</i>; <i>uri</i> &c., have only one name, namely, <i>gati</i>.\n\nThus in प्रणीतम् and अभिषि॑क्तम्, by treating the words अ and अभि as <i>upasargas</i> we change the न and स into ण and ष by rule [[8.4.14]] and [[8.3.87]]; and again treating them as <i>gati</i> we regulate the accent.\n\nVart:- The words कारिका should be included in the list of <i>Gati</i>. As (1) कारिकाकृत्य (2) कारिकाकृतम् (3) यत्कारिका करोति. In the first by taking it as <i>gati</i> we have <i>samasa</i> [[2.2.18]] and ल्यप् [[7.1.37]] The other two cases illustrate accent.\n\nVart:- The words पुनर् and चनस् are treated as <i>Gati</i> in the <i>Vedas</i>. As पुनरुत्स्यूतंवासो देयम्. Here the word पुनर् being <i>gati</i>, causes स्यूतं to take <i>anudatta</i> accent [[8.1.70]] चनोहितः. Here also the accent is regulated by [[8.2.71]].",
    "14061": "The affixes <i>chvi</i> and <i>dach</i> are ordained when the verb in composition is either कृ, भू or अस् [[5.4.50]] and [[5.4.57]] <i>uri</i> &c., being read along with <i>chvi</i> and <i>dach</i>, shows that the verb in composition with them must also be any one of the above three verbs, and none else; in order to entitle ऊरी to the name of <i>gati</i>.\n\nThe words ऊरी and उररी mean to assent and spread. As ऊरीकृत्य [[2.2.18]] and [[7.1.37]] ऊरीकृतम् [[6.2.49]], यदूरीकरोति [[8.2.71]]. So with the word उररी. The following is a list of these words :-\n\n- पापी. धूसी. भ्रंशकला. फली.\n- ताली. शकला. गुलुगुधा. विल्फी.\n- आताली. संशकला. सजूः आल्की.\n- वेताली. ध्वंसकला. फलू.\n\nThe words ending in <i>chvi</i> are also <i>gati</i>. As शुक्लीकृत्य having made white what was not white.\n\nSo also words ending in डाच् as पटपटाकृत्य having made the sound <i>pat</i>.",
    "14062": "The phrase अनितिपरम् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound; अन्-इति-परम् = 'that which has not the word इति after it.'\n\nAs खाट्कृत्य having made the sound <i>khat</i>. खाट्कृतम् [[6.2.49]], यत्खाट्-करोति [[8.2.71]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when it has not the word इति after it?' Observe खाडितिकृत्वा निरष्ठीवत्.",
    "14063": "As सत्कृत्य having honored [[2.2.18]] and [[7.1.37]] असत्कृत्य, सत्कृतम् or असत्कृतम् [[6.2.49]] यत् सत् करोति or यदसत् करोति [[8.2.71]].\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'respect or disrespect'? Observe सत्कृत्वा काण्डं गतः.",
    "14064": "The word अलम् is an indeclinable and has four meanings :- 'prohibition, competent, enough and ornament.' The term अलम् is <i>gati</i> when it means ornament.\nAs अलंकृत्य [[2.2.18]], [[7.1.37]]; अलंकृतं [[6.2.49]] यदलंकरोति [[8.2.71]] when it does not mean ornament we have अलं भुक्त्वा व्रजति he goes having eaten enough.",
    "14065": "The word परिग्रह means 'taking' or 'accepting,' अपरिग्रह means therefore the opposite of this namely 'rejecting,' abandoning. As अन्तर्हत्य गृहंगतः he went away having abandoned home; अन्तर्हतमनृतम् falsehood being abandoned. यदन्तर्हन्ति.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to abandon'? Observe अन्तर्हत्वा मूषिकां श्येनोगतः the hawk went away taking hold of the mouse.\n\nVart:- The word अन्तर् is treated as an <i>upasarga</i> for the purpose of the application of the following rules; [[3.3.106]] by which अङ् is added; rule [[3.3.92]] by which कि is added; the rule [[8.4.14]] by which न is changed in to ण. As अन्तर्द्धा, अन्तर्द्धिः and अन्तर्णयति.",
    "14066": "The word श्रद्धा-प्रतीघात means 'satisfaction of desire.' As कणेहत्य पयः पिबति he drinks milk to his heart's content or till he is satisfied ? So also मनोहत्य पयः पिबति. That is to say, he drinks so much till his desire (श्रद्धा) is satisfied by revulsion of feeling. When not having this sense we have कणे or मनोहत्वागतः he went away satisfied.",
    "14067": "The pronoun पूर्व 'front' with the affix असि forms पुरस्, and by [[1.1.38]] it becomes an <i>Avyaya</i>. (See [[5.3.39]] <i>pur</i> being substituted for <i>purva</i>). The object by making it <i>gati</i> is threefold (1) compounding by [[2.2.18]] (2) accent by [[6.2.49]] (3) to change the : <i>h</i> into स् by [[8.3.40]]. As पुरस्कृत्य, पुरस्कृतम् and यत् पुरस्करोति, when not an indeclinable we have पूः, पुरौ, पुरः कृत्वा काण्डंगतः.",
    "14068": "The word अस्तम् is an indeclinable as it ends in म् (1. 1. 39); and means 'not visible.' As अस्तंगत्य सविता पुनरुदेति the sun having set, rises again अस्तंगतानि धनानि riches that have vanished. यदस्तं गच्छति, when not an indeclinable it is not <i>gati</i> as अस्तं काण्डम् the arrow has been thrown.",
    "14069": "The word अच्छ is an indeclinable and has the force of the word अभि. As अच्छगत्य, अच्छगतम्, and यदच्छगच्छति. So also अच्छोद्य अच्छोदितम् and यदच्छवदति when not an <i>Avyaya</i>, we have उदकमच्छं गच्छति.",
    "14070": "The word <i>upadesa</i> means a direction to another. When a person cogitates within himself and does not address another, that is <i>anupadesa</i>. That is when it is not a demonstrative pronoun. As अदः कृत्य, अदः कृतम् and यददः करोति when used as a demonstrative pronoun we have अदः कृत्वा काण्डं गतः.",
    "14071": "As तिरोभूय, तिरोभूतम् and यत् तिरोभवति why do we say when meaning disappearance? Observe तिरो भूत्वास्थितः i.e., standing apart.",
    "14072": "This is an example of प्राप्त-विभाषा. As तिरः कृत्य or तिरस्कृत्य [[8.3.42]]: तिरः कृत्वा or तिरस्कृत्वा [[8.3.42]]. The change of <i>visarga</i> into स is optional [[8.3.42]]. When not meaning disappearance we have तिरः कृत्वा काष्ठं तिष्ठति he stands having laid aside the stick.",
    "14073": "As उपाजे कृत्य or उपाजे कृत्वा having given support. अन्वाजे कृत्य or अन्वाजे कृत्वा.",
    "14074": "Vart:- In the words साक्षात् &c. the force of the affix च्वि is understood, namely making a thing what it was not before, As साक्षात् कृत्य or कृत्वा मिथ्याकृत्ये मिथ्याकृत्वा making evident what was concealed before.",
    "14075": "As उरसिकृत्य or उरसिकृत्वा; मनसिकृत्य or मनसिकृत्वा. When it has the sense of placing we have उरसिकृत्वा पाणिं शेते he lies down having clasped the hand on the breast, मनसिकृत्वा वचनं ध्यायति he ponders having placed the word in his mind.",
    "14076": "As मध्ये कृत्य or कृत्वा. पदे कृत्य or कृत्वा; निवचने कृत्य or कृत्वा.\n\nBut when it has the meaning of placing we have हस्तिनः पदे कृत्वा शिरः शेते he lies down having put his head under the foot of the elephant.",
    "14077": "As पाणौ कृत्य or हस्ते कृत्य having married. But हस्ते कृत्वा कार्षापणं गतः he went out having taken in his hand a <i>karshapana</i> (a coin).",
    "14078": "The word प्राध्वम् ends in म् and means 'favourably suitably.' When however it means 'bound' it is a <i>gati</i>: as, प्राध्वंकृत्य having bound. But when not meaning to bind, we have :- प्राध्वं कृत्वा शकटं गतः having made the carriage agreeable, he is gone.",
    "14079": "As जीविकाकृत्य having made it as if it was a means of living; उपनिषत्कृत्य--having made it like an <i>upanishad</i>. But जीविका कृत्वा गतः having made his livelihood he is gone.",
    "14080": "The word ते has been employed to include the term उपसर्ग also. The preceding examples all illustrate the application of this rule.",
    "14081": "As.-- वायविन्द्रश्च सुन्वत आयातमुपनिष्कृतम् ॥ मक्ष्वित्था धिया नरा (<i>Rig</i>.I. 2. 6).\n\nIn this we have आयातमुप instead of उपायतम् '<i>vayu</i> and thou <i>Indra</i>, ye heroes, come ye both quickly to the <i>soma</i> of the worshipper by this sincere prayer.'",
    "14082": "As:-- इन्द्र वायू इमे सुता उप प्रयोभिरागतम् ॥ इन्दवो वा मुशन्तिहि (<i>Rig</i>. I. 2. 4). \"<i>Indra</i> and <i>vayu</i>, here are <i>soma</i> libations for you. Approach, ye with pleasures for us. For the libations are desiring you.\" Here उप is separated from the word आगत by the intervening word प्रयोभिः.",
    "14083": "These particles govern a substantive and qualify a verb and differ from other particles termed <i>upasarga</i> and <i>gati</i>. As सुस्तुतं भवता well praised by you. सु सिक्तं भवता you have sprinkled. Here सु is a <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> and qualifies the sense of the verb, i. e. it is an adverb. It is not an <i>upasarga</i>, for had it been so, it would have changed the स into ष [[8.3.65]]. The term <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> is a big term compared with other technical terms such as, टि, घि, घु &c., which generally do not exceed more than two syllables. The word <i>karmapravachaniya</i> is not however merely a technical term; it contains within itself a definition of itself. It means that which qualities or speaks about (प्रोक्तवन्त) an action (कर्म) is so called.",
    "14084": "The word <i>lakshana</i> means a sign; an attendant circumstance an invariable concomitant or accident in its logical sense and not merely an occasional concurrence. The force of अनु in this case is that of 'after,' 'in consequence of,' 'because of, or being indicated by.' As जपमनु प्रावर्षम् it rained after or in consequence of the muttering of prayers. To put it in other words, <i>anu</i> is a <i>karmapravachniya</i> when it governs the word which indicates the cause or the attendant circumstance of an action.\n\nSo also शाकलस्य संहितामनु प्रावर्षत् = शाकल्येन सुकृतां संहितामनुनिशम्य देवः प्रावर्षत्. The God (clouds) rained having listened to the well performed reading, by <i>Sakalya</i>. The force of a <i>karmapravachaniya</i>, therefore, when fully analysed will be found to be that of an <i>upasarga</i> whose verb is not expressed in the sentence but is understood; and because of its being so understood, the particle itself seems to govern the noun which in fact was governed by the unexpressed verb. Thus in the above example संहितां is in the accusative case, apparently governed by the preposition अनु, but really governed by the verb अनुनिशम्य understood.\n\nSo also अनडुद् यज्ञमन्वसिंचत्. The Taurus sprinkled water after the sacrifice, अगस्त्यमन्वसिंचत् प्रजाः the people began sprinkling water after the rising of the canopus.\n\nWhy make unnecessarily this <i>sutra</i>, when अनु would have been called <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> even by force of sutra [[1.4.90]] following, where also the word <i>lakshana</i> occurs? This is for the sake of indicating that the <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniyas</i> should always govern the accusative case [[2.3.8]] even in expressing हेतु [[2.3.23]]. Otherwise Rule 23rd of the third chapter of Book II would have set aside Rule 8 of the same by the maxim of परत्व (1. 3. 2): and would have caused a <i>karana</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> to govern an Instrumental case where the sense was that of <i>hetu</i>.",
    "14085": "The meaning of अनु in this case will be that of 'with' or along with. As नदीमनु अवसिता सेना the army lying along side the river. पर्वतमनु अवसिता सेना lying along the slopes of the mountain.",
    "14086": "The word हीन means 'inferior,' and being a comparative term requires the other term with which comparison is made and which is superior; to complete the sense. In other words अनु governs the person to which others are inferior, in the accusative case. As अनुशाकटायनवैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to <i>Sakatayana</i>.'",
    "14087": "That is when the sense is that of 'over, above,' or 'inferior' as उपखार्यां द्रोणः a <i>Drona</i> is above a <i>khari</i>. उप निष्के कार्षापणः a <i>karshapana</i> is more than a <i>Nishka</i>. In this sense उप governs the Locative of the thing which is inferior [[2.3.9]]. So also उप शाकटायनं वैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to <i>Sakatayana</i>.' In this sense उप governs the accusative case.",
    "14088": "The force of अप and परि is in this case that of 'with the exception of.' As अपत्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः it rained outside of or with the exception of <i>Trigarta</i>. So also परि त्रिगर्तेभ्यो वृष्टोदेवः. In this sense they govern the noun excluded in the ablative case [[2.3.10]]. When not having these senses, they are not <i>karma</i>-<i>pravachaniya</i>. As ओदनं परिषिञ्चति. He waters the rice. Here it is an <i>upasarga</i>, and hence changes the स into ष.",
    "14089": "The word वचन in the text shows that both sorts of limits are here meant. As आपाटलिपुत्राद् वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (but excluding) <i>Pataliputra</i> आपाटलिपुत्रं वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (including) <i>Pataliputra</i> आकुमारं यशः पाणिनेः आसांकाश्यात्, आमथुरायाः when it means 'little' or is a verbal prefix it does not get this name.",
    "14090": "As (1) वृक्षं प्रति-परि or अनु विद्योतते विद्युत् 'the lightening is flashing in the direction of the tree.' (2) साधुर्देवदत्तो मातरं प्रति—परि = अनु '<i>Devadatta</i> is a good man as regards his mother.' (3) हरं प्रति हलाहलं 'the poison fell to the share of <i>Hara</i>.' यदत्रमां प्रति स्यात् that it may fall to my share. So with परि and अनु. (4) वृक्षं वृक्षं प्रति सिञ्चति he sprinkles one tree after another. So with परि and अनु.",
    "14091": "The illustrations given under the last <i>sutra</i> <i>mutus</i> <i>mutandi</i> apply here also, with the exception of those given under head (4). As वृक्षमभि विद्योतते; मातरमभि &c. But it is not <i>karma</i>-<i>pravachaniya</i> when भाग is meant. भाग means the share which is allotted to one as his own. As यदत्रममाभिष्यात् तद् दीयताम् give that which falls here to my share. Here <i>abhi</i> is an <i>upasarga</i>, and therefore स of स्य is changed into ष.",
    "14092": "That which is like to the principal is called प्रतिनिधि. Giving in return for what is obtained, is प्रतिदान. As अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति <i> Abhi</i>-<i>manyu</i> is the representative of <i>Arjuna</i>. माषानस्मै तिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति he exchanges <i>Mashas</i> for these sesamum. In these senses <i>prati</i> governs the Ablative (II. 3. 11.)",
    "14093": "As कुतोऽभ्यागच्छति whence has he come? Or कुतः पर्या गच्छति. These words though mere surplusages, have been called <i>karmapravachaniya</i> so that they may not get the designation of <i>upasarga</i> or <i>gati</i> and thus produce results peculiar to those words.",
    "14094": "As सुसिक्तं भवता, सु स्तुतं भवता excellently sprinkled by your honor. Well praised by your honor. By not ष being an <i>upasarga</i>, it does not change the स into [[8.3.65]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when respect is meant'? Observe सुषिक्तं किं तवात्र has this your place been well sprinkled to-day.",
    "14095": "The word अतिक्रमण means to do more than what is necessary for the accomplishment of an object. The force of च in the aphorism is to draw in the word पूजायाम् from the last. As अतिसिक्तमेवा भवता. It has abundantly been sprinkled by your honor, अतिस्तुतमिव भवता so also अतिस्तुतं भवता excellently praised by your honor. अति सिक्तं भवता.",
    "14096": "The word पदार्थ means the sense of another word which is not expressed but has to be supplied. As सर्पिषोऽपि स्यात् there may be perhaps a drop of ghee मधुनोऽपि स्यात्. Here some word like <i>vindu</i> 'a drop,' <i>stoka</i> 'a little' <i>matra</i>, 'a measure' &c., has to be understood. The word संभावन means possibility, a supposition. As, अपि सिंचेत् मूलकसहस्रं क्षणेनैकेन possibly may sprinkle a thousand trees in one moment; अपि स्तुयाद् राजानं he may praise possibly, a king. In the above cases it is used with the potential mood. अन्वसर्ग means indifference on the part of the speaker where he permits another to do as he likes. It is used with the Imperative mood. As अपि सिंच you may sprinkle if you like. अपि स्तुहि you may praise if you like. The word गर्हा means censure, contempt or reproof. As धिक्जाल्मं देवदत्तमपि सिंचेत् पलाण्डुम्. The word समुच्चय means cumulative. As अपि स्तुहि—अपि सिंच praise as well as sprinkle.\nIn all the above instances, the word not being an <i>upasarga</i>, does not change the स into ष.",
    "14097": "The word ईश्वर means 'master,' and it therefore requires another correlative word denoting 'property' of which one is master. The word <i>adhi</i> governs a Locative case. Sometimes locative of the person possessing, sometime locative of the property possessed: as अधि ब्रह्मदत्ते पंचालाः or अधि पंचालेषु ब्रह्मदत्तः. <i>Brahmadatta</i> rules over <i>Panchalas</i>.",
    "14098": "As यदत्र मामधि करिष्यति. Here the word अधि may be treated either as a गति or a कर्मप्रवचनीय. When it is a गति the accent will be regulated by <i>Sutra</i>. [[8.1.71]]; otherwise not.",
    "14099": "The word लः is in the genitive case, and means 'of ल.' The word आदेश 'substitutes' must be supplied to complete the sense. The term ल is a generic word for verb in general, viz., लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लेट्, लोट्, लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ्. The substitutes of ल are the well known personal terminations by which the verbs are conjugated in those tenses. Namely the following.\n\n<i>PARASMAIPADA</i>.\n\n- 3rd person - तिप्, तस्, झि\n- 2nd person - सिप्, थस्, थ\n- 1st person - मिप्, वस्, मस्\n\nAnd the affixes शतृ and क्वसु [[3.2.107]], and [[3.2.124]], and [[3.4.78]].",
    "14100": "The following are the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes:--\n\n- 3rd person - त, आताम्, झ\n- 2nd person - थास्, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person - इट्, वहि, महिङ्\n\nAnd the affixes भाव and ज्ञान [[3.2.106]],",
    "14101": "Of the 19 conjugational affixes, above given; 9 are <i>Parasmaipadi</i> and 9 are <i>Atmanepadi</i>. Each of these two classes is subdivided into three classes, according to person, as shown in the above list.",
    "14102": "Of the six triads thus formed, each is divided according to number into three classes, viz., singular, dual, and plural.",
    "14103": "The <i>sup</i> or the case-affixes by which nouns are declined are 21 in number corresponding to the seven cases, see <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.2]]. They also have three numbers singular, dual and plural.",
    "14104": "The word विभक्ति means a complete triad. Thus सप्तमी विभक्ति means the three affixes of the seventh case, i.e., the locative singular, dual, and plural. So प्रथमा विभक्ति means the third person, singular, dual, and plural.",
    "14105": "This defines the 2nd person of conjugational affixes. As त्वं पचसि thou cookest or पचसि; युवां पचथः or पचथः you two are cooking; यूयं पचथ or पचथ you cook.",
    "14106": "The word प्रहास means joke, sport. As एवं मन्ये ओदनं भोक्ष्यसे इति; नहि भोक्ष्यसे, भुक्तः सोऽतिथिमिः. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice,' thou shalt not eat, that has been eaten by a guest. एहि मन्ये रथेन यास्यसि नहि यास्यसि, यातस्तेन ते पिता. I think thou wilt go by the chariot, no, thou wilt not, thy father has gone before thee on it. When joke is not intended, the proper persons should be used: as, एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice.'",
    "14107": "This is clear. As अहं पचामि I cook, or merely पचामि-आवां पचावः or merely पचावः.",
    "14108": "As पचति he cooks, पचतः they two cook. पचन्ति they cook.",
    "14109": "When words are in <i>sanhita</i>, they are glued together by the rules of <i>sandhi</i>. As दद्ध्यत्र = दधि + अत्र.",
    "14110": "The word <i>avasana</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.15]] &c.",
    "21001": "This is a <i>paribháshá</i> or interpreting aphorism. Where ever in this Grammar a पदविधि is found, that must be understood to apply to समर्थ words. A rule relating to पद or complete words is called पदविधि. The word विधि is formed by adding वि to the root धाम्; that which is ordained (विधीयते) is called विधि. What are those rules which are ordained with regard to complete words? They are as follows.-(1) Rules relating to समास or compounding of words; (2) Rules relating to विभक्ति or the application of declensional and conjugational affixes; (3) and the rule by which one word is considered as if it had become a constituent member of another word (पराङ्गवद् भाव).\n\nThe word समर्थ means capable; that is to say, that which is capable of expressing the sense of a sentence on analysis, is called समर्थ ; or the word\/ समर्थ may mean that which depends upon words as connected in sense; that is to say, a rule relating to words whose senses are connected together.\n\nThus it will be taught in sútra 24 'a word ending with the second case-affix is optionally compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत &c. and forms <i>tatpurusha</i> compound;' as, कष्टं श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'who has had recourse to pain'. But when these words are not समर्थ or connected in sense there can be no compounding; as, पश्य देवदत्त कष्टं, श्रितो विष्णुमित्रो गुरुकुलम् see O <i>Devadatta</i>, the pain, <i>Vishnumitra</i> has taken recourse to his teacher's house. Here the words कष्टं and श्रितं though read in juxtaposition are not compounded, as they are not समर्थ.\n\nSimilarly, it will be taught in <i>sútra</i> 30 'a word coding with the 3rd case-affix is optionally compounded with what denotes that the quality of which is instrumentally caused by the thing signified by what ends with the 3rd case-affix and with the word अर्थ wealth; as, शङ्कुलया + खण्डः = शङ्कुलाखण्डः 'a piece cut by nippers.' Here also when the words are not connected in sense there is no composition; as, करिष्यसि शङ्कुलया, खण्डो देवदत्त उपलेन 'thou shall do it with the nippers, <i>Devadatta</i> is cut by the stones.'\n\nSimilarly, <i>sútra</i> 36 declares, ' a word ending with the 4th case-affix, is compounded optionally with what denotes that which is for the purpose of what ends with the 4th case-affix, and so too with the words, अर्थ, बलि &c.\n\nThus यूपाय + दारु = यूपदारु' wood for a stake.' But when these words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, गच्छ त्वं यूपाय,दारु देवदत्तस्य गेहे  ' go thou for the stake, the wood is in <i>Devadatta's</i> house.'\n\nSimilarly, <i>sútra</i> 37 declares 'a word ending with the 5th case-affix may be compounded with the word भय; as, वृकेभ्यो भयं = वृकभयं ' fear by reason of a wolf. But when these words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, गच्छ त्वं मां वृकेभ्यो, भयं देवदत्तस्य यज्ञदत्तात् 'come thou to me from the wolves, there is fear to <i>Devadatta</i> from <i>Yajñadatta</i>'.\n\nSimilarly, <i>sútra</i> [[2.2.8]] declares \"a word ending with the 6th case affix is optionally compounded with what ends with a case-affix;\" as, राज्ञः पुरुषो = राजपुरुषः 'the king's man'. But when the words are not समर्थ , there is no composition: as भार्य्या राज्ञः, पुरुषो देवदत्तस्य \"the wife of the king, the man of <i>Devadatta</i>\".\n\nSimilarly, <i>sútra</i> 40 declares. \"A word ending with the 7th case-affix is optionally compounded with the word शौण्ड  'skilled;' as, अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः 'skilled in dice.' But when the words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, शक्तस्त्वमक्षेषु शौण्डः पिबति पानागारे ' thou art skilled in dice, the gambler drinks in the tavern.'\n\nWhy have we used the word पद  'a complete word' in the <i>sútra</i>? So that this समर्थ परिभाषा may not apply to वर्णविधि i.e. rules relating to letters.\n\nThus rules of सन्धि 'conjunction of letters' are वर्णविधि and not पदविधि; and therefore the condition of being connected in sense, does not apply here. Two words however disconnected in sense, must be glued together by the rules of <i>sandhi</i>, if those rules are applicable. Thus <i>sútra</i>  [[6.1.77]] declares: 'instead of a letter denoted by the <i>pratyahara</i> इक् there is one denoted by the <i>pratyahara</i>  यण् , in each instance, where one denoted by the <i>pratyahara</i> अच् immediately follows;' . as,  दधि + अशान = दध्यशान. This substitution of य for इ will take place, whether the words are in construction or not, as  तिष्ठतु दध्यशान त्वं शाकेन  'let the curd remain, eat thou with the vegetable curry'. So also तिष्ठतु  कुमारीच्छत्रं हर देवदत्तात् 'let the girl be, take the umbrella from <i>Devadatta</i>'. Here the augment तुक् (त subsequently changed into च) comes between कुमारी and छत्र, though the two words are not connected in sense [[6.1.76]].",
    "21002": "In other words, the word ending in a case-affix enters, as if, into the body of the vocative <i>(ámantrita)</i> word; as it will be taught in <i>sútra</i> [[6.1.198]] which declares 'a word ending in a vocative case-affix, gets the <i>udátta</i> accent on the beginning i.e. first syllable'. Now, this rule will apply even when a word ending with a case-affix precedes such word in the vocative case. Thus the word पती 'O two lords !' has <i>udatta</i> on the first syllable. Now, when this word is preceded by another inflected noun as शुभस् of prosperity, the accent will fall on शु, the two words being considered as a single word; as:-\nअश्विना यज्वरीरिषो द्रवत्पाणी शुभस्पती | पुरुभुजाचनस्यतम || Rig. I. 3. 1.\n\"O <i>Asvins</i>, riding on quick horses, lords of prosperity, and bestowers of plenty of food, eat the sacrificial offerings to your satisfaction\". So also in the following: कुण्डे नाटन् 'O thou wandering with a bowl'. परशुना वृश्चन् 'O thou cutting with an axe.' मद्राणां राजन् 'O thou king of Madras.' कश्मीराणां राजन् 'O thou king of <i>Kashmir</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say 'a word ending with a case-affix?' If the preceding word ends with any other affix than a case-affix, this rule will not apply. As a पीड्ये पीड्यमान 'O thou who art pained, I am pained because of this thy pain.'\n\nHere पीड्ये 'being a तिङन्त (a verb)' is not considered as an anga of the vocative word.\n\nWhy do we say \"when followed by a word in the vocative case ?\" This rule will not apply when the subsequent word is not a vocative. As गेहे गार्ग्यः ' <i>Gárga</i> is at home.'\n\nWhy do we say 'of the subsequent?' It will not be a part of the vocative word which precedes. As देवदत्त कुण्डे नाटन्  'O <i>Devadatta</i> wandering with a bowl' Here कुण्डेन has not become part of <i>Devadatta</i>, but of the subsequent word अटन् .\n\nWhy do we say 'an <i>anga</i> or component part?' Both must be considered as one word for the application of the rule of accent, so that the first syllable of each word separately may not get the <i>udátta</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'as if or  वत्.' It is not altogether the body of the subsequent word; rules depending upon its own separate independent existence also take effect.\n\nThus rule [[8.1.55]] declares 'a word ending in the vocative case is not <i>anudátta</i> when it follows the word आम् there intervening a word between itself and आम्;' as, आम् कुण्डेन नाटन् ! Here <i>kundena</i> is considered a separate word for the purposes of Rule [[8.1.55]] and is said to intervene between आम् and the vocative word अटन् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'for the purposes of the application of rule of accent?' For the purposes of the application of any other rule, it will not be the <i>anga</i> of the subsequent word; as, कूपे सिञ्चन् 'O thou sprinkling in the well.' चर्म नमन्. Here had कूपे and चर्म been the <i>angas</i> of the subsequent words for all purposes, their स and न would have been changed into च and ण respectively by Rules [[7.4.2]] &c.\n\nVart:-When a word ending in a case-affix becomes, as if, the component part of the subsequent word, it becomes so even when there are several words in apposition with it which intervene between it and the vocative word ; because that, of itself, does not constitute want of immediate ness. Thus तीक्ष्णया सूच्या सीव्यन् 'O thou sewing with a sharp needle' तीक्ष्णेन परशुना वृश्चन् .\n\nVart:-Prohibition must be stated of indeclinable words. As उच्चैरधीयान  'O thou reading loudly. नीचैरधीयान.",
    "21003": "Thus it will be stated. 'The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. \n\nThe word <i>prák</i> is employed for the same purpose as it was used in [[1.4.56]] that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.",
    "21004": "In this aphorism the word ay is understood from <i>sutra</i>, so that it consists of three words vis, सुप्, सह, सुपा. All these three words jointly and severally, one at a time or two at a time, should be understood as governing the succeeding aphorisms, as the contingency of each <i>sutra</i> may require. This aphorism will constantly be applied in translating the <i>sutras</i> that follow.\n\nWhy have we used the word सह? Well, without it the <i>sútra</i> would have stood thus: सह सुपा'a noun may be compounded with another noun.' But this overlooks the case of a compounding with a verb. The word is therefore used so that we may be able to break this composite <i>sútra</i> into two separate and simple <i>sútras</i>, namely:-\n\n(1). सह, सुप्, समस्यते समर्थेन' a case-ipflected word may be com. pounded with a word with which it is connected in sense'. Here the word or with the help of the three words सुप् taken from <i>sútra</i> 2, समस्यते from <i>sútra</i> 3, and समर्थेन from <i>sútra</i> i, forms one complete aphorism, and applies to compounds like अनुव्यचलत् अनुप्रावर्षत . The accent will depend upon these being considered as <i>samasa</i>.\n\n(2). सुपा सह समस्यते a case-inflected word is compounded with another sup-inflected word. The compound which does not fall within any of the various sorts of compounds to be treated of hereafter, will fall under this general head of compounds; as, पुनरुत्स्यूतं वासो  देवं पूनर्निष्ठतो स्थः.. This also is for the sake of accents.",
    "21005": "This is also an  <i>adhikara</i> aphorism like the last. As far as <i>sūtra</i> 21, the compounds treated of, will get the designation of <i>Avyayibhava</i>. The word अव्ययीभाव like the word कर्मप्रवचनीय is a self-descriptive term, and not an arbitrary term like डि,धि  &c. When that which was not an indeclinable becomes an indeclinable, it is called stain or 'becoming an indeclinable'. In the <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound the sense of the first of its elements is the main one or the independent one on which the other depends.",
    "21006": "The words and so are understood in this <i>sútra</i>. The word 47 should be read as connected with every one of the above phrases.\n\n1.विभक्तिवचन;- As अधिस्त्रि कथा वर्तते' a story relatiog to\nwomen.' अधिकारि relating to a girl.'\n\n2. समीपवचन; - As उपकुम्भम् 'near to the jar.'उपमणिकं'  near to the gem.'\n\n3. समृद्धिवचन;- As सुमद्रं 'well or prosperous with the Madras'; सुमगधं 'well with the <i>Magadh</i>.'\n\n4. व्यृद्धिवचन;- As दुर्गवादिकं \"ill with the <i>Gavadikas</i> ;\" दुर्यवन ' ill with the <i>Yavanas</i>.'\n\n5. अभाववचन;- As निर्मक्षिकम्  'free from flies;' निर्मशकं 'free from mosquitoes'.\n\n6. अत्ययवचन ;- As निर्हिमम् 'on the departure of the cold weather';  निःशीतमं .\n\n7. असम्प्रतिवचन;- As अतितैसृकम् 'past (not now) the time of wearing quilts'.\n\n8. शब्दप्रादुर्भाववचन;-  As इति हरि 'the exclamation <i>Hari</i>' (thus वैष्णवगृहे इति हरि वर्तते 'in the house of the <i>Vaishnava</i> there is the cry of <i>Hari</i> <i>Hari</i>').\n\n9. पश्चाद्वचन;- As अनुरथं पादातम् 'the infantry after the chariots.'\n\n10. यथार्थवचन;- The meaning of the word यथा is four-fold, viz. correspondence, severalty  or succession, the not passing beyond something, and likeness; thus (1) अनुरूपम् 'in a corresponding manner.' (2) प्रत्यर्थम् 'according to each or several object or signification'. (3) यथाशक्ति ' according to one's ability'.\n\n11. आनुपूर्व्यवचन;- As अनुज्येष्ठं प्रविशन्तु भवन्तः 'let your honors enter in the order of seniority.'\n\n12. यौगपद्यवचन;- As सचक्रं धेहि  'simultaneously with the wheel.'\n\n13. सादृश्यवचन;  As ससखि  'like a friend.'\n\n14. सम्पत्तिवचन;- As सक्षत्रम्  'as warriors ought.' \t\n\n15. साकल्यवचन; As सतृणम्  'even to the grass' it, the whole, not leaving even a scrap. \n\n16. अन्तवचन;- As  साग्नि as far as the chapter of fire (i.e. the whole <i>Veda</i>).",
    "21007": "Thus यथावृद्धम् ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व  invite every old <i>Brahmana</i>. So also यथाध्यापकम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not signifying likeness?'. For there is no composition when likeness is indicated. As यथादेवदत्तस्तथा यज्ञदत्तः  As is <i>Devadatta</i>  so is <i>Yajñadatta</i>.\n\nThis <i>samása</i> could have been included in the last <i>sútra</i> clause to, but making a separate <i>sútra</i>  shows that the word यथार्थवचन there must be limited by the present <i>sútra</i>, to first three meanings of the word यथा given there and not to its fourth meaning. vis. there is no compounding when it means likeness.",
    "21008": "The word अवधारण means accurate ascertainment, restriction or limitation. As, यावदमत्रं ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व invite so many <i>Bráhmanas</i> only and not more as there are pots': i.e., if there are five pots then invite five <i>Bráhmans</i>; if six pots, then invite six <i>Bráhmans</i>. \n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning limitation'? Observe यावद्दत्तं तावत् भुक्तम् 'I ate so long as it was given to me,' i.e. I do not know for certainty how much I have eaten.",
    "21009": "The word नाना means a drop,' 'a little,'  'wee bit;' as, शाकप्रति \"a little of vegetable,' सूपप्रति 'a little of soup.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a little'? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतते विद्युत् 'it lightens in the direction of the tree.' Here it is not compounded.\n\nThough the word <i>sup</i> was, by <i>anuvritti</i>  from <i>sútra</i> 2, understood in this <i>sútra</i>, its repetition in the text is for the purpose of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word अव्यय which began with <i>sútra</i>  6 does not extend further into the subsequent <i>sútra</i>.\n\nThe word प्रतिना being exhibited in the 3rd case-affix is not an <i>upasarjana</i> (l.2.43) and therefore, it comes as the last member of the compound [[2.2.30]].",
    "21010": "This समास is restricted to terms applicable to gambling. Thus there is a game called <i>panchiká</i> which is played with fire dice or five ivory pieces When all these five pieces fall with faces turned upward, or all with faces turned down, then the thrower wins the game. But when the fall is otherwise, he loses. Thus अक्षपरि 'an unlucky throw of dice. शलाकापरि, an unlucky throw of ivory pieces '; so also एकपरि 'an unlucky throw by one over' द्विपरि, त्रिपरि  and lastly चतुष्परि.' This is the maximum.' But when Eve are of one form, then of course, he wins.",
    "21011": "This is an <i>adhikára</i> <i>sútra</i>. All the rules of compounding given hereafter, are optional. The same sense can he expressed by the uncompounded words as by them when compounded. But not so are the compounds which have been treated of, before. Compounds like , सुमद्रं, यथाबद्धं, अक्षपरि &c. mentioned above arc invariable compounds (नित्य समास), the sense conveyed by the compound term, not being capable of analysis, by taking the senses of the separate members of the compounds, or at least not capable of expressing any sense without inserting extraneous words on analysis.",
    "21012": "As अपत्रिगर्तम् दृष्टो देवः  or अपत्रिगर्तेभ्यो दृष्टो देवः 'it rained away from <i>Trigarta</i>'. So also, परित्रिगर्तम् or परित्रिगर्तेभ्यः 'round about <i>Trigarta</i>,'बहिर्ग्रामम् or बहिर्ग्रामात् 'outside the village' प्राग् ग्रामम् or प्राग् ग्रामात् 'east of the village.'\n\nWords formed from the verb अञ्चु  'to go,' are उदञ्च 'north' प्राञ्च  east, &c.\n\nFrom this <i>sútra</i> we learn by inference (<i>jñàpak</i>) that the word बहिः  also governs the ablative case (see II.3.29).",
    "21013": "As, आपाटलिपुत्रं or आपाटलिपुत्रात् दृष्टो देवः 'it rained up to <i>Pátaliputra</i>.' आकुकरं or आकुपरिभ्यो यशः पाणिनेः 'the fame of <i>Panini</i>  extends even to the boys.'",
    "21014": "The word <i>lakshana</i> means a sign goal. See also (1. 4. 84) and go for a further explanation of this word. As अभ्यग्नि or अग्निमभिलभाः पतन्ति 'the moths fall in the direction of fire.' So also प्रत्यभि or अग्निं प्रति, the sense being, that making the fire their aims (लक्ष्य) they fall towards it.  \n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning <i>lakshana</i>'? Observe स्रुग्घ्नं प्रति गतः 'he turned back and went towards <i>Srughna</i> i.e., having torned back he went only towards the direction of <i>Srughna</i> but not to that place itself.\n\nWhy do we say the words <i>abhi</i> and <i>prati</i>? Observe येनाग्निस्तेन गतः 'he went in the direction of the fire' .\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning direction towards'? Observe अभ्यङ्का गावः or प्रत्यङ्कागावः 'the recently marked cows.'",
    "21015": "As, अनुवनमशनिर्गतः 'the thunder bolt fell near the forest.'\n\nWhy do we say अनु ? Observe वनं समया 'near the forest.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when compounded with the word, nearness to which is indicated'? Observe वृक्षमनु विद्योतते विद्युत् 'it lightens towards the tree.'\n\nThough this compounding was valid even by <i>sūtra</i> 6, because nearness is mentioned there also; it is repeated here in order to show that an <i>Avyayibháva</i> compound mentioned here is an optional compound after all, and not an invariable compound like others.",
    "21016": "As, अनुगङ्गं वाराणसी 'the city of <i>Benares</i> extends alongside the river Ganges' अनुयमुनं मथुरा  <i>Mathura</i>, alongside of the <i>Yamuna</i>, the length of <i>Mathura</i> being measured by that of the <i>Yamuna</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say 'length'? Observe वक्षमनु विद्योतते विद्युत्.",
    "21017": "The words तिष्ठद्गु, &c. are all irregularly formed <i>Avyayibhava</i> compounds. Most of these words are epithets of various times. The force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is restrictive, that is to say these words always form the <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound and nothing else. They are as follows :-तिष्ठद्गु, वहद्गु, आयतीगवम् , खलेयवम्, खलेबुसम् , लूनयवम् , लूयमानयवम् , पूतयवम् , पूयमानयवम् , संहूतयवम् , संह्रियमाणयवम् , संहूतबुसम्, संह्रियमाणबुसम् , समभूमि , समपदाति , सुषमम् , विषमम् , दुष्षमम् , निष्षमम् , अपरसमम् , आयतीसमम् , प्राह्णम् , प्ररथम् , प्रमृगम् , प्रदक्षिणम् , अपरदक्षिणम् , सम्प्रति , असम्प्रति, पापसमम् , पुण्यसमम् , इच् कर्मव्यतिहारे- (V.4.127.) e.g., कचाकचि ।।",
    "21018": "Ordinarily these words would have formed Possessive <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds. The present <i>sûtra</i> ordains <i>Avyayibhåva</i> instead. The force of वा in the text is that the Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounding also takes place in the alternative. As पारेगङ्गम् or गङ्गापारम् 'across the Ganges.' मध्येगङ्गम् or गङ्गमध्यम् 'middle of the Ganges.'\n\nOf course according to the option allowed by <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.11]], this compounding need not take place at all, the same sense being expressed by a phrase; as पारं गङ्गायाः or मध्यं गङ्गायाः .",
    "21019": "The word वंश means uninterrupted descent of persons from a common source whether through birth or knowledge. A succession of teachers and pupils, of ancestors and descendants, &c., would constitute a वंश 'family.' One born in or belonging to such a वंश is called a वंश्य or descendant.\n\nAs, दिमुनि व्याकरणस्य 'of the <i>Vyakarana</i>,' which has two sages as its principal expounders viz., <i>Panini</i> and <i>Patanjali</i>. So, त्रिमुनिव्याकरणस्य 'having three representatives viz., <i>Pånini</i>, <i>Patanjali</i> and <i>Sakatayana</i> or <i>Katyayana</i>.'\n\nWhen we desire to express their equality as regards knowledge, then both the words are put in the same case: as द्विमुनि or त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम् .\n\nSo also when the relationship is by birth: as, एकविंशति भारद्वाजम् Twenty-one <i>Bharadwajas</i>. These a subsequent compounds are like <i>Dvigu</i>.",
    "21020": "According to <i>Patanjali</i> this refers to their Aggregate (समाहार); as सप्तगङ्गम् ' at the meeting of the seven <i>Ganges</i>,' द्वियमुनं 'at the meeting of the two <i>Yamunas</i>,' पञ्चनदं' where the five rivers meet'. सप्तगोदावरम् 'where seven <i>Godavaris</i>' meet.",
    "21021": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>samkhyå</i> does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. Though this rule is given in the sub-division relating to optional compounds it is, however, a <i>Nitya-samasa</i> rule : for no Name (सञ्ज्ञा) can ever be expressed by a sentence, and that being so, these compounds can never be analysed. As उन्मत्तगङ्गम् ' the country called <i>Unmatta Ganges</i> .' So also लोहितगङ्गम्, कृष्णगङ्गम् ; शनैर्गङ्गम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it denotes a thing other than that expressed by the component parts of the compound' ? Observe कृष्णवेण the 'river <i>Krishnavena</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when it expresses an Appellative' ? Observe शीर्घो गङ्गो देशः ' the country where the <i>Ganges</i> moves rapidly.'",
    "21022": "From this <i>sutra</i> as far as the <i>sutra</i> [[2.2.23]] relating to <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds, the word <i>Tat-purusha</i> should be read into each <i>sutra</i>. This  big term is of older coinage than that of <i>Panini</i>, being, in fact, made by older grammarians. In the <i>Tat-purusha</i> compound, the sense of the last of its elements is the main one, and governs the preceding one. The <i>Karmadhåraya</i> (Appositional Determinative Compound) and <i>Dwigu</i> (Numeral Determinative Compound) are also sub-divisions of this class of compounds. The rest of this chapter and 22 <i>sůtras</i> of the second, deal with this.",
    "21023": "The object of making <i>Dwigu</i> a sub-division of <i>Tat-purusha</i> Compound is that the समासान्त affixes and rules given in (V. 4. 68-160) should apply to <i>Dwigu</i> also. Otherwise we could well have dispensed with this <i>sutra</i>; as <i>sútra</i> 52 of this chapter already defines <i>Dwigu</i>. Thus पञ्चराज्ञ [[5.4.91]] fem. पञ्चराज्ञी (IV. I. 15., 21), 'an aggregate of 5 princes' द्ववहः, '[[5.4.89]], पञ्चगवम् 'an aggregate of 5 cows.' दशगवम् 'an aggregate of ten cows.' (V. 4. 92.)",
    "21024": "As कष्टं+ श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'who has had recourse to trouble.' , नरकश्रितः, So also :- कान्तारातीतः 'who has passed over the dreary forest.', नरकपतितः, 'fallen into hell.' आमगतः 'gone to village.' तरङ्गात्यस्तः 'passed the waves.' सुखप्राप्तः  'who has reached pleasure.' सुखापन्नः 'who has obtained happiness.'\nThe words गमी, गामी &c., should also be included. As ग्रामगमी, ग्रामगामी; ओदन बुभुक्षुः .",
    "21025": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वितीया from the last aphorism into this, cannot take place; though, however, it is understood in the next <i>sūtra</i>. The word स्वयम् being an Indeclinable, cannot take any case-affix. As स्वयै धौतौ पदौ 'feet washed by himself' स्वयं विलीनमज्यम्.\n\nIn this compounding, the two words do not appear to have undergone any change after their composition. They are the same as they were before the composition. But by calling their juxtaposition, 'a compound,' two indirect advantages are gained. Namely these two words are regarded as one word, and their accent is also similarly regulated. See Rule (VI. I. 223).\n\nThe words ending in <i>kta</i> which is a <i>Nistha</i>. affix, are past participles.",
    "21026": "The word क्षेप means 'censure,' 'blame' and this sense can be connoted only by the compound word as a whole and not by any of its constituent elements. This compound is also, therefore, a <i>Nitya</i> Compound, though it occurs in the sub-division relating to Optional Compounds :-because it is impossible to analyse such a compound and express, by means of sentence, the sense conveyed by the function of the compound word.\n\nAs खट्वारूढः or खट्वाप्लुतः (literally lying on a bed); silly, stupid, going wrong or astray.\n\nThere is no compounding when 'censure is not meant.' As खठ्वामारूढः 'lying on a bed.'\n\nWhy this word should have this opprobrious meaning, will be understood from the consideration of the following facts :-a person under the <i>Aryan</i> social polity, could only then enter the married state or the life of a house-holder, as it was called, when he had completed his <i>Brahmacharya</i> i.e., the prescribed period of bachelor studentship. All <i>Brahmacharis</i> were bound to sleep on ground and not on खट्वा or cots, so long as they were <i>Brahmacharis</i>. A person who without completing his studies, and without obtaining the permission of his teacher, entered into matrimony, was originally called, in reproach, खट्वारूढः 'who had ascended the couch in an improper way.' Then the term was extended to all persons guilty of vile action.",
    "21027": "The word सामि being an <i>avyaya</i>, and not denoting any substance, cannot take the affixes of the second or any case. Therefore the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वितीया would be inapposite in this aphorism.\n\nAs सामिकृतम् 'half-done.' सामिपीतम् 'half-drunk' सामिभुक्तम् 'half-eaten.'\n\nThe object attained by this <i>samása</i> is the same as in [[2.1.25]], namely, making them one word and taking one accent.",
    "21028": "This rule applies when duration of time is not connoted by the compound, which is provided for, in the next aphorism. The word for कालाः does not mean here, as it would otherwise mean by <i>Sutra</i> I. 1. 68, the word- from काल but special words denoting काल.\n\nAs मासप्रभितश्चचन्द्रमाः 'the new moon,' (literally, the moon that has begun to measure the month). Similarly, अहस्सङ्क्रान्ताः, रात्रिसङ्क्रान्ताः applied to six <i>Muhurtas</i> (of 48 minutes each) which are called चर and अचर which sometimes occur in day time (in the summer month) and sometimes in the night (in the winter).",
    "21029": "The word काल is understood in this aphorism; but not so the phrase 'ending with the affix क्त.'\n\nThe word अत्यन्तसंयोग means 'uninterrupted connection.' For accent of these words see (VI. 2. 2.)\n\nAs मुहूर्तसुखम् 'a momentary pleasure.' सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना.",
    "21030": "The words सुप्, सुपा are understood here: and the whole of this <i>sutra</i> is an epithet of those words. A noun in the instrumental case is compounded with a word expressing quality, and with the word अर्थः provided that the word expressing quality is itself the result produced by the sense of the word in the instrumental case शङ्कुलयाखण्डः शङ्कुलाखण्डः 'cut by nipper' किरिकाणः 'made blind of one eye by a hog' धान्यार्थः 'wealth acquired by grain.' For accent of these words see (VI. 2. 2.)\n\nWhy do we say 'when caused by the word in the instrumental case'? Observe अक्ष्णा काणः 'blind of one eye.' Here अक्ष्णा in the 3rd case is not the instrumental cause that produced blindness and hence no compounding.\n\nWhy do we say 'a word expressing quality ?' Observe :- गोभिर्वपावान् 'sowing with the cows.' Here though 'sowing' is instrumentally caused by the Cows, yet it does not qualify cows but the sower, and hence no compounding. \n\n<i>Guna-vachanas</i> are those words which, not being words formed by primary or secondary affixes, or other words entitled to the name of <i>samkhya</i>, or <i>sarvanama</i>, or <i>jati</i>, or compound words, are words denoting qualities and capable of being used as adjectives qualifying substantives.",
    "21031": "From this <i>sutra</i>, we learn incidentally that the words पूर्व, &c., govern the instrumental case.\n\nAs, मासेन पूर्वः = मासपूर्वः 'prior by a month,' संवत्सरपूर्वः 'prior by a year,' मातृसदृशः 'like the mother,' पितृसदृशः 'like the father,' मातृसमः 'similar to the mother,' पितृसमः 'similar to the father,' माषोनम्, माषविकलं 'less by a <i>masha</i>, असिकलहः'a fight with the swords,' वाक्कलहः 'bandying words.'वाग् निपुणः 'proficient in speech,' आचारनिपुणः 'proficient in the observances of sacred duties,' तिलमिश्रः — गुडमिश्रः 'mixed with sesamum or jaggery' आचारश्लक्षणः 'polished in behaviour.' \n\nVart :-The word अवर should be enumerated in the list, as मासावरः 'later than a month.'",
    "21032": "The word बहुलं shows that there is a general relaxation of all the rules and conditions. As अहिना हतः = अहिहतः 'killed by the snake' नखनिर्भिन्नः 'divided by the nails.' परशुच्छिन्नः' cut by the axe.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the agent or the instrument'? Observe भिक्षाभिरुषितः 'dwelt with alms.' Here the force of the 3rd case is that mentioned in <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.21]] and not that of (II. 3. 18.)'\n\nWhy do we say 'diversely'? Observe दात्रेण लूनवान् 'cutting with the sickle.' परशुना छिन्नवान् 'cutting with the axe. Here there is no compounding. But there is compounding where otherwise there ought not to be, because of the word बहुलः-- as पादहारकः and गले चोपकः .",
    "21033": "As काकपेयानदी 'a shallow river' (so shallow that a crow may dip his beak into it and touch the bottom and drink). श्वलेह्य कूपः 'a shallow well' (so that a dog can lick water from the brink of it). वाष्पच्छेद्यानि तृणानि 'thin grass' (so fragile that it can be cut by vapour) कण्टकसञ्चेय ओदनः .\n\nThis <i>sūtra</i> is in a way a prolongation of the last .\n\nVart:-The phrase 'words ending in a <i>kritya</i> affix' must not be taken universally, only the <i>kritya</i> affixes यत् and ण्यत् are meant in the above <i>sutras</i>. The following are the <i>kritya</i> affixes :- तव्य, अनीय, यत्, क्यप्, ण्यत्, (see <i>sutra</i> III. 1.95-132). Therefore there is no compounding when the word ends in तव्य as in काकैः पातव्या.",
    "21034": "That which is to be prepared is called अन्न, and that which prepares is व्यञ्जन; a, दध्योदनः = दध्ना उपसिक्त ओदनः 'rice prepared or made relishable with curd.' So also क्षीरौदनः. The words 'food' and 'condiment' as represented in the above compounds, are connected in sense by a verb understood.",
    "21035": "Anything eatable, whether hard or soft, is called भक्ष्य; its refinement is called मिश्रीकरणं. As गुडधानाः  'barley prepared with jaggery;' गुडपृथकाः  'flattened parched rice prepared with jaggery.' \n The connection here also between the two words is established by a verb understood.",
    "21036": "The words सुप, सुपा are understood in this <i>sutra</i> and the whole <i>sutra</i> qualifies these words. \n\nBy the expression तदर्थ 'for the purpose thereof,' the special relation of a material and its modification alone is by Patanjali here held to be intended. As यूपाय दारुः = यूपदारुः 'wood for stake' (that is wood which by modification will be changed into a stake). कुण्डलहिरण्यं 'gold for ear-ring.' But not so here. रन्धनाय स्याली 'pot for cooking.' अवहननायोलूखलम् 'the wood mortar for threshing. From this <i>sûtra</i> we may also infer that the Dative case conveys also the sense of 'for the purpose thereof.' The word तदर्थार्थ is taken as one word by some, meaning 'a thing serviceable thereto.' See VI. 2. 44. For accent, see VI. 2. 45.\n\nVart:- With the word अर्थ the compound so formed is a <i>Nitya</i> compound (an invariable compound) and agrees in gender with the word which it qualifies; as, ब्राह्मणार्थम् पयः 'milk for the sake of <i>Brahmans;' and ब्राह्मणार्था यवागूः 'gruel for the Brahmanas.' So also कुवेरबलिः 'a sacrifice for </i>Kuvera_' महाराजबलिः 'a sacrifice for the great Raja.' गोहितं ' what is good for cows.' अश्वहितं 'what is good for horses' गोसुखं 'what is pleasant for cows' गोरक्षितं 'what is kept for cows,' (as grass).",
    "21037": "The phrase सुप् सुपा is understood here, and the <i>sutra</i> qualifies it.\n\n As वृकेभ्यो भयं=वृकभयं 'fear from wolves,'  चौरभयं 'fear from thieves,' दस्युभयं 'fear from robbers.'\n\nVart:- So also with the words भीत, भीति, and भीः as वृकभीतः, वृकभीतिः, वृकभीः.\nThis <i>sutra</i> is an expansion of <i>sûtra</i> 32 and an exposition of the word बहुल there. So that we may have the following compounds also: ग्रामनिर्गतः 'gone out of the village.' अधर्म जुगुप्सुः .",
    "21038": "As, सुखापेतः 'gone away from pleasure.' कलपनापोढः 'carried away by imagination' चक्रमुक्तः 'freed from the wheel.' स्वर्गपतितः 'fallen from heaven.' तरङ्गापत्रस्तः 'afraid of the waves.' This is an expansion of (II. 1. 32.)\n\nBy using the word अल्पशः 'in a gradual degree,' is shown the limited range of this kind of compounds. Not every ablative word can be so compounded. Hence there is no compounding at all in the following cases :- प्रासादात् पतितः, 'fallen from the mansion.' भोजनादपत्रस्तः 'afraid of eating.' For here the fall &c., is violent and sudden, and not gradual and slight.",
    "21039": "As स्तोकान्मुक्तः 'loosed from a little distance.'\n\nSo also अन्तिकादागतः 'come from near' अभ्याशादागतः 'come from near' दूरादागतः 'come from far, विप्रकृष्टादागतः 'come from a distance.' कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तः 'saved with difficulty.' कृच्छ्रन् लब्धः 'obtained with difficulty.'\n\nBy rule [[6.3.2]] the case-affix is not elided in compounds of this kind.\n\nVart:- The words शत 'a hundred' and सहस्र 'a thousand' are similarly compounded with the word पर. As, शतात्परे = परश्शताः 'beyond a hundred:' So also परसहस्राः 'beyond a thousand.' In these examples the word शत and सहस्र being exhibited in the 1st case and thus being <i>upasarjana</i> ought to have stood as the first member of the compound [[2.2.30]]; But these compounds are supposed to fall under the class of राजदन्त &c, [[2.2.31]] and hence the <i>upasarjana</i> stands as the second member of the compound. Irregularly is also the augment स (सुद्) interposed between these two words.",
    "21040": "The word शौण्डैः in the <i>sútra</i> being in the plural number indicates a class of words beginning with <i>šaunda</i>.\n\nAs, अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः 'skilled in dice' अक्षधूर्तः 'cunning in dice' अक्षकितवः 'a gamester in dice.'\n\nThe following is the list of शौण्डादि words:-1 शौण्ड, 2 धूर्त, 3 कितव, 4 व्याड, 5 प्रवीण, 6 संवीत, 7 अन्तर् when meaning place, 8 अधि, 9 पटु, (or अधिपटु), 10 पण्डित, 11 कुशल, 12 चपल, 13 निपुण, 14 संव्याड, 15 मन्य, and 16 समीर.",
    "21041": "As, साङ्काश्यसिद्धः 'perfect in Sánkásya.' काम्पिल्यसिद्धः 'perfect in Kampilya.' आतपशुष्कः 'dried in the sun.' छायाशुष्कः dried in the shade.' स्थालीपकः 'cooked in pot.' कुम्भी पक्वः 'cooked in an earthen jar.' चक्रबन्धः 'bound on the wheel.' For their accent see (VI. 2. 32.)\n \nThese are also further illustrations of the word as in <i>sútra</i> 32.",
    "21042": "As, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षः 'a crow at the sacred bathing place' i.e., a very greedy person; as a crow in a bathing place does not remain long, any where, so a person who goes to his teacher's house and does not tarry there long, is called a तीर्थकाकः or a तीर्थवायसः.\n\nWhen it has not this meaning, there is no compounding: as, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षस्तिष्ठति 'There is a crow in the sacred bathing place.'",
    "21043": "This compound is confined to the words formed by the <i>kritya</i> affix यत् and not to every <i>kritya</i>-formed word.\n\nAs, मासदेयम् 'a debt repayable within a month.' So संवत्सरदेयं 'payable within a year.' त्र्यहदेयं 'repayable within three days.'\n\nBy using the word ऋण we indicate by implication any appointed time in general, and not merely a time for the payment of a debt. Therefore we get compounds in the following cases also:- पूर्वाह्नो गेयं साम 'the <i>Sáma</i> that should be sung in the morning.' प्रातरध्येयोऽनुवाकः 'the chapter that should be studied in the morning.'\n\nWhy do we say 'debt'? Observe मासे देया भिक्षा 'the alms that should be gives each month.'",
    "21044": "A <i>sanjña</i> is expressed by the complete word, hence it is an invariable (<i>nitya</i>) compound; for we cannot express an appellative by a sentence.\n\nAs, अरण्ये तिलकाः 'wild sesamum' yielding no oil; anything which does not answer to one's expectation. So also अरण्ये माषाः, वने किंशुकाः' anything found unexpectedly.' So also वने बिल्वकाः, कूपे पिशाचकाः.\n\nThe case-affix is not elided, in this case, in accordance to <i>sútra</i> (VI. 3. 9.) (The 7th case-affix is not elided after words ending in consonants or in short अ when the compound denotes appellative.)",
    "21045": "As, पूर्वाह्णकृतम् 'done in the morning.' अपराह्णकृतम् 'done in the afternoon.' पूर्वरात्रकृतम् 'done in the first part of the night.' अपररात्रकृतम् 'done in the last part of the night.'\n\nWhy do we say 'members or divisions of day and night?' Observe अहनि भुक्तम्  'eaten in the day' रात्रौ वृत्तम् 'occurring in the night.'\n\nThis being a continuation of <i>sútra</i> [[2.1.32]], we have diversely रात्रिवृत्तम् and सन्ध्यागर्जितं.",
    "21046": "Thus तत्रभुक्तम् 'eaten there.' तत्रकृतं 'done there,' तत्रपीतं 'drunk there.' By making this a compound, the same purpose is served as in <i>sútra</i> [[2.1.25]] namely, these two words form one word and get one accent.",
    "21047": "As, अवतप्तेन कुलस्थितं त एतत् 'they are as if an ichneumon standing on hot ground (metaphorically said of the inconstancy of man) चापलम्।।\n\nSo also उदके विशीर्णम् 'dried in water,' (figuratively used for any thing unheard of or impossible.)\n\nSo also प्रवाहे मुत्रितम् (lit.) 'making water in a stream,' (fig.) 'doing a useless action.' भस्मनि हुतम् 'offered oblation in ashes,' (fig.) 'a fruitless action.'\n\nThe 7th case-affix is not elided in the case of this <i>sútra</i> also. See <i>sútra</i> (VI. 3. 14.)",
    "21048": "The words like <i>pátre</i>-<i>sammita</i> 'a dish-companion' (a parasite), &c., are <i>Tat-purusha</i> compounds, when contempt is implied.\n\nAll these are irregular compounds. Some of the words contained in this list are compounds formed with the past-participle (क्त); they could have been formed by previous aphorism also. Their inclusion in this list is for the purpose that their first member should have <i>udatta</i> on the beginning; because all the words belonging to this class, are a subdivision of a larger class called 'युक्तारोह्यादि Class' treated of in <i>sútra</i> (VI. 2.81.)\n\nThe following is the list of the words:- 1 पात्रेसम्मिताः, 2 पात्रेबहुलाः, 'a parasite' (constant at meals or dinner time). 3 उदुम्बरमशकः, 4 उदुम्बरकृमिः, 5 उदरकृमिः, 6 कूपकच्छपः, 7 अवटकच्छपः, 8 कूपमण्डूकः, 9 कुम्भमण्डूकः, 10 उदपानमण्डूकः, 11 नगरकाकः, 12 नगरवायसः, 13 मातरिपुरुषः, 14 पिण्डीशूरः, 15 पितरिशूरः, 16 गेहेशूरः, 17 गेहेनर्दी, 18 गेहेक्ष्वेडी, 19 गेहेविजिती, 20 गेहव्याडः, 21 गेहेमेही, 22 गेहेदाही, 23 गेहेदृप्तः, 24 गेहेधृष्टः, 25 गर्भेतृप्तः, 26 आखनिकबकः, गोष्ठेशूरः, 28 गोष्ठेविजिती, 29 गोष्ठेक्ष्वेडी, 30 गोष्ठेपटुः, 31 गोष्ठेपण्डितः, 32 गोष्ठेप्रगल्भः, 33 कर्णेटिरिटिरा, 34 कर्णेचुरुचुरा।।",
    "21049": "The phrase सुप् सुपा is understood here, the whole <i>sútra</i> qualifying it.\n\nWords which separately can be applied to many distinct and different objects, when they apply to one common object, are said to be in apposition (समानाधिकरणं) or abiding in a common substratum.\n\nln the present <i>sútra</i> the word-form <i>púrva-kála</i>, is not to be taken [[1.1.68]] but its significates; while of the rest एक &c., the very word-form is to be taken. A word denoting action which naturally precedes in time, is compounded with a word denoting action which naturally succeeds it. As, स्नातानुलिप्तः 'bathed and perfumed' कृष्टसमीकृतम् ' ploughed and levelled.' दग्धप्ररूढम् 'burnt and healed.' एकशाटी 'having one petticoat.' एकभिक्षा 'begging once in a day.' सर्वदेवाः 'All gods.' सर्वमनुष्याः 'all men.' जरद्धस्ती 'old elephant.' जरद्गृष्टिः 'an old cow.' जरद्वृत्तिः 'old occupation.' पुराणान्नम् 'old rice.' पुराणावसथम् 'an old habitation.' So नवान्नम्; नवावसथम्; केवलान्नम् 'only rice.'\n\nWhy do we say when they are in the same case? Observe एकस्याः शाटी 'one's petticoat.'\nThese and the subsequent compounds are <i>Karmadháraya </i> Compounds [[1.2.42]].",
    "21050": "The phrase 'being in apposition,' is understood in every one of these <i>sútras</i> up to the end of the chapter.\n\n- As पूर्वेषुकामशमी 'the town of <i>Ishukamasami</i> -in-the-east.' अपरेषुकामशमी the town of <i>Ishukamasami</i> -in-the-west.' पञ्चाम्राः 'the five mangoes' सप्तर्षयः 'the seven-sages' (the constellation of the Great Bear),\n\nWhy do we say 'when the sense is that of an appellative ?' Observe उत्तरा वृक्षाः 'northern trees.' पञ्च ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' See (IV. 2. 107.)",
    "21051": "First let us take the case where the sense is that of a <i>Taddhita</i>-affix. Thus when a compound is formed out of the words पूर्वस्यां शालायां भवः 'that which is in the eastern hall' (in which analytical exposition of the compound in question, the word भव [[4.2.107]] serves to represent the force of a <i>Taddhita</i> -affix) the compound having reached the form of पूर्वा+शाला, the feminine termination of the पूर्वा is rejected, because <i>Patanjali</i> declares that the masculine state belongs to a pronominal when exercising any of the five functions belonging to a word; we have :-पूर्व + शाला + अ [[4.2.107]] = पौर्वशालः (VII. 2. 117 and VI. 4.148) 'who is in the eastern hall.'\n\nSo also when an additional member comes after the compound (<i>uttarpade</i>) As, पूर्वशालप्रियः or अपरशालप्रियः 'loving the eastern or western hall.' Those <i>Uttarpada</i> Compounds are invariable (<i>Nitya</i>) compounds, so that they can not be resolved into their component elements.\n\nWhen a समाहार  'aggregate' is to be expressed, it is of course impossible to use a word expressing points of the compass ( दिक् words ). The following compounds are formed with numbers (सङ्ख्या), when employed with the force of a <i>Taddhita</i> affix; as, पाञ्चनापितिः 'relating to five barbers.' पाञ्चकपाल 'relating to an oblation offered in five cups' (कपाल) [[4.1.88]]. So also पञ्चगवधन [[5.4.92]] 'Whose wealth consists of five cows,' दशगवधनः\n\nThe following are examples of aggregates:- पञ्चफली 'the collection of five fruits' [[4.1.21]] दशपूली 'an aggregate of ten bundles,'त्रिलोकी 'the aggregate of the three worlds.' पञ्चकुमारि 'an aggregate of five virgins;' this word is neuter by (II. 417.)and the long ई is shortened by (I. 2. 47.)",
    "21052": "First to take an example of <i>Taddhitartha</i>:-as, पञ्चेषु कपालेषु संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः 'an offering prepared or offered in five cups.' So also दशकपालः 'prepared in tea cups.' These are names of <i>Purodása</i> offerings; and are formed by adding the affix अण् in the sense of 'refining an object of food' by sūtra [[4.2.16]]; then this affix is elided (लुक्) by [[4.1.88]].\n\nTo take an example when an additional member comes after the compound. As पञ्चनावप्रियः loving five ships. द्विनावरुप्यम् money which has come by two ships' (द्वि+नौ+टच् [[5.4.99]] = द्विनाव)\n\nOf an aggregate we have पञ्चपूली. The feminine is formed by [[4.1.21]].",
    "21053": "As वैयाकरणसूचि 'a bad or dull grammarian.' Here it might be asked is the word व्याकरणं 'grammar' a word of contempt, or the word वैयाकरण 'grammarian'? Neither 'Grammar' (it being a part of <i>Vedanga</i>,) nor the person who studies it i.e., the grammarian, can be an object of contempt ordinarily.\n\nThe word 'grammarian' is, however, the expression of contempt in an indirect way, thus :- The person studying grammar but not studying it well, becomes an object of contempt and such a despicable person becomes also contaminated. The word खसूचि is a term of contempt per se. It literally means, a person who on being asked a question, and not possessing ready wit and intelligence to answer it, scratches his head and contemplates vacancy (खंसूचयति) and tries to divert the questioner's attention by exclaiming 'how beautifully clear is the sky,' such a person is called खसूचिः.\n\nSuch compounds are confined to cases where the reason for the use of any particular term is to express contempt with regard to the signification of that term. So we can not form a compound of the sentence वैयाकरणश्चौरः 'the thief grammarian;' for, contempt is not expressed with regard to the signification of the word 'grammarian.' But when the term 'grammarian' itself is used in a contemptuous signification, then a compound will be formed.\n\nThis aphorism is commenced in order to introduce an exception to <i>sútra</i> 57, by which an adjective stands as the first member in a compound. By the present <i>sútra</i>, however, the attributive word will stand as the second member.\n\nOther examples of such compounds are: याज्ञिककितवः 'one who hankers after performing sacrifices for persons for whom one ought not to perform sacrifices' मीमंसक-दुर्दुरूढः 'an unbelieving logician,' 'an athiest.'\n\nNo compound can be formed under this aphorism, if both the words are not used in an opprobatory signification as such. Therefore it is not in the following case. कुत्सितोब्राह्मणः 'the bad Brahmana' &c.",
    "21054": "Both the words पाप and अणक are words of contempt (कुत्सन) ; by the last <i>sútra</i>, they would have stood as second members in the compound; the present <i>sútra</i>, however, is so framed with regard to <i>sútra</i> [[1.2.43]] and [[2.2.30]], that they will stand as first. As पापनापितः or अणकनापितःः 'a contemptible barber' पाप or अणक-कुलालः 'a contemptible potter.'",
    "21055": "That by or to which a thing is compared is '<i>upamana</i>' and the '<i>upameya</i>' (the thing compared) is called सामान्य or 'common'. Thus घनश्याम कृष्णः 'cloud-black Krishna' (Krishna black as a cloud). Here श्याम is a quality common to Krishna and cloud: therefore 'cloud' which is the उपमान is compounded with it. So also कुमुदश्येनी 'lily-white.' हंसगदग्दा 'Swan-sounding' न्यग्रोध-पारिमण्डला 'globular as <i>Nyagrodha</i> tree.' For accent see [[6.2.2]].\n\nBut not so in देवदत्ता श्यामा 'black <i>Devadatta</i>' or फला इव तन्दुलाः 'the rice are like fruits' पर्वता इव बलाहकाः 'clouds like mountains'.",
    "21056": "This is a modification of <i>sůtra</i> 57, by which the objective would have stood first; by the present, the attribute stands second. As पुरुषोऽयं  व्याघ्र इव = पुरुषव्याघ्रः 'a person-tiger' (in strength) पुरुषसिंहः\n\nIn the last <i>sutra</i>, the compounding was between the उपमान  and the common quality. In the present, the compounding is between the उपमित  and certain उपमान but never with सामान्य वचन. Therefore we can not form this kind of compound from the following sentence:- पुरुषो व्याघ्र इव शूरः 'a man strong as a tiger.' Similarly मुखपद्मम्, मुखकमलं, करकिसलयम्, पार्थिवचन्द्रम्॥\n\nThe words व्याघ्र  &c. are आकृतिगणः  i. e., this is a class of compound words, the fact of a word belonging to which, is known by its form, a posteriori and is not discoverable by any consideration of its constituent parts a priori.\n\nThe following is the list of such words:-  1. व्याघ्र  = A tiger. 2. सिंह  = A lion. 3. ऋक्ष = A bear. 4. ऋषभ = A bull. 5. चन्दन = Sandal. 6. वृक = A wolf. 7. वृष = A bull!. 8. वराह = A boar, hog. 9. हस्तिन = An elephant. 10. तरु  = A tree. 11. कुञ्जर = An elephant. 12. रुरु = A kind of deer. 13. पृषत = The spotted antelope. 14. पुण्डरीक = A lotus flower. 15. पलाश  = A tree Butea Frondosa. 16. कितव = A rogue, cheat.\n\nआकृतिगणोऽयम्\n\n1. मुखपद्मम्     A lotus-like face.\n2. मुखकमलम्     A lotus-like face.\n3. करकिसलयम् = Sprout-like hand, a tender hand. 4. पार्थिवचन्द्रः .",

The very fact that a special rule has been made for the compounding of genitive cases governed by <i>krit</i>-nouns, shows that other words which take genitive case by some special rule, are not so compounded.

In fact the genitive case ordained by any rule of Panini, other than [[2.3.51]], is a '<i>pratipadavidhana</i>' genitive; and a word taking genitive case according to those rules, is incapable of composition; see <i>vårtika</i> under [[2.2.10]].",

Thus सर्वेषां श्वेततरः = सर्वश्वेतः 'the whitest of all.' सर्वेषां महत्तरः = सर्वमहान्  'the greatest among all.' This '<i>vartika</i>' is an exception in anticipation to the next <i>sutra</i> which prohibits composition, when the genitive has the force of specification. Thus सर्वशुक्ला गौः 'a cow whitest among all.'",
    "22010": "With this sutra, begins a series of exceptions to the composition of words in the genitive case.

This form of genitive meaning 'amongst,' is ordained by <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.41]].\n\nVart:- A word taking a genitive-case by force of any rule other than <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.50]], is never compounded. See <i>sutra</i> 8. Thus the following words are never compounded सर्पिषोज्ञानम् , मधुनोज्ञानम्.",
    "22011": "The word '<i>artha</i>' joins with all the first three words, as (1) छात्राणां पंचम. 'fifth amongst the pupils;' छात्राणां दशम.

When however the affix is तव्यम् having the indicatory त् (III. 1. 96.) there is compounding as ब्राह्मणकर्तव्यं  'the <i>Brahmana's duty' (7) राज्ञः पाटलिपुत्रकस्य 'of the king </i>Pataliputraka<i>' पाणिनेः सूत्रकारस्य 'of the </i>sutra<i> composer </i>Panini<i>. We can however form a compound like the following a सूत्रकारपाणिनिः । By the general rule relating to words in apposition contained in </i>sūtra<i> [[2.1.57]], the difference between that </i>sutra_ and the present, is as to position of the words. In the genitive compound the genitive word would have stood first if compounded; not so in the other, there the quality stands first.",
    "22012": "The affix क्त is added in the sense of inclination, understanding or respect by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.188]]. The present <i>sutra</i> alludes to that aphorism when it uses the word पूजाः and puja itself is used only as an illustration and includes the other two significations of '<i>kta</i>' also, namely <i>mati</i> 'inclination,' and buddhi 'understanding.'\n\nAs राज्ञां मतः -बुद्धः - पूजितः 'the king wishes, understands or respects.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning respect'? When '<i>kta</i>' has not this signification there is compounding. As छात्रहसितं 'pupil's laughing.'",
    "22013": "When the affix क्त is attached to roots denoting 'fixedness, motion or eating', it gives the sense of agent and of location in connection with the action denoted by the roots i.e., that the action is located by the agent in this or that site [[3.4.76]]; as इदमेषां यातम् ' here they have gone.'  इदमेषां भुक्तम् 'here they have eaten.'",
    "22014": "The anuvritti of क्त does not extend to this aphorism. The word karma qualifies <i>shashthi</i>. <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.66]] declares the conditions when, instead of the accusative, the genitive may be employed i. e., when the agent and the object of the action denoted by the nouns formed by <i>krit</i> affixes, are both used in a sentence, the object is put in the genitive case and not the agent; as आश्चर्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of cows without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन  'eating of rice agrees with Devadatta.' साधु खलु पयसः पानं देवदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by Devadatta is indeed excellent.' विचित्रा सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनिना 'wonderful is the structure of sutras by Panini.",
    "22015": "The word '<i>kartari</i>' qualifies the genitive-case. The affix तृच् is taught in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.133]], and the affix अक is not a single affix; all affixes that have an element वृ are अक such as ण्वुवुल् or वुञ्  ओर् वुन् ( <i>sutra</i> (VII. 1. 1.) ) Thus भवतः शायिका 'your honor's repose' भवत आशिका 'your eating' भवतोऽग्रगामिका 'your going in front.'\n\nThe affix तृच् is employed always in forming nouns of agency; hence there can be no example of a word in a genitive case having the force of an agent, governing another word also having the force of an agent. They therefore serves no purpose in this aphorism, but applies to the <i>sutra</i>s that follow.\n\nThe genitive has the force of an agent under conditions mentioned in [[2.3.65]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when it denotes agent'? Observe इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि .",
    "22016": "The word '<i>kartari</i>' qualifies the word '<i>aka</i>' only and not '<i>trich</i>,' for the latter always denotes the agent and nothing else.\n\nAs अपां क्षष्टा 'the creator of waters' पुरां भेत्ता 'the destroyer of cities' वज्रस्य भर्ता 'the holder of thunderbolt.'\n\nIt might be suggested that the word भर्तृ being read in the class of याजक (sutra 9) ought to be compounded. The word भर्तृ there means 'husband,' while in the example we have given, it means 'holder.'\n\nThe above are examples of words formed by तृच्. Now we shall give examples of words formed by अक, thus ओदनस्य भोजकः 'the eater of rice,' सक्तूनां पायकः 'the drinker of <i>saktu</i>.'",
    "22017": "This is a Nitya-samasa incapable of analysis. This anuvritti of the word 'na' which began with <i>sútra</i> 10, does not extend further. The affix तृच्  never has the sense of sporting or livelihood; the only examples possible are of '<i>aka</i>.' Thus उद्दालकपुष्पभजिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which <i>uddalaka</i> flowers are broken or crushed.' So also वारणपुष्पप्रचायिका 'a play of gathering flowers.'\n\nSo also दन्तलेखकः 'one who earns his bread by painting or marking the teeth.' नखलेखक 'a nail-painter by profession.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning sporting or livelihood.' Observe ओदनस्य भोजकः.",
    "22018": "The word <i>ku</i> means 'badness or sin' ; as, कुपुरुषः 'a sinful man' ; (2) <i>Gati</i> [[1.4.60]] as, उररीकृतं 'having asserted'; (I. 4. 61.) यदूरीकरोति ॥\n\nSo also with the words प्र &c., when they are mere particles and not used as 'upasargas,' or 'gati'; as दूर् meaning 'bad,' in दुष्पुरुषः 'a bad man'; so also सु and अति meaning 'respect' in सुपुरुषः 'honorable man'; अतिपुरुषः 'excellent man' ; आ means 'a little' as आपिङ्कत्नः 'brownish.'\n\nGenerally these are attributive words but they are found elsewhere also, as कोष्यं or कदुष्णम् or कवोष्णन् 'tepid.' So also दुष्कृतम्, अतिस्तुतम् and आबद्धम् ॥",
    "22019": "Thus कुम्भकारः 'one who wakes pots,' नगरकारः 'one who makes cities.'\n\nWhy do we say 'which does not end with a tense-affix'? Observe एधानाहारको व्रजति 'he goes to bring fuel.'\n\nIt might be objected, that the question of compounding with a word ending in a tense-affix is irrelevant; since the <i>anuvritti</i> of the words सुप् सुपा is understood here, so that तिङ्  will find no scope. To this we reply that we should infer that the words सुप् सुपा should not be read into this and the last aphorism. The following <i>Paribhasha</i> also arises from this <i>sūtra</i>.\n\nगतिकारको पपदानां कृद्धिः सह समासाचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः ॥\n\n\"It should be stated that <i>Gatis</i>, <i>Karakas</i>, and <i>Upapadas</i>, are compounded with bases that end with <i>krit</i>-affixes, before a case-termination or feminine affix has been added to the latter.\"\n\nThe result is that <i>Upapadas</i> and <i>Gatis</i> are rot compounded by <i>sūtras</i> 18 and 19 with case-infected nouns, but they are compounded with primary nouns before a case-termination or feminine affix is added to the latter. The same considerations apply to <i>karakas</i> also. Thus अश्वक्रीती 'a female brought in exchange for a horse,' is formed correctly. अश्वेन क्रीयते सा = अश्वक्रीत ; add ङीष [[4.1.50]] and we have अश्वक्रीती. If on the other hand, the feminine affix ate had beca added to क्रीत previous to its composition with अश्व the form would have been अश्वक्रीता, and we should have had no base ending with short अ and in that case ङीष् could not have been added by [[4.1.50]].",
    "22020": "This makes a restriction, to the general compounding of <i>upapadas</i> with <i>avyayas</i> as ordained by the last rule. As स्वादुकारं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats having made his food sweet.' So also लवणकारं 'having seasoned. The <i>avyayas</i> ending in अम् are formed by the affix ण्मुल् [[3.4.26]] &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'with <i>avyayas</i>       ending in अम्'?  Observe कालो भोक्तुम्  'the time of eating.' Here the <i>avyaya</i> ends in उम् of the affix तुमुन् added by rule [[3.3.167]] (the affix <i>tumun</i> may be applied, when the word in construction is not a verb, but काल, समय or वेला 'time.')\n\nThe force of the word only is to indicate that this composition takes place in those cases where a rule ordains अम् only, after any root with regard to any upapada; so that no composition will take place where the affix अम् as well as another affix is ordained after a root with certain <i>upapadas</i>. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.24]], declares: \"the affixes क्त्वा and णमुल् come after a verb when the words अमे, प्रथम and पूर्व are <i>upapadas</i>.\" Here the अम् (affix णमुल्) is not the sole affix ordained; but there is a co-ordinate affix with it namely क्त्वा. Therefore in अग्रेभोजम् 'having first eaten' there is no composition because अग्रेभोजम् is not the only form we can have; for, अग्रेभुक्त्वा is also used in the same sense.",
    "22021": "The term अम् is understood here. The <i>upapadas</i> ending with a third case-affix &c., are given in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.47]] and the sutras that follow. As मूलकोपदंशं मुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats after having relished the food with radish.' So also पार्श्वोपपीड or पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् शेते (Ill. 4. 49) 'he lies pressing on his ribs.' For <i>upapadas</i> ending with other cases, see <i>sutra</i>  [[3.4.52]] &c. This being an optional rule, it is not necessary that the <i>upapada</i> should be <i>tulya-vidhana</i> with the अम् ; so that this optional compounding may take place even under rule [[3.4.59]] where अम् is not the only affix enjoined, but there is क्त्वा as well. This <i>vibhasha</i> may therefore be called both प्राप्त and अप्राप्त <i>vibhasha</i>. It is प्राप्त with regard to those rules where अम् is the only affix employed; and it is अप्राप्त with regard to those where श्रम् is not the only affix.",
    "22022": "This rule provides for <i>avyayas</i> ending in क्त्वा which the last two rules did not provide. Thus we have उच्चैः कृत्य or उच्चैः कृत्वा. Here the affix क्त्वा is added by <i>sutra</i> (III. 4. 59.) In the case when there is composition, the क्त्वा is replaced by the substitute ल्यप्  ; otherwise not. See (VII. I. 37).\n\nThe condition of the <i>upapadas</i> being in the 3rd case &c., applies here also. Therefore there is no composition in अलं कृत्वा or खलु कृत्वा.",
    "22023": "A compound which does not fall within any one of the rules given above, will be <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. This is a governing aphorism and extends up to <i>sūtra</i> 28. Thus चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.'",
    "22024": "The <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound comes with the force of all the affixes but the first; as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामं = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः 'a water-reached village. ' ऊढरथोऽनड्वान्  'a bull by whom a cart is drawn.'  'उपहृतपशूरुद्रः 'Rudra to whom cattle is offered,' उदृतौदना स्थाली 'a vessel which rice is placed.' चित्रगुर्देवदत्तः 'Devadatta possessed of a brindled cow.' वीरपुरुषको ग्रामः 'a village possessed of heroic men.'\n\n<i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound is not formed with the sense of the first case. As वृष्टे देवे गतः 'gone when it had rained.'\n\nWhy do we say 'more than one'? So that there may be compounding of many words, as in the following verse:-\n\nसुसूक्ष्मजटकेशेन सुञभाजिनवाससा। पुत्री पर्वतराजस्य कुतो हेतोर्विवाहिता ॥.\n\n'Why was the daughter of the king of the mountains married by <i>Siva</i> possessed of beautifully-delicate-locked-hair, and cheap deer-skin-dress.'",
    "22025": "Thus उपदशाः [[5.4.73]] 'those who are near ten i.e. nine or eleven.' Similarly उपविंशः 'nineteen or twenty-one' [[6.4.142]]. So also आसन्नदशाः 'nine or eleven.' अदूरदशाः 'nine or eleven.' अधिकदशाः 'eleven.'\n\nSo also two 'numerals' may be compounded; as, द्वित्राः 'two or three.' द्विदशाः 'twenty.'\n\nWhy do we say with a numeral'? Observe पंच ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' \n\nWhy do we say 'with an Indeclinable &c'? Witness ब्राह्मणाः पंच. Why do we say 'when denoting a numeral'? Observc अधिका विंशतिर्गवाम्' of cows more than twenty.'",
    "22026": "Thus दक्षिणपूर्वादिक् <i>dakshina-purva</i>, 'south-east,' (the direction midway between south and east.) पूर्वोत्तरा 'north-east.'\n\nThe word नाम is introduced in the sūtra to indicate that no compounding takes place when the words denoting direction are derivative words whose primary signification is not indicative of direction; as ऐन्द्र्यश्चकौबेर्याश्च दिशोर्यदन्तरालम् ' the point between cast and north'. Here the words ऐन्द्री 'east' and कौबेरी 'north' though denoting directions, are derivatively so, and hence no compounding.",
    "22027": "The word तत्र means 'a word in the locative case,' and तेन 'a word in the instrumental case.' The word सरूप or 'similar form' applies to both. The word इति indicates that the meaning of the compound so formed should be learned from popular usage, therefore it means, 'seizing, striking, fighting.' All these senses are implied by इति. The word is exhibited in the locative case, if the sense is that of seizing; and the word is exhibited in the instrumental case, when the sense is that of striking; the word indicated by the word इदमिति is युद्ध; as केरोषुकेशोषु च गृहीत्वा इदं युद्ध वृत्तं = केशाकेशि [[6.3.137]] and (V.4. 127.) ' hair to hair, fighting by pulling each other's hair'; कचाकचि 'hair  against hair'; दण्डैश्च दण्डैश्च प्रहृत्य इदं युद्धं वृत्तं = दण्दादण्डि 'stick against stick, fight with stick and stave;' so also मूशलामूशली. In the above examples the samasanta affix is added at the end by rule [[5.4.127]]; and all such words are Aryaya or indeclinable. The final vowel of the first term is lengthened by Rule [[6.3.137]].\n\nWhy do we say 'having the same form'? We cannot form such a compound from the following : हलैश्च मुषलैश्च प्रहृत्य इदं युद्धं वृत्तम् .",
    "22028": "Thus सह पुत्रोणागतः=सपुत्रः ( [[6.3.82]], सह changed to स ) 'he has come accompanied by his son'. सच्छात्रः 'accompanied by the pupil.' सकर्मकरः 'accompanied by the servant.'\n\nWhy do we say '<i>tulya</i>-<i>yoga</i>'? Witness 'the she-ass carries the whole burden, though there exist her ten sons.'\n\nHow do we get the forms like  सकर्मकः, सलोमकः, सपक्षकः &c., in which there is no '<i>tulya</i>-<i>yoga</i>'? It shows that this condition is of limited operation (तुल्य गोगबचनं प्रायिकं).",
    "22029": "The meanings that may be indicated by च 'and' are four, (1) समुच्चयः 'community of reference,' (2) अन्वाचय 'collateralness of reference, (3) इतरेतरयोगः 'mutual conjunction' and (4) समाहारः  'aggregate.' In the first two cases viz., community of reference, and collateralness of reference, composition does not take place, because the words are not directly related to one another (II. I. I). Composition is enjoined therefore, when the sense of च is that of mutual conjunction and lumping. Thus we cannot compound ईश्वरं गुरुं च भजस्व 'reverence God and thy <i>Guru</i>' or भिक्षामट गां चानय 'go for alms and bring the cow.' But we can compound the following प्लक्षश्च न्यग्रोधश्च = प्लक्षन्यग्रोधौ 'the <i>Plaksha</i> and the <i>Nyagrodha</i> trees.' So धव-खदिर-पलाशाः , वाक्त्वचम्, वाग्दृषदम् ॥",
    "22030": "The word समासे is understood here. The <i>upasarjana</i> being the word exhibited in the nominative case in the rules relating to <i>samasa</i>, must stand first. The constant application of this rule has been illustrated in the previous aphorisms. Without this rule, there would have been no fixity as to the position of words.",
    "22031": "Thus राजदन्तः (दन्तानां राजा) 'a chief of teeth' (i.e., an eyetooth).

Where there are more than one such for words घि in a compound, any one may be fixed upon as first member, and the rest to follow no fixed rulc, As पटुमृदुशुक्लाः or पदुशुक्लमृदव्ः.\n\nWhy do we say '<i>Dvandva</i>'? Observe विस्पष्टपटुः which is Tat-purusha.",
    "22033": "Thus, उष्ट्रखरम् 'the camel and the ass.' उष्ट्रशशकम्  'the camel and the hare.'\n\nWhy do we say 'अत् with a त्' [[1.1.70]]? This rule does not apply when it is long आ as अश्वा + वृषः = अश्वावृषौ or वृषाश्वे .",

    "22035": "In a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, all words are <i>upasarjana</i>, and hence there is no rule for their arrangement. The present aphorism declares that rule; as कण्ठेकालः 'who is black in the throat'. So also उरसिलोमा, चित्रगुः, शवलगुः.",

Observe कडारपुरुषो ग्रामः 'a village of tawny men,' which is </i>Bahuvreehi_. Here ends the force of [[1.4.1]] and [[2.1.3]].",
    "23001": "Whatever will be taught from this point forward, should be understood to apply to those cases which have not been specified otherwise. The case-affixes like those denoting 'object' 'instrument' &c., are applied to a noun, only then, when the force of the case-affix is not otherwise denoted or mentioned or exhibited. The force of a case-affix may be so denoted either by first, the conjugational affixes तिङ्; secondly, by the Primary affixes or कृत्, thirdly, by the secondary affixes तद्धित; or lastly by compounds. Thus <i>sutra</i> 2 declares that the second case-affix is applied in denoting the object, as कटं करोति 'he makes the mat'; ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But the object can otherwise be denoted. Thus by the passive conjugational affix, as कृयते कटः 'the mat is made.' Here the termination of the verb denotes the object. See <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.18]]. and [[3.4.69]]. So also by the <i>krit</i> affix, as कृतः कटः 'the mat is made,' see <i>Sutra</i> [[3.4.70]]. So also by a <i>Taddhita</i> affix as शत्य or शतिकः meaning 'purchased with a hundred' = शतेन क्रीतः. Similarly by <i>samasa</i>, as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामम् = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः ॥",
    "23002": "The terms <i>dvitiya</i> &c., are technical phraseology of older grammarians, and hence not defined by <i>Panini</i>; they apply to the triads of सुप् affixes. कटं करोति 'he makes the mat,' ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village.'\n\nThe words उभयतः, सर्वतः, धिक् and the double forms उपर्युपरि, अधोधः, अध्यधि, when they have the sense of nearness, govern the accusative. Sometimes other cases also, as उभयतो ग्रामं 'on both sides of the village'; सर्वतो ग्रामं 'on all sides of the village'; धिग्देवदत्तं 'fie to <i>Devadatta</i>'; उपर्युपरि ग्रामम् 'just over the village'; अध्यधि or अधोधो ग्रामम् 'just below the village.'\n\nVart:- The words अभितः, परितः both meaning 'round', समया, निकषा both meaning 'near', and हा 'woe be to,' and प्रति 'to,' govern the accusative case; as, अभितो ग्रामम् 'round the village,' ग्रामं समया 'near the village'; हा देवदत्तं 'woe be to <i>Devadatta</i>'; बुभुक्षितम् न प्रतिभाति किंचित् 'to a hungry person nothing occurs to his mind.' See [[1.4.49]] &c.",
    "23003": "This ordains the third case-affix, and by force of the word च 'and' the second case-affix is also employed as यवाग्वाग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he satisfies or pleases <i>Agni</i> with barley-powder,' or यवागुमग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he throws barley-powder into the fire as oblation.'\n\nWhy do we say 'in the vedas?' In the classical Sanskrit, the accusative only must be used and not the instrumental.",
    "23004": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>dvitiya</i> is understand here and not that of <i>tritiya</i>. Both these words <i>antara</i> and <i>antarena</i> are <i>Nipatas</i>. They govern the accusative. This debars the genitive case. The word <i>antara</i> means 'between' while <i>antarena</i> means 'besides that,' 'without,' 'exception,' 'with reference to' 'regarding.' As, अन्तरेण पुरुषकारं न किंचिल्लभ्यते nothing can be gained without exertion. अन्तरा or अन्तरेण त्वां च मां च कमंडलुः 'the bowl is between thee and me.' कोऽन्यस्त्वां मां तरेण शक्तः प्रतिकर्तुम् 'who else but thee is able to retaliate.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when joined with ?' Observe अन्तरा तक्षशिलां च पाटलिपुत्रं स्रुघ्नस्य प्राकारः.",
    "23005": "मासमधीते 'he reads for a month,' 'he studies full one month,' मासं कल्याणी 'prosperous during the month' (uninterruptedly), संवत्सरं पुष्पाः 'flowers during the year continually,' क्रोशं कुटिला नदी 'the river winding for one <i>kos</i> without any break,' क्रोशं पर्वतः 'the hill through one full <i>kos</i>.' सभा वैश्रवणी राजन् शतयोजनमायता 'O king the hall of <i>Visravana</i> is 100 <i>yojanas</i> in length.'\n\nThe word अत्यन्तसंयोग or 'full continuity' means the complete relation of time or space with its action, attribute or substance.\n\nWhy do we say '<i>atyanta</i>-<i>sanyoga</i> or complete continuity'? Observe मासस्य द्विरधीते or क्रोशस्यैकदेशे पर्वतः ॥",
    "23006": "मासेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the <i>Anuvaka</i> in a month,' क्रोशेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the <i>Anuvaka</i> by going over a <i>kos</i>.\n\nThe word अपवर्ग means 'the finishing of an action, on the attainment of the object intended by the action, but not before.' Thus संवत्सरेणानुवाकोऽधीतः means '<i>Anuvaka</i> was persaveringly and effectually read by him in the whole year.'\n\nWhen the idea of <i>apavarga</i> is not intended, the accusative case is employed, as मासमधीतोऽनुवाकः 'learnt for a month, but not yet completed, the <i>Anuvaka</i>.'",
    "23007": "Ex. अद्य भुक्त्वा देवदत्तो द्व्यहे द्व्यहाद्वाभोक्ता 'having dined today, <i>Devadatta</i> will dine in or after two days.' Here the 'time' is the interval between the agent and his power of eating. So also इहस्थोऽयमिष्वासः क्रोशात् क्रोशे वा लक्ष्यं विध्येत् 'standing here, he will hit a mark at the distance of one <i>kos</i>. Here <i>kos</i> is the interval between the agent and the object or the object and the ablation, or the object and the location. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not apply here.",
    "23008": "Ex. शाकल्यस्य संहितामनुप्रावर्षत् 'It rained on (hearing) the reading of the <i>Veda</i> by <i>Sakalya</i>.' So also आगस्त्यमन्वसिंचत् प्रजाः ॥",
    "23009": "Ex. उपखार्याम् द्रोणः 'A <i>Drona</i> is more than a <i>Khari</i>,' अधिब्रह्मदत्ते पंचालाः '<i>Brahmadatta</i> is the lord of <i>Panchalas</i>.' The phrase यस्यचेश्वरवचनं indicate that both the thing owned and the owner may be in the locative. See (1.4.97).\n\nThis aphorism debars the accusative.",
    "23010": "Ex. अप or आ or परि पाटलिपुत्रादावृष्टो देवः 'It rained off or upto or with the exclusion of, <i>Pataliputra</i>.'\n\nThe परि here has the meaning of 'exclusion' [[1.4.88]] being read along with अप, therefore, not here वृक्षं परि विद्योतते विद्युत् [[1.4.90]].",
    "23011": "Ex. अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति '<i>Abhimanyu</i> is the representative of <i>Arjuna</i>.' माषानस्मैतिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति 'he exchanges <i>mashas</i> for this sesamum.' See [[1.4.92]] for an explanation of प्रतिनिधि and प्रतिदान.",
    "23012": "Ex. ग्रामं or ग्रामाय गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But not so in मनसा हरिं व्रजति (the verb not denoting physical motion) 'he goes mentally to <i>Hari</i>' अध्वानं गच्छति 'he goes over the way' (the object being the 'way'). But not so in ओदनं पचति 'he cooks rice;' (the verb not denoting 'motion') nor in अश्वेन व्रजति (the verb not denoting 'the object.')\n\nNote.- The word <i>adhvan</i> includes the synonyms of road (1. 1. 68) as पन्थानं गच्छति, मार्गं गच्छति.\n\nNote.- The prohibition applies with regard to the going over or occupying the road; so that where a person from a wrong road goes to the right road, there the fourth case-affix will be employed as पथे गच्छति.",
    "23013": "Ex. उपाध्यायाय गां ददाति 'He gives a cow to the teacher' देवदत्ताय रोचते 'it pleases <i>Devadatta</i>' [[1.4.33]] पुष्पेभ्यः स्पृहयति [[1.4.36]] 'he desires flowers.'\n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix should be employed when the sense is that of 'for the purpose thereof' as यूपाय दारु 'wood is for making posts.' कुण्डलाय हिरण्यं 'gold used for the purpose of making ear-ring.' रन्धनाय स्थाली 'pot for the sake of cooking.' अवहननायोलूखलं 'mortar for the sake of threshing.'\n\nVart:- The verb क्लृप and other verbs meaning 'to be fit or adequate for, result in, bring about, accomplish, produce, tend to,' govern the dative case: as, मूत्राय कल्पते यवागूः 'the barley gruel tends to produce urine.' So elso मूत्राय संपद्यते जायते वा यवागुः.  \n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix is employed with the force of 'indicating a portent or calamity.' as.\n\nवाताय कपिला विद्युदातपायाति लोहिनी ॥\nपीता वर्षाय विज्ञेया दुर्भिक्षाय सिता भवेत् ॥\n\n'The reddish lightening portends wind, extremely red indicates heat, yellow portends rain and white lightening prognosticates famine.'\n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix should be employed in connection with the word हितः as गोभ्योहितं 'good for cows.'",
    "23014": "In other words, when the sense of an infinitive of purpose formed by '<i>tumun</i>' and '<i>nvul</i>' (III. 3. 10,) is suppressed in a sentence, the object of this infinitive is put in the Dative case.\n\nफलेभ्यो व्रजति = फलान्याहर्तुं व्रजति 'he goes for fruits i. e., to bring fruits.' This debars the accusative case. So also we have in एधेभ्यः व्रजति 'he goes for fuel.' The words क्रियार्थोपदस्य and स्थानिनः are in apposition. The first is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound of क्रियार्थ + उपपद and means 'a verb whose <i>upapada</i> denotes the purpose of the action (<i>kriyartha</i>).' Thus in एधानाहर्तुम् 'to bring fuel'; the infinitive verb आहर्तुम् is क्रियार्थोपपद, the object of this verb is एधः when this verb is suppressed, it becomes स्थानिनः; the object of this verb takes the fourth case-affix.\n\nWhy do we say 'of the verb whose <i>upadada</i> denotes the purpose of the action'? Observe प्रविश पिंडीम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'in denoting the object.' Witness एधेभ्यो व्रजति शकटेन 'for fuel he goes with a cart.'\n\nWhy do we 'when suppressed'? Observe एधानाहर्तुं व्रजति.",
    "23015": "Ex. यागाय व्रजति 'he goes to offer a sacrifice' = यष्टुं व्रजति. So also त्यागाय व्रजति, भूतये व्रजति.\n\nThe word तुमर्थ means 'having the same significance as the affix तुम्.'",
    "23016": "Ex. नमो देवेभ्यः, स्वस्ति प्रजाभ्यः, स्वादाऽग्नये, स्वधा पितृभ्यः, अलं मल्लो मल्लाय 'Salutation to Gods'; 'peace to the people'; '<i>svaha</i> to fire'; '<i>svadha</i> to the <i>Pitris</i>'; 'an athlete is a match for an athlete' &c. The word अलं includes its synonyms also, as प्रभुः, शक्तः &c.; so वषडिन्द्राय, वषडग्नये.\n\nThe च indicates that the Dative will debar Genitive, in spite of [[2.3.73]], in the case of these words, though used benedictivley; as स्वस्ति गोभ्यो भूयात् ॥",
    "23017": "Ex. न त्वा तृणं तृणाय वा मन्ये 'I do not consider thee worth a straw.' न त्वा बुसं बुसाय वा मन्ये 'I do not consider thee worth a chaff.' Why do we use the word मन्ये? Observe न त्वा तृणं चिन्तयामि. The optional dative will not be employed with the synonyms of the verb मन्यति. So also the <i>sutra</i> uses the form मन्य with the <i>vikarana</i> श्यण्, indicating that it is <i>Divadi</i> that governs a dative, and not the <i>Tanadi</i> मन्; for the latter governs the accusative only, as न त्वां तृणं मन्ये.\n\nWhen contempt is not meant, the verb does not govern the Dative, as:-\n\nअश्मानं दृषदं मन्ये, मन्ये काष्ठमुलूखलम् । अन्धायास्तं सुतं मन्ये यस्य माता न पश्यति ॥\n\n'I consider a rock to be a stone, I consider mortar but as wood, I consider him to be the son of a blind woman whose mother cannot see.'\n\nSo also when the object of comparison is an animate being, it will not take the dative:- as न त्वां शृगालं मन्ये 'I do not consider thee even as a jackal.' The case of न त्वां शुने मन्ये is an exception.\n\nVart:- Instead of using अप्राणिषु in the <i>sutra</i>, the words अनावादिषु should be used. The following words belong to <i>Navadi</i> class, they are always in the accusative after the word मन्ये, never in the Dative :-- नो 'ship,' काक 'crow,' अन्न 'food,' शुक 'parrot,' and शृगाल 'jackal.'",
    "23018": "Ex. देवदत्तेन कृतं 'done by <i>Devadatta</i>,' दात्रेण लुनाति 'he cuts with the sickle.' So also यज्ञदत्तेन भुक्तम्, परशुना छिनत्ति ॥\n\nVart:- The following words take the 3rd case. प्रकृति 'original,' प्राय 'almost,' गोत्र '<i>gotra</i>,' सम 'equal,' विषम 'unequal,' द्विद्रोण, पंचक and साहस्र as प्रायेण याज्ञिकः, गार्ग्योऽस्मि गोत्रेण, समेन or विषमेण धावति, द्विद्रोणेन क्रीणाति &c.",
    "23019": "Ex. पुत्रेण सहागतः पिता 'the father has come with the son.'\n\nThe same will be the result with the synonyms of सह as, पुत्रेण सार्द्धं 'with the son'. So also when the word सह is understood, as <i>Panini</i> himself uses in [[1.2.65]] वृद्धो युना &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not the principal.' Observe, शिष्येण सहोपाध्यायस्य गौः.",
    "23020": "As, अक्ष्णा काणः 'blind of one eye' पादेन खंजः 'lame of foot.' पाणिना कुण्ठः &c. The word <i>anga</i> in this <i>sutra</i> applies to the whole body, whatsoever by reason of being a member of the body is defective is indicated here.",
    "23021": "जटाभिस्तापसः 'he is an ascetic by (the fact of his having) matted hair.' अपि भवान् कमण्डलुना छात्रमद्राक्षीत् 'your honor might see the student by the fact of his having a <i>kamandalu</i>.' So also छात्रेणोपाध्यायम् 'a teacher by the fact of having students.' शिखया परिव्राजकम् 'a <i>Parivrajaka</i> by a tuft of hair.' But not so here, कमण्डलुपाणिछात्रः ' a student has <i>kamandalu</i> in his hand.' Because here in the compound, कमण्डलुपाणि is hidden the mark.\n\nWhy do we say <i>ittha</i>-<i>bhuta</i>? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतनं.",
    "23022": "पित्रा or पितरं संजानीते 'he knows his father.' मात्रा or मातरं संजानीते ॥",
    "23023": "विद्यया यशः 'by learning there is produced fame.' धनेन कुलम् 'by wealth, family;' कन्यया शोकः 'by daughter there is grief.'\n\nThe word हेतु here is used in its popular sense and not the grammatical <i>hetu</i> [[1.4.55]]. Any  thing capable of accomplishing a desired object is called <i>hetu</i>.",
    "23024": "Ex. शताद्बद्धः 'he has been bound on account of a debt of a hundred pieces.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when not denoting the agent ?' Observe शतेन बन्धितः; 'a debt of hundred has thrown him in prison'; here शत being considered as a <i>prayojaka</i> <i>hetu</i>, is an agent and takes the third case-affix.",
    "23025": "Ex. जाड्येन जाड्यताम् वा बद्धः 'he has been bound by reason of his dullness.' पांडित्येन or पांडित्याद् मुक्तः 'saved through learning.'\n\n<i>Guna</i>-<i>vachana</i> nouns are generally abstract nouns. Therefore not here धनेन कुलम्. If an abstract noun is of feminine gender, this rule will not apply, as वुद्ध्या or प्रज्ञया मुक्तः 'he was set at liberty on account of his skill or wisdom.'",
    "23026": "Ex. अन्नस्य हेतोर्वसति 'he dwells for the sake of food.'",
    "23027": "Ex. कस्य or केन हेतुना वसति 'for the sake of what does he live?' यस्य or येन हेतुना वसति ।\n\nVart:- When the words निमित्त or कारण are so used, almost all the case affixes may be employed; as किं निमित्तं or केन निमित्तेन or कस्मै निमित्ताय or कस्मान्निमित्तात् or कस्मिन् निमित्ते वसति. Similarly with the words <i>karana</i> and <i>hetu</i>. Here also the word हेतु does not mean the word-form <i>hetu</i> [[1.1.68]] bub its synonyms also; as किं प्रयोजनं or केन प्रयोजनेन or कस्मै प्रयोजनाय &c., वसति.",
    "23028": "Ex. ग्रामादागच्छति 'he comes from the village' [[1.4.24]]; वृकेभ्यो बिभेति [[1.4.25]], अध्ययनात् पराजयते [[1.4.26]] &c.\n\nVart:- The fifth case-affix is employed in denoting the object, when the verbal participle ending in ल्यप् is elided; as प्रासादमारुह्य प्रेक्षते = प्रासादात् प्रेक्षते 'he sees from a palace.'\n\nVart:- And under similar circumstances in denoting the location the place where an action is performed is put in the ablative case, as, आसने उपविश्य प्रेक्षते = आसनात् प्रेक्षते 'he sees from a seat.'\n\nVart:- In questions and answers, the fifth case-affix is employed:- कुतो भवान् ? पाटलिपुत्राद् 'whence is your Honor coming? From <i>Pataliputra</i>'\n\nVart:- That point of time or space from which distance in time or space is measured is put in the ablative case:-as, गवीधूमतः सांकाश्यं चत्वारि योजनानि '<i>Sankasya</i> is from <i>Gavidhuma</i> four <i>yojanas</i>.' कार्त्तिक्या आग्रहायणी मासे '<i>Agrahayana</i> is one month from <i>Kartika</i>. The word denoting the distance in time is put in the locative case, as मासे\n\nVart:- In the above the word denoting the distance in space may be put either in the nominative or locative; as गवीधूमतः सांकाश्यं चत्वारि योजनानि or चतुर्षु योजनेषु ।",
    "23029": "Ex. अन्यो, भिन्नो, इतरो, अर्थान्तरं, विलक्षणो  वा देवदत्तात् 'different from <i>Devadatta</i>' आराद् देवदत्तात् 'remote from or near to <i>Devadatta</i>.' The word <i>arat</i> meaning 'near or remote' would have taken the sixth case-affix by <i>sutra</i> 34, but this enjoins 5th case-affix. ऋते देवदत्तात्  'excepting <i>Devadatta</i>.' पूर्वो ग्रामात् 'east of the village,' उत्तरो ग्रामात् 'north of the village,' पूर्वो ग्रीष्मात् वसन्तः 'the spring is prior to summer' प्राक् प्रत्यग्वा ग्रामात् 'to the east or west of the village' दक्षिणा दक्षिणाहि वा ग्रामात् 'to the south or in the eastern direction of the village.'\n\nThe words like प्राक् &c., formed from the verb <i>anchu</i> are also दिक्शब्दः; their separate enumeration shows that the sixth case-affix ordained by the next <i>sutra</i> does not come after them.",
    "23030": "The affix अतसुच् is ordained by [[5.3.28]].\n\nEx. ग्रामस्य दक्षिणतः उत्तरतः पुरस्तात् उपरि वा 'to the south or north, foremost, in or above the village.'",
    "23031": "Ex. दक्षिणेन ग्रामम् ग्रामस्य वा 'south of the village.'",
    "23032": "Ex. रामाद्रामेण रामं वा विना पृथग् नाना वा 'without or different from <i>Rama</i>.'\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> may be divided into two parts:- (1) पृथग् विना नानाभिः (2) तृतीयाऽन्यतरस्याम्. By this arrangement we can read <i>dvitiya</i> into the aphorism.\n\nविना वातं विना वर्षं विद्युत्प्रपतनं विना ।\nविना हस्ति कृतान्दोषान् केनेमौ पातितौ द्रुमौ ॥",
    "23033": "Ex. स्तोकात् स्तोकेन वा मुक्तः and अल्पान्मुक्तः or अल्पेनमुक्तः &c, 'he got off easily &c. But स्तोकेन विषेन हतः, अल्पेन मधुना मत्तः &c. 'killed by a little poison.' No option allowed, as it qualifies a substance. So also स्तोकं मुञ्चति 'he loosens a little.' Here स्तोक is used as an adverb and not as an instrument (करण).",
    "23034": "Ex. ग्रामाद् ग्रामस्य वा वनं दूरं विप्रकृष्टं, अन्तिकं, अभ्याशं, निकटं समीपं वा 'the forest is distant or near or to the village.'\n\nThe force of the word अन्यतरस्यां is to indicate that the 5th case-affix employed in the alternative, would have run into this <i>sutra</i>, had we not used '<i>anyatarasyam</i>.'",
    "23035": "Ex. दूरं दूराद् दूरेण वा ग्रामस्य and अन्तिकात्, or अन्तिकेन अन्तिकं ग्रामस्य.\n\nThis rule applies only when these words have their original signification and do not denote a substance. Otherwise the proper case-affix should be employed, as दूरः पन्थाः, दूराय पथे देहि.",
    "23036": "Ex. कटे आस्ते 'he sits on the mat' अन्तिके दूरे वा ग्रामस्य 'near or distant from the village.' स्थाल्यां पचति 'he cooks in the pot.' Thus the words दूर and अन्तिक take four case-affixes, namely the second, third, fifth and seventh.\nVart:- Words like अधीतिन् 'who has learnt,' गृहीतिन् 'who has comprehended;' i. e., words formed by adding इन् to the past participle in क्त, govern the locative of that which forms their object:- as अधीती व्याकरणे 'versed in grammar.' परिगणिती यज्ञिके 'well versed in sacrificial rites.' आम्नान्ती छन्दसि 'well read in the <i>Veda</i>.' See [[5.2.88]].\n\nVart:- The words साधु and असाधु govern the locative of that towards whom goodness or otherwise is shown; as मातरि साधुरसाधु वा 'well behaved or ill-behaved towards his mother.'\n\nVart:- The Locative absolute is used in cases other than those specified in the next <i>sutra</i>, namely, in cases where the action done or suffered does not indicate the time of another action; as ऋद्धेषु भुञ्जानेषु दरिद्रा आसते 'the poor are sitting, while the rich are eating,' दरिद्रेषु आसीनेषु ऋद्धाभुञ्जते 'the rich are eating, while the poor being seated.' So also vice versa.\n\nVart:- The Locative is sometimes used to denote the object or purpose for which anything is done; as.\n\nचर्मणि द्वीपिनं हंति, दंतयोर्हन्तिकुंजरम् ।\nकेशेषु चमरीं हंति सोम्नि पुष्कलको हतः ॥\n\n'Man kills the tiger for his skin, the elephant for his tusks, for <i>chamari</i> cow for her hair, and the musk-deer for its musk.'",
    "23037": "This is Locative Absolute. गोषु दुह्यमानासु गतः 'the cows being milked, he went away' दुग्धास्वागतः 'and returned when they were milked'. अग्निषु हूयमानेषु गतः, हुतेष्वागतः.\n\nWhy do we say 'by the action of whatsoever'? Observe यो जटाभिः स भुक्ते. Why have we used the word 'action' twice? Witness यो भुक्ते स देवदत्तः.",
    "23038": "This is Genitive Absolute. रुदतः रुदति वा प्राव्राजीत् 'in spite of her weeping, he went away.' The force of this genitive is that of the English word 'not withstanding' 'in spite of' 'for all,' &c., नन्दाः पशव इव हताः पश्यतो राक्षसस्य 'the <i>Nandas</i> were killed like so many beasts <i>Rakshasa</i> looking on,' (not-with-standing that <i>Rakshasa</i> was looking on).",
    "23039": "गवां गोषु वा स्वामी or ईश्वर 'master of cows.' So also गवामधिपतिः or गोष्वधिपतिः, गवां दायादः or गोषु दायादः, गवां or गोषु साक्षी प्रतिभूः &c.\n\nThese words naturally would have governed the Genitive; the present <i>sutra</i> ordains Locative as well.",
    "23040": "Ex. आयुक्तः कुशलो वा कटकरणे कटकरणस्य वा 'deeply absorbed in mat-making.'\n\nWhen not meaning 'deeply absorbed,' the construction is different; as आयुक्तो गौ शकटे 'the cow is slightly yoked to the cart.' Here the seventh case-affix only is employed.",
    "23041": "Ex. गवां गोषु वा कृष्णा बहुक्षीराः 'among cows the black one gives much milk,' मनुष्याणां or मनुष्येषु क्षत्रियः शूरतमः.\n\nA <i>nirdharana</i> or specification is made by separating one from the many by reason of its genus, quality and action [[2.2.10]].",
    "23042": "This debars the sixth and the seventh case-affixes, as, माथुराः पाटलिपुत्रेभ्यः सुकुमारतराः '<i>Mathura</i> is more beautiful than <i>Pataliputra</i>.'",
    "23043": "मातरि साधुः or निपुणः 'good behaved towards his mother'? But साधुर्देवदत्तो मातरं प्रति '<i>Devadatta</i> is good behaved towards his mother.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when respect is denoted'? Observe, साधुर्भृत्योराज्ञः 'the servant is good towards the king.' Here it is a bare statement of a fact.\n\nThe exception applies not only to प्रति but to other prepositions, like परि, अनु &c., as, मातरं परि साधुर्देवदत्तः ॥",
    "23044": "Ex. निद्रायां निद्रया वा उत्सुकः 'longing for sleep,' केशैः or केशेषु प्रसितः",
    "23045": "Ex. पुष्येण पुष्ये वा पायसमश्नीयात् 'when the moon is in the Asterism of <i>Pushya</i>, let him drink milk.' See Rules [[4.2.4]] and [[4.2.5]]. So also मघाभिः पललौदनं मघासु पललौदनम्. But not so here पंचालेषु वसति 'he lives in <i>Panchala</i>'. Here the country is meant, and not a star, though here also there is elision of the <i>Taddhita</i> affix.\n\nWhy do we say '<i>lup</i> elision'? Observe मघासु ग्रहः 'the planet in the <i>Magha</i>.' Here there is no elision. But why not in अद्यपुष्यः, अद्यकृत्तिका. Because they do not denote location, which is understood. It is when location is expressed by such words that we may use the third case-affix in the alternative.",
    "23046": "Ex. उच्चैः 'aloft,' नीचैः 'below,' कुमारी 'virgin,' वृक्षः 'tree,' कूंडं 'owl,' द्रोणः 'a measure'. By 'number' grammatical number is meant; as एकः 'one,' द्वौ 'two,' बहवः 'many'.\n\nThe sense of a <i>Pratipadika</i> is to denote mere existence. Genders are three, masculine, feminine and neuter. Measures are such as <i>drona</i>, <i>khari</i>, <i>adhaka</i> &c. Numbers are singular, dual and plural. The <i>Nipatas</i> which do not denote anything are also <i>Pratipadika</i>.",
    "23047": "Ex. हे राम '<i>O</i> <i>Ram</i>' हे रामौ, हे रामाः ॥",
    "23048": "",
    "23049": "The vocative singular is called <i>sambuddhi</i>, when it is employed in the vocation. Thus [[6.1.69]] declares 'after an inflectien base ending in एङ् or in a short vowel, a consonant is elided if it be that of '<i>Sambuddhi</i>' as हे राम ॥",
    "23050": "Ex. राज्ञः पुरुषः 'the king's man' पशोः पादः 'beast's foot' पितुः पुत्रः 'father's son.'",
    "23051": "Ex. मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice with honey'. So also सर्पिषो जानीते. The verb ज्ञा when not meaning 'to know', has the significance of 'to act, or to engage in;' or it may denote 'false knowledge'; as सर्पिषि रक्तः प्रतिहतोवा. Compare [[1.3.45]].\n\nBut not so here स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he recognises the son by the voice.'",
    "23052": "Ex. मातुः अध्येति 'he remembers the mother,' सर्पिषो दयते 'he gives clarified butter,' नायं गात्राणामीष्टे 'he can not rule his limbs.' But not so here मातुर्गुणैः स्मरति because गुण here is not the object. The word शेष is also understood here. So that the cases not otherwise provided for, take this case. So that मातरं स्मरति is also allowed.",
    "23053": "Ex. एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the wood gives a new quality to the water' (or he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice). (By [[6.1.139]], स is inserted).\n\nWhen प्रतियत्न is not meant, the second case-affix is employed: as कटं करोति.\n\nThe word शेष is also understood here. So that we have also एधोदकमुपस्कुरुते ॥",
    "23054": "Ex. चौरस्य रुजति रोगः 'the disease afflicts the thief' चौरस्यामयति आमयः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the subject is an Abstract noun'? Observe नदी कूलानि रुजति 'the river breaks the banks.' So also not here चौरं ज्वरयति ज्वरः 'the fever burns the thief.' So also when the verb संताप is used, चौरं संतापयति तापः ।\n३\nThe word शेष is also understood here. Thus चौरं रुजति रोगः ॥",
    "23055": "Ex. मधुनो नाथते 'he blesses the honey.' But माणवकमुपनाथति, अंग पुत्रीकाधीष्व 'he solicits <i>manavaka</i> saying (child) son, study.' Here नाथ does not mean to bless, and so it takes the accusative case.",
    "23056": "चौरस्य उज्जासयति, निप्रहन्ति, निहन्ति, प्रहन्ति, प्रणिहन्ति, उन्नाटयति, क्राथयति, पिनष्टि वा, 'he injures the thief.'\n\nThe root जसु belonging to the <i>Churadi</i> class should be taken, and not <i>Divadi</i>. हन with the prepositions <i>pra</i> and <i>ni</i> may be taken in any order. The root क्रथ् takes in the causative <i>vriddhi</i> irregularly. The verb is <i>Bhvadi</i> and falls into the subdivision <i>ghatadi</i>, and is called there a मित् verb; all मित् verbs shorten their penultimate before the causative affix णिच् [[6.4.92]]. Thus क्राथ is an irregularity.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to injure'? Observe धानाः पिनष्टि 'he pounds the barley.'\n\nThe word शेष is also understood here as चौरमुज्जासयति. Only these govern the genitive, not so here चौरं हिनस्ति. चौरं विहन्ति ॥",
    "23057": "Ex. शतस्य व्यवहरति or पणते 'he deals in, or stakes hundred.'\n\nWhy does not the verb पण take the affix आय् ? It takes आय् when meaning 'to praise or honor,' and not in the sense of 'gambling, or bartering' &c. Not so here शलाकां व्यवहरति 'he throws the dice,' ब्राह्मणान् पणायते 'he praises the <i>Brahmanas</i>.' The word शेष is also here understood, so that we have शतं पणते 'he stakes a hundred.'",
    "23058": "Ex. शतस्य दीव्यति 'he stakes or deals in a hundred.' But not in ब्राह्मणं दीव्यति 'he jokes with the <i>Brahmana</i>.'\n\nThe <i>yoga</i> <i>vibhaga</i> when this root might well have been included in the last aphorism, is for the sake of the succeeding <i>sutras</i>, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of दिव runs, and not of others.",
    "23059": "Ex. शतस्य शतं वा प्रति दीव्यति 'he deals in or stakes a hundred.' But no option is allowed when the verb is simple as in the last aphorism; nor does this rule apply when the sense is not that of dealing or gambling. As, शलाकां प्रति दीव्यति 'he throws the missile.'",
    "23060": "Ex. गामस्य तदहः सभायां दीव्येयुः (<i>Maitr</i>.S.1.6.11) In the Vedic literature the simple verb <i>div</i> takes the accusative instead of the genitive. And with <i>upasargas</i> it is optional. The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word शेष does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>, or the following.",
    "23061": "Ex. अग्नये छागस्य हविषोवपाया मेदसोऽनुब्रूहि प्रेष्य वा 'send to fire as oblation, the goat, the fat, and the marrow.' But not here —अग्नये छागं हविर्वपां मेदो जुहुधि. Because the verb is not <i>preshya</i> or <i>bruhi</i> So also not here अग्नये गोमयान् प्रेष्य. Because it is not an oblation. Not here too माणवकाय पुरोडाशं प्रेष्य. Because the recepient is not a diety. Compare [[8.2.91]].\n\nVart:- This rule does not apply when the word 'set out' qualifies the word हविः as; इन्द्राग्निभ्यां छागं हविर्वपां मेदः प्रस्थितं प्रेष्य 'send to <i>Indra</i> and <i>Agni</i> the oblation set out for them' &c.",
    "23062": "Ex. पुरुषमृगश्चन्द्रमसः or चन्द्रमसे 'to the moon, a male deer.' गोधा कालका दार्वा घाटस्ते वनस्पतीनाम् or वनस्पतिभ्यः, to you lords of the forest, are lizard, <i>kalaka</i> bird, &c. So also वायुरस्मा उपा मन्थत् (<i>R</i>. <i>Ved</i> X. 136. 7).\n\nWhy do we say 'diversely?' Observe कृष्णोरात्र्यै, हिमवती हस्ती.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Veda</i>, the 4th case-affix is employed in the sense of the sixth : as या खर्वेण पिबति तस्यै खर्वोजायते 'who soever woman drinks with a woman in her courses, gets herself in menstrua. So also या दतो धावति तस्यै श्यावदन् 'who cleans her teeth, her teeth become black.' या नखानि कृन्तति तस्यै कुनखः 'who pairs her nails, her nails become ugly.' So on, in याऽङ्क्तेतस्यै काणः याऽभ्यङ्क्तेतस्यै दुश्चर्मा, या केशान् प्रलिखति तस्यै खलति ॥ अहल्यायै जारः (T.S. 2.5.1.7.)",
    "23063": "Ex. घृतस्य or घृतेन यजते 'he sacrifices with butter.' सोमस्य or सोमेन यजते ॥",
    "23064": "Ex. पंचकृत्वोऽऽह्नोभुंक्ते 'he eats five times a day.' In short, 'words meaning so many times, or the numeral adverbs of frequency, govern the genitive of time in the sense of locative.' As द्विरह्नोऽधीते 'he studies twice in a day.'\n\nWhy do we say 'having the force of कृत्वसुच् ? Observe अह्नि शेते 'he sleeps in the day.'\n\nThis rule will not apply when the adverb of frequency is understood, not expressed (<i>prayoga</i>) as in अहनि भुक्तम्. Nor when the time is not meant, as द्विः कांस्यापात्र्यां भुंक्ते 'he eats in two brass vessels.' So also when location is not meant : as द्विरह्नो भुंक्ते. The शेष being understood we have द्विरहन्यधीते.",
    "23065": "Ex. क्रियां कालिदासस्य 'the composition of <i>Kalidasa</i>.' आहता क्रतूनां 'the performer of sacrifice.' So also भवतः शायिका 'your turn of lying down.' अपां स्रष्टा, पुरां भेत्ता वज्रस्य भर्त्ता. But not in शस्त्रेण भेत्ता 'cutting with weapon.'\n\nWhy do we say '<i>krit</i>?' Not so when a <i>Taddhita</i>-affix is employed as कृतपूर्वीकटं. In other words, the genitive in Sanskrit is both subjective and objective.",
    "23066": "आश्चर्य्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of a cow without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते मे ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन. 'The eating of rice by <i>Devadatta</i> pleases me;' पयसः पानं यज्ञदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by <i>Yajnadatta</i>.'\n\nVart:- When the agent and object are both used, the agent is put in the instrumental, or genitive case, when, as some say, the <i>krit</i> terminations are of the feminine gender, or as others say, when the terminations are of any gender; as, विचित्रा जगतः कृतिर्हरेर्हरिणा वा 'the creation of the world by <i>Hari</i> is wonderful' शब्दानामनुशासनमाचार्य्येण आचार्यस्यवा 'the dissertation on words by the <i>acharya</i>' पवित्राहि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः  or पाणिनिना वा 'beautiful is the structure of <i>sutra</i> by <i>Panini</i>.' <i>Apte</i>.",
    "23067": "Ex. राज्ञां पूजितः 'honored by kings,' अहमेवमतो महीपतेः 'I alone am regarded by the king.'\n\nWhy do we say 'क्त'? Observe ओदनं पचमानः 'rice is cooked.' Why do we say 'when denoting the present tense'?  Observe ग्रामं गतः 'gone to the village.'\n\nVart:- When used as abstract neuter nouns, past participles are used with the genitive, as मयूरस्य नृत्तं 'the dancing of a peacock' छात्रस्य हसितं 'the laughing of the student'. कोकिलस्य व्याहूतम् 'the screaming of the cuckoo.' When, however, agent is desired to be particularised, the instrumental case is employed : as छात्रेण हसितम्.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> debars <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.69]] by which genitive is prohibited after <i>Nishtha</i> affixes. This is an exception to that <i>sutra</i>.",
    "23068": "This also is an exception to the prohibition about <i>Nishtha</i> contained in [[2.3.69]]. As इदमेषामासितम् 'this is their seat.' इदमेषां शयितं 'this is their sleeping.'\n\nIn connection with verbs taking two objects, both take the genitive case, when a word ending in <i>krit</i>-affix denotes the agent, as they would have taken the accusative : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामस्य चैत्रः '<i>Chaitra</i> is the leader of the horse of the village.' When, however, one is the principal, then the object takes the genitive : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामं चैत्रः, '<i>Chaitra</i> leads the horse to the village.'",
    "23069": "After these words, the Instrumental case must be employed to denote the Agent, and the Accusative case to denote the object. This <i>sutra</i> debars Genitive which would have come by [[2.3.65]]. The word लोक is formed by ल + उ + उक = ल + ऊक = लोक.\n\n1. The word ल means the substitutes of ल i.e., the Present Participles in शतृ, शानच् [[3.2.124]], कानच् [[3.2.106]] क्वसु [[3.2.107]] कि and किन् [[3.2.172]]. Thus ओदनं पचन्, पचमानः, पेचानः or पेचिवान्, पपिः सोमम्, ददिर्गाः ॥\n\n2. The affix उ is enjoined by [[3.2.168]], as, कटं चिकीर्षुः, ओदनं बुभुक्षुः ॥ The prohibition applies when a word ending in इष्णुच् [[3.2.136]] is the governing term, as, कन्यामलंकरिष्णुः ॥\n\n3. The affix उक is ordained by [[3.2.154]]: as आगामुकं वाराणसीं रक्ष आहुः ॥\n\nVart:- But the word कामुक in the classical Sanskrit, governs the Genitive, as दास्याः कामुकः 'lusting for the slave.'\n\n4. Indeclinables formed by कृत् affixes, as, कटं कृत्वा, ओदनं भुक्त्वा ॥  \n\nVart:- This prohibition, however, does not apply to the indeclinables formed by तोसुन् (III 4.16) and कसुन् [[3.4.17]], as, पुरा सूर्यस्योदेतोराधेयः पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपो विरप्शिन् (1. 1. 40).\n\n5. <i>Nishtha</i> i.e., क्त and क्तवतु; as ओदनं भुक्तवान् देवदत्तेन कृतम्.\n\n6. The words formed by खलर्थ affixes [[3.3.126]], as, ईषत्करो भवता कटः, ईषत्पानः सोमो भवता.\n\n7. The तृन् in the aphorism is a <i>pratyahara</i>, formed by taking the तृ of  शतृ [[3.2.129]] and the final न् of तृन् [[3.2.135]], meaning the affixes जानन् [[3.2.128]], चानश [[3.2.129]], शतृ [[3.2.130]] and तृन् [[3.2.135]]. As सोमं पवमानः, नटमाघ्नानः, अधीयन्, पारायणम्, कर्ता कटान्, वदिता जनापवादान् ।\n\nVart:- Optionally so, when the root द्विष् takes the affix शतृ, as, चौरं or चौरस्य द्विषन् ॥",
    "23070": "The affix अक, such as ण्वुल, वुञ् &c., denote futurity, and never denote indebtedness. The affix इन् such as णिनि [[3.3.3]] and [[3.3.170]] denotes both. Thus कटं कारको व्रजति 'he goes to make a mat.' ओदनं भोजको व्रजति 'he goes to eat rice.' So also with इन्, as ग्रामंगमी or ग्रामी 'he has to go to the village.' शतं दायी 'he owes hundred.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting futurity or indebtedness' ? Observe यवानां लावकः 'the cutter of barley.' सक्तूनां पावकः, अवश्यं करी कटस्य ॥\n\nWhy is the Genitive employed in the following वर्षशतस्य पूरकः, पुत्रपौत्राणां दर्शकः ? The words पूरक and दर्शक, though formed by अक [[3.1.133]], are not formed by that अक which denotes futurity, viz., (II . 3. 10). The present <i>sutra</i> relates to this latter अक, and not every अक in general.",
    "23071": "By [[2.3.65]], verbal nouns, (<i>krit</i>-formed), always govern the Genitive in denoting agent or object. The present <i>sutra</i> declares an option as to agent only, in the case of those verbal nouns which are Future Passive Participles.

As गेयो माणवकः साम्नाम् ॥\n\nVart:- The prohibition of the Genitive should be stated in the case of the Future Passive Participles of those verbs which govern two objects. Thus क्रष्टव्या ग्रामं शाखा देवदत्तेन, नेतव्या ग्राममजा देवदत्तेन ॥",

As तुला देवदत्तस्य नास्ति, उपमा कृष्णस्य न विद्यते ॥\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of वा was understood in this <i>sutra</i> from the previous <i>sutra</i>, yet the repetition of अन्यतरस्याम् is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>. The word च in [[2.3.73]] attracts the word अन्यतरस्याम् into that <i>sutra</i>; but had the word अन्यतरस्याम् not been used in this <i>sutra</i>, then the word च would have attracted the word तृतीया instead, which is not desired.\n\nOn this <i>sutra</i>, Professor <i>Apte</i> says:-- '<i>Panini</i> says that the words तुला and उपमा can not be used with the Instrumental. But this is against good usage : as तुलां, यदारोहति दंतवाससा (<i>Kum</i>. <i>Sam</i>. V. 24), नभसा तुलां समाररोह (<i>Raghuvamsa</i> VIII. 15). स्फुठोपमं भूतिसितेन शंभुना (<i>Magh</i> I. 4).'",

    "24001": "The word एकवचन is a genitive <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i> compound meaning 'the expression for one,' that is to say, it expresses the sense of unity. The rule therefore, enjoins that the sense inherent in a <i>Dvigu</i> compound is that of unity.\n\nThis is confined to <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i> i.e., an aggregate compound taken in a collective sense. As, पञ्चगवं 'an aggregate of five cows', पञ्चपली (IV.1. 21.). The sense of <i>Dvigu</i> being that of one, it follows that it retains the singular number even when further modified by other affixes, and used as an attributive and though no longer a <i>Dvigu</i>, as, पञ्चपूलीयं शोभना ॥",

The present rule also gives us an index as to where we must make <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvandva</i> and where an <i>Itaretara</i> <i>Dvandva</i>. The <i>Dvandva</i> compounds of words signifying members of animal body, players or army, are always and solely <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvandva</i>. The compounds of words like दधिपयसी 'curd and milk' (II. 4. 14.) are purely <i>Itaretara</i> <i>Dvandva</i> and can never be <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvandva</i>; while compounds of words denoting tree, animals &c., (II. 4. 12.) are optionally either <i>Samahara</i> or <i>Itaretara</i> <i>Dvandva</i>.",
    "24003": "The word चरण means a school or branch of any of the Vedas designated by the name of the person who founded such a branch and hence means such a person. The word अनुवाद means repetition by way of explanation, illustration or corroboration; that is to say, when a speaker demonstrates for some special purposes, a proposition which had already been demonstrated before, that is called <i>anuvada</i>.\n\nThis aggregate is used with the aorist of the roots स्था and इङ् only; as उदगात् कठकालापम् '<i>katha</i> and <i>kalapa</i> arose (again, further demonstrating their doctrines)'; प्रत्यष्ठात् कठकौथुमम् '<i>katha</i> and <i>kauthuma</i> established again.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning repetition'?

Qualities are twenty-four: colour, savour, odour tangibility, number, dimension, severalty, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, weight, fluidity, viscidity, sound, understanding, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit and faculty.

Observe गौपालिशालंकायनाः कलहायन्ते '<i>Gaupali</i> and <i>Salankayana</i> are quarrelling.'\n\nThe force of the word च in the aphorism is that of एव 'only.' <i>Dvandva</i> compounds of such animals only are invariably singular; no other rule, even if otherwise applicable, would apply to such compounds.

    "24032": "The word अन्वादेश means literally saying (<i>adesa</i>) 'after' (<i>anu</i>) or after-say or re-employment.\n\nअश् (actually अ) replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative, when <i>anvadesa</i> or repetition is implied. अश् replaces the whole of इदम् by 55 and not only the final म्. <i>Anvadesa</i> means repeating in a second sentence with reference to the preceding in which it has already been used. Both pronouns, the antecedent and the subsequent, must refer to the same object. As, आभ्याम् छात्राभ्याम् रात्रिरधीता, अथो आभ्यामहरप्यधीम् 'Those students studied in the night and they have read in the day also.' The substitute अश् will replace इदम्, even when the latter takes the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71.)\n\nअस्मै छात्राय कम्बलं देहि, अथो अस्मै शाकटमपि देहि 'Give this student a blanket and give him also a cloth'. अस्य छात्रस्य शोभनं शीलम्, अथो अस्य प्रभूतं स्वम्, 'this student's conduct is excellent, and his wealth is great.'\n\nSo also when the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]] comes after the Pronominal as इमकाभ्यां छात्राभ्यां रात्रिरधीता, अथो आभ्यामहरप्यधीतम्.\n\nThe mere mentioning in a subsequent sentences is now <i>anvadesa</i> : it is the employment again of what has been employed to direct one operation, to direct another operation. Therefore the rule does not apply here :- देवदत्तं भोजय, इमंच यज्ञदत्तम्  'feed <i>Devadatta</i> and this <i>Yajnadatta</i>.'",
    "24033": "Thus अत्र 'here,' and अतस् 'hence' in the following :- एतस्मिन् ग्रामे सुखं वसामः ; अथो अत्र युक्ता अधीमहे । 'We live in this (<i>etasmin</i>) village, happily, therefore let us read with full devotion in this (<i>atra</i>).' एतस्माच्छात्राच्छन्दोऽधीष्व, अथो अतो व्याकरणमप्यधीष्व । 'Learn from this student Prosody and also learn from him Grammar.' By rule (V. 3. 5.) अश् is declared to be the substitute of एतद्; its repetition here is to indicate that this अश् of <i>anvadesa</i> is <i>anudatta</i>.",
    "24034": "The word इदम् is also understood in this <i>sutra</i> though it was not so in the last. This skipping is technically called 'frog-leap.' Thus:- इमं or एतं छात्रं छन्दोऽध्यापय, अथो एमं व्याकरणमप्यध्यापय 'teach this pupil Prosody, and teach him Grammar also,' अनेन or एतेन छात्रेण रात्रिरधीता 'अथो एनेनाहरप्यधीतम् 'this pupil studied in the night and he studied in the day also'. अनयोः or एतयोः छात्रयोः शोभनं शीलम्, अथो एनयोः प्रभूतं स्वं 'the family of these two students is respectable and their wealth is great.'\n\nVart:- The word एनत् neuter and singular, is also used in <i>anvadesa</i>: as, इदम् कुण्डमानय प्रक्षालयैनत् 'bring this bowl and wash it.' The above three <i>Sutra</i> regulate the accent only of certain pronouns.",
    "24035": "Thus it will be taught in <i>sutra</i> (2. 4. 42),' that वध् is the substitute of हन् when लिङ् follows.' The words 'when the affix is <i>ardhadhatuka</i>' must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. The result will be that in the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> लिङ् namely the आशीर्लिङ् or the Benedictive mood, हन् is replaced by वध्, but not so in the <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> लिङ् i. e., the Potential mood (विधिलिङ्). Thus, Benedictive वध्यात् 'may he kill'; but Potential हन्यात् 'let him kill.'\n\nThe word आर्द्धधातुके is in the 7th case; the force of this case-affix here is not that given in (l. 1. 66). i. e., the <i>sutra</i> does not mean 'when an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows.' But the 7th case has the force of indicating the subject, the meaning of the <i>sutra</i> being 'when the subject is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix.' The result of this explanation is, that the various substitutions enjoined hereafter should be made first, and then the respective affixes should be applied. Thus whenever we want to affix any <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affix to अस् 'to be,' we must first substitute भू for it, and then take the proper <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affix which would come with regard to भू. Thus we can apply यत to भू by rule [[3.1.97]] which says: 'after verbs ending in vowels यत is applied.' But this affix could never have been applied to अस् which ends in a consonant. Thus we have भव्यम्. So the substitution does not depend upon any particular affix, but <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affixes as a class.",
    "24036": "प्रजग्ध्य 'Having eaten.' (प्र + अद् + ल्यप् = प्र + जग्ध् + य). So also जग्ध 'eaten' (अद्  + क्त =जग्ध् + त).\n\nThe इ in जग्धि is merely for the sake of articulation and is not an <i>anubandha</i>, otherwise there would have been the insertion of the nasal न (नुम्). So also the इ in वचि &c, is merely for the sake of articulation. But अद् + क्त = अन्नः 'food' is an irregularity.\n\nThe employment of ल्यप् in this <i>sutra</i> indicates the existence of this <i>Paribhasha</i>. 'A <i>bahiranga</i> substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even <i>antaranga</i> rules.' Because in case this maxim did not exist, the substitution of जग्ध् for अद् before ल्यप् which is taught in this <i>sutra</i>, would follow already from the word किति (before that which is distinguished by an indicatory क) in this rule, i. e., जग्ध् would (by maxim 'that which is <i>bahiranga</i> is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is <i>antaranga</i> has taken effect') first be substituted for अद् before क्त and ल्यप् afterwards for क्त.\n\nWhy do we say 'before affixes beginning with त'? Observe अद्यते 'is eaten.'\n\nWhy do we say 'before affixes having indicatory क'? Observe अत्तव्यम्.",
    "24037": "अघसत्, अघसताम्, अघसन् 'he ate.' The लृ in घस्लृ is servile and indicates the substitution of अङ् for च्वि of the Aorist (III. 1. 55.) So also in desiderative, as, जिघत्सति, जिघत्सतः जिघत्सन्ति 'wishes to eat.'\n\nVart:- The verb अद् is replaced by घस् when the affix अच् follows Thus प्र + अद् + अच् = घस् + अच् = प्रघसः 'voracious.'",
    "24038": "घासः 'food, grass,' अद् + घञ् = घास + अ [[3.3.19]]. प्रघसः 'voracity.' प्र + अद् + अप् = प्र + घस.",
    "24039": "घस्तान्नूनम् । सग्धिश्चने । (<i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i> <i>Vaj</i> <i>S</i>.XVIII. 9). Sometimes it does not take place; as आतामद्य मध्यतो भेद उद्भृतम्\n\nThe word बहुलं is used in this <i>sutra</i> and the word अन्यतरस्याम् in the next. There is evidently difference between the senses of these words; otherwise <i>Panini</i> would not have employed them in such juxtaposition, had they been synonymous. For then the anuvritti of बहुलं in the next <i>sutra</i> would have been sufficient. The following verse indicates that difference.\n\nक्वचित् प्रवृत्तिः क्वचिदप्रवृत्तिः, क्वचिदविभाषा क्वचिदन्यदेव ।\nविधेर्विधानं बहुधा समीक्ष्य, चातुर्विध बाहुलकं वदन्ति ॥\n\n'Sometimes they are, where there is no express rule for their application; sometimes they are not applied, in spite of an express rule for their application; sometimes they are optionally employed or not, and sometimes there is some other result, licence permitted by the rule.' Thus in घस्ताम् there is not elision of the penultimate.",
    "24040": "अघास or आद 'he ate,' जक्षतुः आदतुः 'they two ate,' जक्षुः or आदुः 'they all ate' The word जक्षतुः is thus formed :- घस् + अतुस् = घस् + अस् + अतुस् [[6.1.8]] = घ + घस् +अतुस् [[7.4.60]] = च + घस् + अतुः [[7.4.62]] = ज + घस् + अतुस् [[8.4.53]] = ज + घ्स् + अतुस् (VI. 4. 98.) = जक्षतुः [[8.3.60]].",
    "24041": "In the Perfect tense thus we have two roots: Let us first take वेञ्. Then we have regulary वे + लिट् = वे + णल् = ववौ. The roots in ए, ऐ and ओ are treated like roots ending in आ thus :-\n\n- 3rd person - ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः\n- 2nd person - वविथ or ववाथ, ववथुः, वव\n- 1st person - ववौ, वविव, वविम  \n\nIn this case <i>samprasarana</i> ordained by [[6.1.17]] does not take place by [[6.1.40]]\n\nWhen however we take the base वय्, th इ being for the sake of articulation only, we have the following forms:- वय् + णल् = वय् + वय् + अ [[6.1.8]] = उय् + वय् + अ [[6.1.17]] = उवाय; the य is not changed into इ by [[6.1.38]]. In this dual we have वय् + अतुस् = उय् + अतुः [[6.1.15]] = उ + उय् + अतुः [[7.4.60]] = ऊयतुः The affix अतुस् being कित् affix by rule [[1.2.5]] there is <i>samprasarana</i> before reduplication. Thus we have उयाय, ऊयतुः, ऊयुः. Further by rule [[6.1.39]] before कित् affixes व may be optionally substituted for य, i. e., ऊयतुः or ऊवतुः and ऊयुः or ऊवुः",
    "24042": "वध्यात् 'may he kill,' वध्यास्ताम् 'may they two kill,' वध्यासुः 'may they all kill.'\n\nThe substitute वध्, ends with short अ this अ is elided. This elision being like the original (<i>sthanivat</i> [[1.1.56]]), in forming the Aorist, लुङ्, we have अवध् + ० + ईत् = अवधीत्. Here zero being <i>sthanivat</i> prevents the <i>vriddhi</i> of अ of व which otherwise would have take place by [[7.2.7]].",
    "24043": "अवधीत् 'he killed,' अवधीष्टाम् 'they two killed.' The division of this aphorism from the last <i>sutra</i> (<i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>) indicates that the next rule applies to Aorist only and not to Benedictive as well. There is no option in Benedictive <i>Atmanepada</i>.",
    "24044": "Thus आवधिष्ट or आहत; आवधिषाताम् or आहसाताम्; आवधिशत or आहसत.\n\nThe verb हन् becomes <i>Atmanepadi</i> when preceded by आ [[1.3.28]] By <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.14]], the Aorist-affixes in the <i>Atmanepada</i> are कित् and हन् and by [[6.4.37]] the न is elided before कित् affixes then by [[8.2.27]] the स is elided. Thus आहन् + सिच् + त = आहत.",
    "24045": "अगात् 'he went' [[2.4.77]] अगाताम् 'they two went' जगुः 'they all went.' The repetition of the words लुङ् in this <i>sutra</i> though is <i>anuvritti</i> was coming from the last aphorisms, indicates that there is no option allowed even in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, गा being the invariable substitute in all the <i>Padas</i>. Thus अगायि भवता 'you, went.' The form अगात् is thus evolved आ + गा + सिच् + त् =, जगात् (II. 4. 77.)\n\nVart:- गा is the substitute of इक् 'to remember' in the Aorist as it is of इण्. Thus अध्यगात् 'he remembered.' अध्यागाताम्, अध्यगुः. The root इक् belongs to <i>Adadi</i> class.",
    "24046": "गमयति 'makes him go' गमयतः, गमयन्ति &c. But प्रत्याययति 'causes to believe.' अधिगामयति. The इ of गमि is for articulation. So also इक् to 'remember'; as, अधिगमयति ॥",
    "24047": "जिगमिषति 'wishes to go' जिगमिषतः, जिगमिषन्ति. But अर्थान् प्रतीषिषति 'he wishes to inform the meaning.' So also with इक्, as अधिजिगमिषति. The <i>yogavibhaga</i> indicates that the <i>anuvritti</i> of सन् only runs in the next <i>sutra</i> and not of णि. The form is thus evolved in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>; सन् + गम् = गम् + गम् + स [[6.1.9]] = ग + गम् + स [[7.4.60]] = ज + गम् + स [[7.4.62]] = ज + गम् + इट् + स [[7.2.50]] = जिगमिष, and then we add the personal terminations.",
    "24048": "अधिजिगांसते, ०सेते, ०सन्ते 'he wishes to study.' The root इङ् is always preceded by the preposition अधि. This will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> by (1. 3. 12) and (I. I. 56). The form is similarly evolved by the application of rules (VII. 2. 58.) and [[6.4.16]].",
    "24049": "The substitute being like its original (I. 1. 68.) गाङ् would have been <i>Atmanepadi</i>, even without the indicatory, ङ्. Why has then this ङ् been added to it? The object is that in the <i>sutra</i> (1. 2. 1.) गाङ् there should mean this substitute गाङ् and not the verb 'to go.'\n\nThus we get अधिजगे 'he studied'. अधिजगाते, अधिजगिरे. See [[6.4.64]] and [[3.4.8]].",
    "24050": "Let us take the case when गाङ् replaces इङ्. The affixes of लुङ् and लृङ् are treated as ङित् by [[1.2.1]]. and then by the Rule [[6.4.66]] (When an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix, beginning with a consonant and distinguished by an indicatory क or ङ् follows; then let ई be the substitute of long आ of the verbs termed घु and of मा, स्था, गा पा, हा, सी), we get अध्यगीष्ट (अधि + अ + गी + स्त), अध्यगीषाताम्, अध्यगीषत. In the alternative we have अध्यैष्ट, अध्यैषाताम् and अध्यैषत.\n\nSo also in लृङ्; as अध्यगीष्यत, अध्यगीष्येताम्, अध्यगीष्यन्त, or in the alternative, अध्यैष्यत,आध्यैष्येताम् and अध्यैष्यन्त.",
    "24051": "अधिजिगापयिषति or अध्यापिपयिषति 'he desires to teach.' The form is thus evolved : गा + णिच् = गापि [[7.3.36]]; then by the rules already stated, we get the above form with the affix सम्. अध्यजीगपत् or अध्यापिपत् 'he taught.' The ई is changed into आ by [[6.1.48]]. Thus इ + णिच् = आ + णिच् = आ + प् + इ = आपि. This rule applies to the desideratives of causatives and aorist of causatives.",
    "24052": "भविता 'he will be,' भवितुम् 'in order to be' भवितव्यम् 'must be.' Now the Perfect tense affixes are also <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes [[3.4.115]]. The Perfect of अस् is therefore the same as that of भू, namely, बभूव &c. There is, however, an important exception to this rule, namely, when अस् is employed as an auxiliary verb in forming Periphrastic Perfect of other verbs. In that case अस् forms its Perfect tense regularly, आस आसतुः आसुः &c. This apparent breach of the present <i>sutra</i> is explained by taking the term कृञ् in [[3.1.40]] as a <i>Pratyahara</i> including कृ, भू and अस्, and if अस् could not form its Perfect in the regular way, its inclusion in this <i>Pratyahara</i> would be useless; hence we conclude, that as an auxiliary verb, अस् forms its Perfect regularly.",
    "24053": "वक्ता 'he will speak,' वक्तुम् 'in order to speak.' The इ of वचि is for the sake of articulation only. The substitute being like the principal, वच् is <i>Atmanepadi</i> when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, as ऊचे 'he spoke,' वक्ष्यते 'he will speak.'",
    "24054": "आख्याता 'he will perceive or tell'; अख्यातुम् 'in order to tell;' अख्यातव्यम् 'must be told.' The substitute being like the principal, चक्षिङ् being always <i>Atmanepadi</i> [[1.3.12]], ख्याञ् would have also been always <i>Atmanepadi</i>. But in that case the letter ञ् would have no scope; it therefore follows that ख्याञ् is not always <i>Atmanepadi</i>, but under conditions mentioned in [[1.3.72]].\n\nVart:- This substitute is also said to begin with क्श instead of ख्य. Thus अक्शाता, आक्शातुम्, आक्शातव्यं.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when meaning 'exclusion'; as दुर्जनाः संचक्ष्याः 'bad men should be excluded.'\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when the affixes अस and अन follow : as नृचक्षा राक्षसः 'the <i>Rakshasas</i> are cruel.' This is Vedic Sanskrit; modern नृचक्षः. The meaning of the root चक्ष् here, is 'to injure.' So also निचक्षणः पण्डितः; here the affix is अन.\n\nVart:- Substitutes are made diversely in denoting appellatives and not qualities and in the Vedic Sanskrit; as अन्नम् 'food' (here the substitute जग्धि does not replace अद); वधकम् 'killer' (वध being substituted for हन् before ण्वुल्); गात्रं 'body' (गा is substituted for इण before the <i>unadi</i> affix ष्टन्); विचक्षणः (here चक्ष is not replaced by ख्या before अन); अजिरम् 'a court yard' (here अज is not replaced by व्यै as the next <i>sutra</i> 56 requires.)",
    "24055": "The लिट् also is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix and by the last <i>sutra</i> ख्या would always have been the substitute of चक्ष्; the present <i>sutra</i> makes this substitution optional, as आचख्यौ, आचख्यतुः and आचख्युः. In the alterative we have आचचक्षे, आचचक्षाते and आचचक्षिरे 'he told &c.'",
    "24056": "प्रवायकः 'driver,' प्रवायणीयः.\n\nWhy do we say 'with the exception of घञ् and अप्'? Observe सम् + अज + घञ् = समाजः 'society'; उदाजः 'driving out.' So also with अप्, as समजः 'a multitude or herd of animals &c., उदजः 'driving out of cattle.' See [[3.3.69]].\n\nWhy have we used वी with a long ई? For the sake of forms like प्रवीताः &c.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must also be stated (along with घञ् and अप्) of the affix क्यप्, as समज्या 'a meeting, fame.'\n\nVart:- The substitution is optional before <i>ardhadhatukas</i> beginning with a letter of वल् <i>Pratyahara</i> (all consonant except य) as प्रवेता or प्राजिता प्रवेतुम् or प्राजितुम्. See [[6.2.144]] for accent.",
    "24057": "This declares an option in case of the affix ल्युट्, the word यु in the <i>Sutra</i> referring to this affix; as, प्रवयणः or प्राजनो दण्डः 'driving stick or whip.'",
    "24058": "1. Thus by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.151]] (the affix ण्य comes after कुरु &c., in denoting descendent) we get कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः [[7.2.117]] 'a grandson of <i>Kuru</i>.' This is a <i>Gotra</i> word [[4.1.162]]. Now in forming a word denoting a lower descendent than grandson, we add a <i>Yuvan</i> affix. Thus कौरव्य + इञ् [[4.1.95]]. Now this इञ् is elided by the present <i>sutra</i>, and we get the form कौरव्यः which thus means both a <i>Gotra</i> and a <i>Yuvan</i> [[4.1.163]] descendent of <i>Kuru</i>. So that कौरव्यः is the name both of the father and the son.\n\nNow it may be objected : 'the word कौरव्यः belongs to the तिकादि class and by [[4.1.154]], it will take the affix फिञ्. Do we, what we may, the form will be कौरव्यायणिः (VII. 1. 2.') To this we reply, the word कौरव्यः which we see in that list of तिक् &c., is not the word कौरव्यः which we formed by adding ण्य under rule [[4.1.151]]; that <i>Tikadi</i> word is formed by adding ण्य under rule [[4.1.172]], and is confined to <i>Kshatriya</i>. The कौरव्यः which we have taken, denotes a <i>Brahmin</i> <i>Gotra</i> formed by [[4.1.151]].\n\n2. Now to give an example of a word denoting the descendent of a <i>Kshatriya</i>. We take (IV. 1. 114.) which tells us that 'the affix अण् may be added to the words which are the names of <i>Rishis</i>, or of persons belonging to the family of <i>Andhaka</i>, or <i>Vrishinis</i> or <i>Kuru</i>.' The <i>Andhaka</i> family, is a <i>Kshatriya</i> family, and श्वफल्कः is a person of that family. Then श्वफल्क + अङ् = श्वाफल्कः 'a descendent of <i>Svaphalka</i>' This is a <i>Gotra</i> descendent. In forming <i>Yuvan</i> descendent we have श्वाफल्क + इञ्. Now this इञ् must be elided by the present <i>sutra</i>. So that श्वाफल्कः means both father and the son.\n\n3. Now to give an example of <i>Rishis</i> family. The <i>sutra</i> last mentioned (IV. 1. 114.) will also hold here. We take the word वसिष्टः; and वसिष्ट + अण् = वासिष्ठः; the <i>Yuvan</i> affix इञ् will similarly be elided after his; and thus the word वासिष्ठः means both the father and the son.\n\n4. Then to take the example of <i>Gotra</i> word formed by affixes having indicatory ञ्. Thus <i>sutra</i> (IV. 1. 104.) declares 'the affix अञ् comes after the words विद् &c., in denoting <i>Gotra</i> descendents.' Thus विद + अञ् = वैदः; Then add इञ् to denote <i>Yuvan</i> descent, and we have वैदः + इञ्. By the present rule this इञ् is elided and thus we have वैदः both for the father and the son.\n\nThe above examples show the elision of the affix इञ्. Now we shall give example of the elision of the affix अण्. Now rule [[4.1.154]] says 'the affix फिञ् comes after the words तिक् &c., in denoting descendent.' Thus तिक + फिञ् = तैकायनिः (VII. 1. 2.) Then to form the <i>Yuvan</i> descended we add अण् by [[4.1.83]]. Thus तैकायनि + अण्. By the present <i>sutra</i>, this अण् is elided, and we have तैकायनिः both applicable to the father and the son. Other examples can be multiplied.\n\nWhy do we say 'there is elision only after these words'? The <i>Yuvan</i> affix will not be elided after other words. Thus rule [[4.1.112]] says:- 'The affix अण् comes after शिव &c., in forming <i>Gotra</i>. कौहड + अण् = कौहड. Now this is neither a word formed by ण्य nor is it the name of a <i>Kshatriya</i> or a <i>Rishi</i>; nor any affix having ञ goes to form it. Therefore the <i>Yuvan</i> affix इञ् will not be elided after this. Thus कौहड + इञ् [[4.1.95]] कौहडिः 'son of <i>Kauhada</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say 'affix denoting <i>Yuvan</i> descendent is elided'? An affix not denoting a <i>Yuvan</i> descendent will not be elided. Thus the pupils of वामरथ्य are called वामरथ्याः which word is thus formed: वामरथ + ण्य = वामरथ्यः 'a descendent of <i>Vamaratha</i>' [[4.1.115]]. Then to denote pupils we add अण् by [[4.2.111]]. Thus वामरथ्य + अण् = वामरथ्यः 'a pupil of <i>Vamarathya</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say '<i>Yuvan</i> affix अण् and इञ् are elided'? The other <i>Yuvan</i> affixes under similar circumstances are not elided. Thus the <i>Yuvan</i> descendent of दाक्षि (grandson of दक्ष) will be दाक्षायणः Here the affix फक् [[4.1.101]] is not elided.\n\nVart:- All <i>Yuvan</i> affixes are elided after <i>Gotra</i> words not denoting Brahmin <i>Gotras</i>; as वौधिः applies equally to father and son; जाबालिः father, जाबालिः son; औदुम्बरिः father, औदुम्बरिः son; भाण्डीजङ्घेः father, भाण्डीजङ्घेः son. Here, first इङ् is added by [[4.1.173]], then फक् to denote <i>Yuvan</i> descendent. Then this फक् is elided by the present <i>Vartika</i>.",

Some say that the '<i>Paila</i> &c. words are formed by the affix इञ्; [[4.1.95]] and then the <i>luk</i>-elision of the <i>Yuvan</i> affix would be valid by the next rule [[2.4.60]].

Thus, प्रियगार्ग्याः those to whom <i>Gargya</i> is beloved;' प्रियवैदाः 'those to whom <i>Baida</i> is beloved.'\n\nThese affixes will not be elided in the feminine.

    "24065": "Thus the plural of आत्रेय (अत्रि + ढक (IV.1. 122.)) the descendent of अत्रि, is अत्रयः, the regular plural of अत्रि. So also, singular भार्गवः, plural भृगवः, singular कौत्सः, plural कुत्साः; so, वसिष्ठाः, गोतमाः, अङ्गिरसः. In all these the affix has been elided. Thus भृगु + अण् = भार्गवः 'the descendent of <i>Bhrigu</i>.' Of course, it is only in the plural number that the <i>Gotra</i> affixes ढक् and अण् are elided, not in any other number; so we have in singular आत्रेयः भार्गवः; dual आत्रेयौ भार्गवौ; plural आत्रयः भृगवः &c.\n\nBut when these words are part of a compound, the <i>Gotra</i> affixes are not elided in forming their plural.

But यैकिः and पौष्पिः not being polysyllabic, their plural will be यैक्यः and पौष्प्यः.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the <i>Gotra</i> of <i>Prachyas</i> and <i>Bharatas</i>'? Because when denoting the <i>Gotra</i> of any other people, these affixes will not be elided. Thus बालाकयः plural of बालाकिः, हस्तिदासयः plural of हस्तिदासिः.\n\nThough the <i>Bharatas</i> are <i>Prachyas</i>, its specification here is to indicate that, wherever '<i>Prachyas</i>' will be used, it will not include <i>Bharatas</i> as in [[5.4.60]].

    "24084": "उपकुम्भेन or उपकुम्भम् कृतं 'done by <i>upakumbha</i>'; उपकुम्भे निधेहि or उपकुम्भम् निधेहि 'put it in the <i>upakumbha</i>.'\n\nVart:- The अम् substitution is invariable and not optional in the locative case when the <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound denotes prosperity (II. 1.6.) or a compound of rivers [[2.1.20]] and [[2.1.21]] or a compound having a numeral for its member [[2.1.19]]; as, सुमद्रम् 'well or prosperous with the <i>Madras</i>'; सुमगधम् 'well or prosperous with the <i>Magadhas</i>'; similarly उन्मत्तगङ्गम् । लोहितगङ्गम् । एकविंशतिभारद्वाजम् । The word 'diversely' establishes all these even without the <i>Vartika</i>.",
    "24085": "Thus in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> कर्ता 'he will do,' कर्तारौ 'they two will do;' कर्तारः 'they will do.' So also in the <i>Atmanepada</i> we have अध्येता, अध्येतारौ, अध्येतारः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'in the 3rd person'? Observe श्वः कर्तासि । श्वोऽध्येतासे ॥",
    "31001": "This is an aphorism intended solely to regulate the sense of others. From this place forward up to the end of the Fifth Book, whatsoever we shall treat of, will get the name of '<i>Pratyaya</i>' or an affix, except the '<i>prakriti</i>' or base (such as गुप्, तिम्, कित् in (III. I. 5) are bases, the affix being सन्), the '<i>upapada</i>' or dependent word (such as स्तम्ब, शकृत in [[3.2.24]] are <i>upapadas</i>), the '<i>upadhi</i>' or attribute, the special cause that occasions changes (such as पशु in III. 2. 25 is an <i>upadhi</i>); in the sutra, [[3.2.25]], the word हरति is a <i>prakriti</i>, दृति and नाथ are <i>upapadas</i>, पशु is an <i>upadhi</i>, the affix being इन्, the substitute and the augment. Such as the affixes तव्यत्, तव्य, अनीयर् taught in (III. I. 96), as कर्त्तव्यम्, करणीयम् 'to be done'.",
    "31002": "This is also an '<i>adhikara</i>' or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a '<i>paribhasha</i>' or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the '<i>dhatu</i>' or root, or the '<i>pratipadika</i>' or crude form; as कर्त्तव्यम् and तैत्तिरीयम्.\n\nThe force of the word च 'and' in this <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that the affixes here treated of, are to be placed after a root &c.; not so, however the affixes, may sometimes, be placed in the beginning or the middle of a word.",
    "31003": "This <i>sutra</i> may also be treated as a <i>Paribhasha</i> or an <i>Adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. The <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the affix, and if it consists of more than one vowel, then on the first of the vowels. Thus the affix तव्य has <i>udatta</i> on the first अ as in कर्त्तव्यम्. This general rule of accent applies only where there is no special rule laid down. Thus, rule (VI. I.163), declares that affixes having an indicatory च will have <i>udatta</i> on the final; those having an indicatory र have accent on the middle (VI.I.217); those that have an indicatory प are <i>anudatta</i>; those having an indicatory ज, throw the acute accent on the syllable immediately preceding the affix (VI.I.193); the affixes having an indicatory प्र and न throw the acute accent on the first syllable of the word to which they are added (VI.I.197); the <i>taddhita</i> affix having an indicatory क  takes acute accent on the final (VI.I.165); and the affix having an indicatory त is <i>svarita</i> (VI.I.185).",
    "31004": "This is an exception (<i>apavada</i>) to the last aphorism. As दृसदौ 'two stones'; the case-affix औ is <i>anudatta</i>; so also तृपदः; so also पचति; The third person singular affix तिप् has an indicatory प, and is <i>anudatta</i>. But not पचतः.",
    "31005": "This affix is to be added to the above verbs, when they mean to 'despise', 'to endure' and 'to heal' respectively, though they ordinarily mean 'to hide', 'to whet' and 'to dwell'. As जुगुप्सते 'he censures or despises'; तितिक्षते 'he endures patiently'; चिकित्सते 'he heals'. But गोपायति 'he protects'; तेजयति 'he sharpens'; सङ्केतयति 'he makes sign'. When सन् is added, there is reduplication of the root, by (VI.I.9). Thus, गुप् + सन् = जुगुप् + स [[7.4.62]] = जुगुप्स् to which is added the third person singular termination अते = जुगुप्सते.",
    "31006": "The सन् is to be added only then, when the sense of the desiderative verb is as below: मीमांसते 'he investigates', बीभस्सते 'he loathes', दीदांसते 'he  straightens', शीशांसते 'he sharpens'. The verbs given in this and the preceding <i>sutra</i>, are Desiderative in form, but not in meaning. The word 'optionally' in the next <i>sutra</i>, may be read into this also, whereby the addition of सन् becomes optional. Thus मानयति, बाधयति, दानयति and निशानयति are also valid forms.",
    "31007": "As, कृ 'to do'; चिकीर्षति = कर्तुमिच्छति 'he wishes to do'. This is the Desiderative proper. It is optional to employ the desiderative affix, the same sense may be expressed by a phrase. The root must also be simple and not compounded with any <i>upasarga</i>, when the affix सन् is to be added. Thus प्रकर्तुमैच्छत् = प्राचिकीर्षत्.\n\nWhy do we say कर्मणः 'after (a root expressing) an object'? The affix will not come after an Instrumental case. Thus गमनेनैच्छति; here there is no affix. But गन्तुमिच्छति will be जिगमिषति.\n\nWhy do we say समानकर्तृकात् 'when the subject of the verb to wish, is also the subject of the verb denoted by the object wished' ? Observe देवदत्तस्य भोजनमिच्छति यज्ञदत्तः. Here Yajnadatta is agent of the verb इच्छति; but he is not agent of the action भोजनं; hence there is no affixing.\n\nWhy do we say इच्छायाम् 'when the sense is that of wishing'? Observe कर्तुं जानाति 'he knows how to make'; here the sense being that of knowing, there is no affix.\n\nThe word वा 'optionally' shows that a sentence may also be employed to express the same idea. Thus कर्तुमिच्छति or चिकीर्षति.\n\nThe word धातोः being especially used in this <i>sutra</i>, shows that this सन् is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix, while the सन् taught in the two preceding <i>sutras</i>, will not get this designation.\n\nVart: The affix सन् is added, when the sense is that of 'in imminent danger'; as शङ्के पतिष्यति कूलम् = पिपतिषति कूलम् 'the bank is in imminent danger of falling down'. So also श्वा मुमूर्षति.\n\nVart: There is no affixing of सन् after a verb which has alrcady taken सन् in the sense of wishing. As चिकीर्षितुमिच्छति. But the सन् of (III. I. 5, 6) not denoting wishing, we have जुगुप्सिषते, मिमांसिषते.",
    "31008": "This forms the Denominative verbs, i.e., verbs derived from nominal bases. As, पुत्र 'son', पुत्रीयति 'he wishes for a son of his own' (पुत्र + क्यच् = पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय) [[2.4.71]], [[7.4.33]].\n\nWhy do we use the word सुप् ? The affix should not come after a whole sentence, but only after the particular word ending in the case-affix. Thus in महान्तं पुत्रमिच्छति, the affix comes only after पुत्रम् and not महान्तं पुत्रं.\n\nWhy do we say <i>atmanah</i> ? Observe राज्ञः पुत्रमिच्छति 'he wishes a son for the king'. Here there is no affixing as the wishing is for another and not for one's own self.\n\nThe क in क्यच् is for the sake of classing <i>kyach</i>, <i>kyan</i> and <i>kyash</i> in one common group by simply using the word क्य, as in <i>sutra</i> तः क्ये [[1.4.15]]; while च् distinguishes <i>kyach</i> from <i>kyan</i> &c., and is not for the sake of accent, the affix will be <i>udatta</i> by [[3.1.3]].\n\nVart:- In affixing <i>kyach</i>, prohibition must be stated of pronouns in म् and of Indeclinables. Thus in इदमिच्छति, उच्चैरिच्छति, there is no affixing.\n\nVart:- In the Vedas, the affix is added even when the wish is with regard to another. As मा त्वा वृका अघायवो विदन्. Here अघायु (pl. अघायवः) is formed by <i>kyach</i>, अ being added by [[3.2.170]], and आ is added by [[7.4.37]]. See Rig Veda (I. 120.7; 27.3) &c.",
    "31009": "Thus, पुत्रकाम्यति 'he wishes for a son of his own'.\n\nThe making of this a separate <i>sutra</i> instead of adding it with the last aphorism and making one <i>sutra</i> of them both, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, where the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>kyach</i> only runs, and not that of <i>kamyach</i>. The क of <i>kamyach</i> is not indicatory, but is a part of the real affix. Here, therefore, rule [[1.3.8]] which would have made the letter क indicatory, does not apply; because no particular purpose would be served by making indicatory. Or the affix <i>kamyach</i> may be considered to have an indicatory च before it i.e. the affix being <i>chakamya</i>.",
    "31010": "Thus, पुत्रमिवाचरति छात्रं = पुत्रीयति छात्रम् 'he treats the pupil as a son'\n\nVart: So also in a locative case. As प्रासादीयति कुड्ये 'he dwells in hut as if it were a palace'. पर्यङ्कीयति मञ्चके 'in a cot he lies down as if he were on a royal bedstead; he treats a cot as a royal bedstead'.",
    "31011": "Thus, श्येनेवाचरति काकः, श्येनायते, 'the crow behaves like a hawk'; अप्सरायते 'she behaves like an <i>Apsara</i>'; पयस्यते or पयायते 'it becomes milk'; (श्येन + य = श्येना + य = श्येनाय, [[7.4.25]]).\n\nIn the words ओजस् — औजायते, and अप्सरस् — अप्सरायते the final स् is invariably elided when forming the denominative verb : but not so in the case of पयस् where the elision is optional, as पयायते or पयस्यते.\n\nThe elision of स् refers to the final स् and not when it is followed by any vowel. Thus हंस — हंसायते; सारस — सारसायते; here the स is not elided as it is not final. See. [[1.1.52]].\n\nVart:- After the words अवगल्भ, क्लीब, and होड, the affix क्विप् is optionally added in the sense of behaving like some one or some thing. As अवगल्भते or अवगल्भायते, क्लीबते or क्लीबायते, होडते or होडायते. The alternative forms are derived by the affixing of <i>kyan</i>.\n\nVart:- According to the opinion of some Grammarians, the affix क्विप् comes optionally in this sense after all crude nouns. As अश्वति or अश्वायते, गर्दभति or गर्दभायते.",
    "31012": "Thus, अभृशो भृशो भवति = भृशायते 'he becomes much (from a little)'; शीघ्रायते 'he becomes swift (from being tardy)'. All these roots will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> [[1.3.12]].\n\nThe phrase अच्वेः 'not ending in the adverbial affix ई', refers to every one of the words belonging to the class भ्रिशादि. It may be objected, what was the necessity of adding this condition, since the affix च्वि itself denotes that something has become what it was not before; and therefore a word which has taken the affix च्वि, will not again take क्यङ् in that very sense. The repetition of च्वि here shows that the words भृश् &c. never take the affix च्वि, in the sense of 'something becoming what it was not before'. Thus the present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.50]] which ordains च्वि.\n\nभृशादिः\n\nभृश्, शीघ्, मन्द, चपल, पण्डित, उत्सुक, उन्मनस्, अभिमनस्, सुमनस्, दुर्म्मनस्, रहस्, रोहस्, शश्वत्, वहत्, वहेत्, नृपत्, शुधि, अधर, ओजस्, वर्चस्, (विमनस्, रभन्, रोहत्, हन्, शुचिस्, अरजस्) ।",
    "31013": "Thus लोहितायते or लोहितायति 'he becomes red'; पटपटायते or पटपटायति 'he makes a noise like <i>patapata</i>'; (लोहित + य = लोहिता + य = लोहिताय, [[7.4.25]]).\n\nThe word पटपटायते is formed by adding the affix <i>dach</i> to the word पट which is first reduplicated, and then takes the denominative affix <i>kyash</i>. The affix <i>dach</i> is added to express inarticulate sounds.\n\nThere is no special class called <i>lohitadi</i>. The <i>Vartika</i>, therefore, proposes that the <i>sutra</i> should read without the word <i>adi</i>, as लोहितादिभ्यः क्यष्; 'the affix <i>kyash</i> comes after <i>lohita</i>, and words ending in <i>dach</i>'.\n\nThis rule applies to words other than भ्रिशादि which are always invariably <i>Atmanepadi</i> owing to the ङित्, affix क्यङ्, while क्यष् is optionally both. [[1.3.90]]. Thus वर्मायति or वर्मायते, निद्रायति or निद्रायते, करुणायति or करुणायते, कृपायति or कृपायते. The <i>lohitadi</i> is an आकृतिगण, the following being some of the words of this class; लोहित, नील, हरित, पीत, मद्र, फेन and मन्द.\n\nThe indicatory क in क्यष् is not for the sake of prohibiting <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> [[1.1.5]]. For <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> takes place in a <i>dhatu</i> followed by a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> or <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. The affix क्यष् is not added to a <i>dhatu</i> but to a nominal stem : hence there is no scope for the operation of <i>guna</i> &c. The क is for the sake of grouping क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यष् in one class as क्य; as in <i>sutra</i> नः क्ये [[1.4.15]]. There is, however, no word ending in न among those enumerated above.\n\nThe affix डाच् [[5.4.57]] comes when the verb following is one of the three अस्, भू, or कृ; as पटपटाकरोति, -भवति or -स्यात्. The present <i>sutra</i> teaches by implication that when क्यष् follows डाच्, the above restriction, that the verb should be कृ, भू or अस्, is not applicable. Here डाच् comes without the addition of कृ, भू or अस्ति.\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of अच्वेः comes from the last <i>sutra</i>; and hence the affix मयप् is added in the sense of अभूततद्भाव i.e. something becoming that which it was not before.",
    "31014": "Thus, कष्टाय कर्मणे क्रामति = कष्टायते 'he is assiduous for trouble, i.e. he is assiduous in the commission of dishonesty, or he plots'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्यङ्, comes in the sense of exerting in evil, after the words सत्र, कष्ट, कक्ष, कृच्छ्र and गहन; as, सत्रायते, कष्टायते, कक्षायते, कृच्छ्रायते, and गहनायते ।\n\nWhen the sense is not of 'evil', the affix is not added, as अजः कष्टं क्रामति.",
    "31015": "Thus, रोमन्थं वर्तयति = रोमन्थायते गौः 'the cow ruminates'.\n\nVart: This is restricted to the word signifying movements of the jaws. Therefore there is no affixing here; as, कीटो रोमन्थं वर्तयति.\n\nVart:The <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes are used after the word तपस्; as तपश्चरति = तपस्यति, 'he performs austerity'.",
    "31016": "Thus, बाष्पायते 'it emits vapour'; उष्मायते 'it sends out heat'. So also फेनायते 'it ejects froth'.",
    "31017": "Thus, शब्दं करोति = शब्दायते 'he makes a noise'. So also वैरायते, कलहायते, अभ्रायते, कण्वायते, मेघायते ।\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the affix comes after सुदिन, दुर्दिन and नीहार; as, सुदिनायते, दुर्दिनायते, नीहारायते ।\n\nVart:- So also should be included the words अटा, अट्टा, शीका, कोटा, पोटा सोटा and कष्टा; as अटायते, अट्टायते, शीकायते, कोटायते, पोटायते, सोटायते and कष्टायते ।\n\nThe word करण in the <i>sutra</i> is not the Grammatical <i>Karana</i> or the Instrumental case, but has here its primary meaning of 'doing'.",
    "31018": "Thus सुखायते ' he feels pleasure';  दुःखायते 'he feels pain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the feeling belongs to the agent'? Observe सुखं वेदयति प्रसाधको देवदत्तस्य 'the valet knows the happiness of his master Devadatta'.  Here the agent viz. a valet, is not the percipient of the 'happiness', which belongs to his master; hence there is no affixing.\n\nसुखादिः।\n\nसुख, दुःख, तृप्त, गहन, कृच्छ्र, अस्, अलीक, प्रतीप, करुण, कृपण, सोट ।",
    "31019": "Thus नमस्यति देवान्, 'he worships the gods'; वरिवस्यति गुरून्, 'he honors or serves the elders'; चित्रीयते 'he astonishes (makes it wonderful)'. The ङ् in चित्रङ् indicates that it takes the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i>. (चित्र + य = चित्री + य [[7.4.33]] = चित्रीय).",
    "31020": "Thus उत्पुच्छयते 'he lifts up the tail', (the sense must be that of lifting or throwing about); सम्भाण्डायते 'he collects pots in a heap'; सञ्चीवरायते भिक्षुः 'the beggar collects or wears rags'. Of the affix णिङ्, the effective portion is इ, the other letters are servile. The ङ indicates <i>Atmanepada</i> [[1.3.12]]and ण serves the purposes of the application of the rule [[6.4.51]] which applies generally to all affixes containing णि, such as णिङ्, णिच् &c.\n\nVart:- After the word पुच्छ् the sense of the affix is that of lifting or throwing about.\n\nVart:- After भाण्ड the sense of the affix is that of accumulation in a heap.\n\nVart:- After चीवर the sense of the affix is that of acquiring or wearing.",
    "31021": "Thus मुण्डयति 'he shaves'; मिश्रयति 'he mixes'; श्लक्ष्णयति 'he softens or alleviates'; लवणयति 'he salts'; पयोव्रतयति 'he fasts on milk'; संवस्त्रयति 'he covers with clothes i.e. dresses'; हलयति 'he ploughs'; कलयति 'he makes war'; कृतयति 'he appreciates kindness'; वितूस्तयति 'he combs the hair, or disentangles matted hair or delivers from sin'.\n\nThe affix after the word व्रत has the sense of 'eating' or 'abstaining therefrom'; as पयो व्रतयति 'he drinks milk', वृषलान्नं व्रतयति 'he abstains from the food prepared by a low caste'; after the word वस्त्र the affix denotes the sense of covering. After हलि and कलि the sense is that of taking; as हलिं गृह्णाति = हलयति. The words in the <i>sutra</i> are हल and कल and not हलि and कलि. This anomalous form shows that in forming the Aorist of these by adding the affix चङ् (III. I. 48) the reduplication takes place, but not in the same way as if the affix were सम्, i.e. the सन्वद्भाव does not take place here in the Aorist [[7.4.93]]. Thus the Aorists are अजहलत् and अचकलत्; and not अजीहलत् and अचीकलत् which would have been the forms by the application of rules (VII.4.79. & 94). if there was सन्वद्भाव.\n\nThe word स्तूत means either hair, or matted hair, or sin.",
    "31022": "The phrase <i>kriya-samabhihara</i> means repetition of the act or its intensity. As पच् 'to cook', पापच्यते 'he cooks again and again'; जाज्वल्यते 'he shines with great intensity'. The root must be a simple root, and not compounded with any <i>upasarga</i>. We cannot therefore make Intensives of verbs like प्राट् 'to go', (because the root अट्, is preceded by the <i>upasarga</i> प्र); or जागृ 'to be awake,' (because it contains two vowels); or ईक्ष् 'to see' (because it begins with a vowel).\n\nVart:- The intensive affix यङ् comes after सुचि, सूत्रि, मूत्रि, अटि, अर्ति, अश and अर्ण, though some of these contain more than two vowels and others begin with a vowel.\n\nAs, सोसूच्यते, सोसूत्र्यते, मोमूत्र्यते, अटाट्यते, अरार्यते, अशाश्यते, and पोर्णोनूयते.\n\nThe affix is not added in these cases भृशं शोभते or भृशं रोचते, as it is against usage to make Intensive forms of these verbs on the sense of intensity, though in the sense of repetition we have रोरुच्यते and शोशुभ्यते.\n\nIn making the Intensives, the root is reduplicated and it takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> as the root is ङित्.",
    "31023": "Thus क्रम् 'to move', चङ्क्रम्यते 'he moves crookedly'. So also दन्द्रम्यते. After a verb of motion, the यङ् never expresses intensity or repetition; so if the latter sense is to be expressed, a phrase must be employed; as भृशं क्रामति 'he wanders much'. This is inferred from the word नित्य used in the <i>sutra</i> i. e. यङ् always has the sense of crookedness and no other sense after a verb of motion.",
    "31024": "Thus लोलुप्यते 'he cuts off badly'; सासद्यते 'he sits badly'; चञ्चूर्यते 'he walks badly'; जञ्जप्यते 'he recites badly' ; so also जञ्जभ्यते, दन्दह्यते, दन्दश्यते, निजेगिल्यते. The affix यङ्, does not come in the sense of repetition &c. after the above verbs, but only in the sense of censurable performance of the action denoted by the verbs. Separate words must be used to express the intensive or the frequentative meaning. As भृशं लुम्पति 'he cuts off much'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when contempt in regard to the sense of the root is meant'? Observe साधु जपति 'he recites well'. There is no affixing as no contempt is denoted. Why do we say 'in regard to the action denoted by the root'? When the contempt is not with regard to the sense of the root, but with regard to the action as accomplished, the affix is not employed. Thus मन्त्रं जपति वृषलः 'the <i>Sudra</i> recites the sacred <i>mantras</i>'. The word नित्य of the last aphorism is understood here also.",
    "31025": "Thus सत्यापयति 'he speaks truly'; विपाशयति 'he unfetters or liberates'; रूपयति 'he looks'; उपवीणयति 'he sings with the lute'; अनुतूलयति 'he makes a brush'; उपश्लोकयति 'he praises in verse'; अभिषेणयति 'he advances with the army'; अनोलोमयति 'he rubs over the hair'; त्वचयति 'he feels of the skin'; संवर्मयति 'he puts on the mail armour'; वर्णयति 'he celebrates or colors'; अवचूर्णयति he pulverises. The roots of the <i>Churadi</i> class belong to the tenth conjugation, for a list of which see the <i>Dhatupatha</i>. After the verbs of the <i>Churadi</i> class, the affix णिच् is employed without alteration of the sense; as चोरयति 'he steals'. So also चिन्तयति.\n\nVart:- The words अर्थ, वेद and सत्य take the augment आप् before the affix णिच्; as, सत्यापयति, अर्थापयति, वेदापयति. The whole equation is thus shown अर्थ + आपुक् + णिच् + शप् + तिप् = अर्थ +  आप्+ इ +अति = अर्थापि + अति = अर्थापयति [[7.3.85]]. The final syllable called टि is not elided in this case, i.e. of अर्थाप् the syllable आप् is not elided before णिच्, as it would have been by [[6.4.155]]. The reason is that if आप् was to be elided, there would have been no necessity of adding it. The affix णिच् has the sense of 'unfettering' after the word पाश, of 'seeing' after रूप, of 'singing in accompaniment' after वीणा, of 'brushing' after तूल, of 'praising' after श्लोक, of 'leading' after सेना, of 'rubbing' after लोम, of 'taking' after स्वच्, of 'putting on' after वर्म and of 'taking' after वर्ण.",
    "31026": "The <i>hetu</i> [[1.4.55]] means the mover of the independent agent; an operation relating to the <i>hetu</i>, such as directing &c. is called <i>hetumat</i>; as कठं कारयति 'he causes to prepare a mat'; ओदनं पाचवति 'he makes the rice to be cooked'. In other words, the affix णिच् forms the causative verbs.\n\nVart:- The affix comes also in the sense of 'he does that' after the words सूत्र &c. Thus सत्रं करोति = सूत्रयति 'he makes <i>sutra</i>' So also सूत्रयति.\n\nVart:- After words ending in कृत् affixes and describing legends, comes the affix णिच्, when the sense is 'he does that'. The कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic (प्राकृतिक) form, and the base is as if the agent, thus कंसवधिमाचष्टे = कंसं घातयति; बलिबन्धमाचष्टे = बलिं बन्धयति; राजागमनमाचष्टे = राजानम् आगमयति.\n\nVart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the last वार्तिक, the <i>upasarga</i> आ is elided, when duration of time is meant expressing limit. Thus आरात्रिविवासं आचष्टे = रात्रिं विवासयति; here the आ of आरात्रि is elided.\n\nVart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the second <i>vartika</i> the affix णिच् has the sense of 'making wonderful', 'meaning attaining that'. Thus उज्जयिन्याः प्रस्थितो माहिष्मत्यां सूर्योद्गमनं सम्भावयते = सूर्यमुद्गमयति 'going from <i>Ujjain</i> he finds the sun rise in <i>Mahismati</i> (wonderful speed)'.\n\nVart :- When an asterism is in composition and the sense is that of knowing, there comes the affix णिच् after a word ending in कृत् affix, the कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic form and the base is as if the agent. Thus पुष्ययोगं जानाति = पुष्येण योजयति. So also मघाभिर्योजयति.",
    "31027": "Thus, कण्डूयति or कण्डूयते 'he itches or scratches'. This word takes terminations indicatory. The words कण्डु &c. are both roots and nouns, and are placed therefore in a separate list by themselves and are not included in the general list of verbs. The affix applies to those words as roots and not as nouns.\n\nकण्ड्वादिः ।\n\nकण्डूञ्, मन्तु, ह्रणीञ्, वल्गु, अस्त्र, मनस्, महीङ्, लेट्, लोट्, इरस्, इरज्, इरञ्, द्रवस्, मेधा, कुषुभ, मगध, तन्तस्, पम्पस्, सुख, दुःख, सपर, अर, भिषज्, भिष्णज्, इषुध, चरण, चुरण, भुरण, तुरण, गद्गद, एला, केला, खेला, लिट् and लोट् ।",
    "31028": "Thus गोपायति 'he protects'; धूपायति 'he heats'; so also, विच्छायति, पणायति, and पनायति.\n\nThe verb पण् being read along with पन् 'to praise,' has here the sense of praise only; so that the affix does not come after the verb पण् when it means 'to make a contract'; as शतस्य पणते, सहस्रस्य पणते.\n\nThe verbs in आय do not take <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes, as there is no indicatory letter to show that.",
    "31029": "The indicatory ङ shows that the verb will take the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i>; as ऋतीयते 'he pities or reproaches'; so also, ऋतीयाते, ऋतीयन्ते.",
    "31030": "The ण indicates <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.115]] and ङ shows <i>Atmanepada</i>; as, कामयते 'he desires'; so also कामयेते and कामयन्ते.",
    "31031": "Thus ता 3rd. sing. of the Future is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. It is optional to retain the <i>aya</i> of <i>gopaya</i> before this affix. So we have गोपायिता or गोप्ता 'he will protect'. So also अर्तिता or ऋतीयिता; कमिता or कामयिता.\n\nBut for this <i>sutra</i>, the affixes आय &c. would have come always even when <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes were to be applied. This makes it optional. Therefore proper <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes should be applied when we retain आय &c. and when we do not retain them. Thus the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> क्तिन् [[3.3.95]] will be employed in forming the feminine noun from the simple root, but the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> अ [[3.3.102]] will be employed in forming the feminine when आय &c. are retained. Thus गुप्तिः or गोपावा.",
    "31032": "This extends the sphere of <i>Dhatu</i> or roots already defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.1]]. These roots may be called derivative roots. They are separate independent roots, and have all the functions of a root, as taking tense-affixes &c. as shown in the above examples. Thus चिकीर्षा 'to wish to do', कारि 'to cause to do'; चेक्रिय 'to do repeatedly' are separate roots and not the same as कृ 'to do' and thus take शप् &c.",
    "31033": "लृ is the common expression for लृङ् and लृट् formed by rejecting their special <i>anubandhas</i>, and means therefore the 2nd Future and the Conditional tenses. लुट् is the 1st Future also called the Periphrastic Future. Thus करिष्यति अकरिष्यत्, कर्ता. The इ of तासि is indicatory and shows that the nasal of the root is not to be dropped before this; as मन् 'to think', मन्ता 'he will think'.",
    "31034": "The tense called लेट् or subjunctive is found in the <i>Vedas</i> only. When the subjunctive tense is employed, the affix सिप् is diversely added.\n\nThus जोषिषत्, तारिषत्, मन्दिषत्. Sometimes this augment is not employed; thus पताति दिद्युत् उदधिं ज्यावयाति. Thus in <i>Rig Veda</i> (I. I. 2), वक्षति is an example of लेट् with सिप् ॥",
    "31035": "This forms the Periphrastic Perfect. The Perfect of कास् will be कासाम्, after which the terminations of the Perfect are all elided [[2.4.81]] and instead, the perfect tense of the auxiliary verb भू or अस् is added. As कासाञ्चक्रे 'he coughed'; चोरयामास 'he stole'. So also लोलूवाञ्चक्रे.\n\nThis rule however does not apply to the <i>Vedas</i>; as कृष्णो नोनाव <i>Rig. Veda</i> (I. 79.2).\n\nVart:- This rule also applies where the root is polysyllabic consisting of more than one vowel; as चुलुम्पाञ्चकार, दरिद्राञ्चकार ॥\n\nThe final म् of आम् is not indicatory.",
    "31036": "Thus ईह् 'to try', ईहाञ्चक्रे 'he tried'; so also ऊहाञ्चक्रे 'he guessed', एधाञ्चक्रे 'he grieved'.\n\nBut ऋच्छ् forms आनर्च्छ 'he failed or went'. This applies to monosyllabic roots which begin with any vowel prosodially long, except अ or आ. The verb ऊर्ण 'to cover' is, however, an exception; its perfect is ऊर्णुनाव 'he covered'.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with इच् or any vowel except अ or आ' ? Observe अर्द, Perfect आनर्द [[7.4.71]]. Why do we say 'heavy vowel' ? Observe उख्, Perf. उवोख [[6.4.78]] ऊखतुः, ऊखुः. Why do we say 'vowel' ? Observe कुर्द, Perf. चुकुर्दे; षूद्, Perf. सुषूदे.",
    "31037": "Thus दयाञ्चके 'he gave'; पलायाञ्चक्रे 'he ran away'; आसाञ्चक्रे 'he sat'.",
    "31038": "Thus ओषाञ्चकार or उवोष, विदाञ्चकार or विवेद, जागराञ्चकार or जजागार. As there is an agreement in the present instance to regard the verb विद as ending in a short अ, <i>guna</i> is not substituted, as it would otherwise have been by rule [[7.3.86]].",
    "31039": "The effect of श्लु is to cause reduplication by rule [[6.1.10]]. As विभयाञ्चकार or विभाय, जिह्रवाञ्चकार or जिह्राय, विभराञ्चकार or बभार, जुहवाञ्चकार or जुहाव.",
    "31040": "After the above verbs formed by taking the augment आम् the perfect tense of कृ is added to form their Perfect. This has already been illustrated in the above examples. The word कृ includes also the verbs भू and अस्. All these three may be used as auxiliaries. The verb अस् when used as an auxiliary, is not replaced by भू [[3.4.52]] before the लिट् affixes which are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Thus पाचयाञ्चकार, पाचयाम्बभूव, पाचयामास.",
    "31041": "This irregular form is obtained by adding the affix आम् to the root विद् 'to know,' when followed by लोट् or the Imperative tense; the tense-affixes of लोट् are then elided by <i>luk</i>; moreover there is no substitution of <i>guna</i> as required by [[7.3.86]]; and when we have thus obtained the form विदाम्, we annex to it the लोट् of the verb कृ; thus we have विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु or विदन्तु 'let them know'. The third person plural is not only intended to be spoken of by the employment of the form विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु in the aphorism; on the contrary, the word इति shows that all the numbers and persons of the Imperative may be so employed; as विदाङ्करोतु विदाङ्कुरुताम् &c.",
    "31042": "The first two of these and the fourth are the Aorists (लुङ्) of the causatives of the roots सद् 'to sit', जन् 'to be born', and रम् 'to sport': to which the affix आम् is added. The third is the Aorist of the root चि 'to collect', to which आम् has been added after the reduplication and the change of च into क of the root. The auxiliary अकः is added to all these four. The fifth is derived from the root पू 'to blow, to purify', by adding the causative affix णिच्, annexing the affix आम् before the terminations of the Potential (लिङ्) and then using after the form so obtained, the auxiliary क्रियात्. The last is the Aorist of विद् 'to know', to which आम् is added and the auxiliary अक्रन् is employed. These are the archaic forms; their modern forms are as follow:- अभ्युदसीषदत्, प्राजीजनत्, अचैषीत्, अरीरमत्, पाव्याद, अवेदिषुः ।",
    "31043": "The इ of च्लि is for the sake of articulation, the च is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 162.) showing that an affix which has an indicatory च has <i>udatta</i> on its final. Then remains only लि, which after all, is to be replaced by other affixes, as we shall show below. In fact च्लि is the common name for all Aorist affixes.",
    "31044": "The इ of सिच् is for the sake of pronunciation, the च is for accent, and the real affix is स्; as अकार्षीत् 'he did'. When सिच् is added, the terminations of the Aorist assume the following forms.\n\n<i>Parasmaipada</i>.\n\n- 1st person, सं, स्व, स्म  \n- 2nd person, सीः, स्तं, तं, स्त, त\n- 3rd person, सीत्, स्तां, तां, सुः\n\n<i>Atmanepada</i>.\n\n- 1st person, सि, स्वहि, स्महि\n- 2nd person, स्थाः, थाः, साथां, ध्वं\n- 3rd person, स्त, त, सातां, सत\n\nThe substitution of सिच् is optional in the Aorist of the roots स्पृश् 'to touch', मृश् 'to rub', कृष् 'to plough', तृप् 'to become satisfied', and दृप् 'to light'. Thus the Aorist of स्पृश् has three forms; अस्प्राक्षीत्; अस्पार्क्षीत्, or अस्पृक्षत्. Similarly मृश् has अम्राक्षीत्, अमार्क्षीत् or अमृक्षत्; कृष्, अकार्षीत् अक्राक्षीत् or अकृक्षत्; तृप्, अतार्प्सीत्, अत्राप्सीत्, or अतृपत्; दृप्, अद्राप्सीत्, अदार्प्सीत् or अदृपत् ।",
    "31045": "The forms of the terminations of the Aorist with क्स are as follow:\n\n<i>Parasmaipada</i>.\n\n- 1st person, सं, साव, साम्\n- 2nd person, सः, सत, सत\n- 3rd person, सत्, सतां, सत्\n\n<i>Almanepada</i>.\n\n- सि, सीवहि, सीमहि\n- सथाः, थाः, साथाम्, सध्वम्, ध्वम्\n- सत, त, सातां, सन्त\n\nAs, मृश and कृष् in the last <i>sutra</i> have their Aorist with क्स as अमृक्सत् and अकृषत्; so दुह 'to milk' forms अधुक्षत् 'he milked', लिड् 'to lick' अलिक्षत्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when ending in श, ष, and ह'? Observe अभैत्सीत्, अच्छैत्सीत्; here सिच् is employed. Why do we say 'having for its penultimate इ, उ, ऋ or लृ'? Observe अधाक्षीत्. Why do we say 'not having an intermediate इ'? Observe अकोषीत् an अमोषीत्. See [[7.2.4]] and [[8.2.28]].",
    "31046": "This is a restrictive aphorism. As आश्लिक्षत् कन्याम् 'he embraced the girl'. But समाश्लिषज्जतुकाष्ठम् 'the glue joined the wood'.",
    "31047": "This is an exception to the <i>sutra</i> (III. 1.45.) enjoining क्स. The root दृश् will form its Aorists by (III. I. 57.) and will take अङ् and सिच्; as अदर्शत् or अद्राक्षीत् 'he saw'.",
    "31048": "The ङ prevents <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> and च is to distinguish it from अङ्. When चङ् is added, there is reduplication (VI. I. II). The usual terminations of the Imperfect are employed after the root, when चङ् is used; as अचीकरत् 'he caused to make'; अशिश्रियत् 'he served or went'; अदुद्रुवत् 'he ran'; असुस्रुवत् 'it flowed'. This form is not used in Passive; as, अकारयिषाताम्.\n\nThe root कम् 'to love' should also be included in this rule. कम्, when it takes the affix णिङ् (III. I. 30) will of course be included in this <i>sutra</i>, by virtue of its ending in णि; the <i>Vartika</i> makes the additional statement that even when the root कम् does not take the affix णिङ्, the present aphorism must apply to it. Thus we have अचकमत् 'he loved'; when it takes णिङ्, the Aorist will be अचीकमत् (VII. 4. 93, 79, 94.)",
    "31049": "As, अदधत्, 'he sucked'. When it takes the alternative सिच्, then rule (II. 4. 78.) comes into operation, and we have अधात् and अधासीत् 'he sucked'. So also of श्वि, we have अशिश्वियत् 'he grew'. It also takes the अङ्, (III. I. 58) and then its form is अश्वत् or अश्वयीत्.",
    "31050": "This rule applies where the root गुप् does not take the affix आय (II. I. 28). As इमान् नो मित्रावरुणौ यत् गृहान् अजुगुपतम् '<i>Mitra</i> <i>Varuna</i> protected these our houses'. The other forms are अगौप्तम्, अगोपिष्टम् or आगोपायिष्टम्. In the secular literature, the latter three forms are used, but not the first.",
    "31051": "Thus we have ऊनयीः in the <i>Vedas</i>; औनिनस् in the classical literature; so also ध्वनयीत्, ऐलयीः and अर्दयीत्; their classical forms being अदिध्वनत् , ऐलिलत्, an आर्दिदत्. See <i>Rig Veda</i> (I. 53, 3), (I. 162. 15.) and <i>Panini</i> (VII 2. 5).",
    "31052": "वच् may be either the root, or the substitute of ब्रू [[2.4.53]] and so also ख्या may be the root, or the substitute of चक्ष् [[2.4.54]]. The root अस् belonging to the दिवादि or the Fourth conjugation, falls under the subdivision पुषादि, and therefore it would have taken अङ् in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> by rule (III. I. 55). The repetition is to indicate that it takes अङ्, in the <i>Atamanepada</i> also; as पर्यास्थत [[7.4.17]], अवोचत् and आख्यत्. In the Passive, we have पर्यासिषाताम्.",
    "31053": "Thus अलिपत् 'he painted or wrote'; असिचत्, 'he sprinkled; and आहूत् 'he called or challenged'.",
    "31054": "Thus अलिपत or अलिप्त 'he painted'; असिचत or असिक्त 'he sprinkled'; आह्वत or आह्वास्त 'he challenged'.",
    "31055": "The verbs classed as पुषादि, are a sub-division of the 4th conjugational verbs; and द्युतादि verbs belong to the Ist conjugation. As पुष्, अपुषत् 'he nourished'; द्युत्, अद्युतत् 'he shone'; गम्लृ, अगमत् 'he went'. But not so in the <i>Atmanepada</i>; as व्यद्योतिष्ट, अलोतिष्ट.",
    "31056": "Thus असरत् 'he went'; अशिषत् 'he ordered'; आरत् 'he went'. This <i>sutra</i> has been separately enunciated in order to make the rule applicable to <i>Atmanepada</i>; as समरन्त [[1.3.29]]. The च in the text is for the sake of drawing the <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrase 'in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>' of the last <i>sutra</i>, into the present and its <i>anuvriti</i> will extend to future <i>sutras</i> also.",
    "31057": "Thus from भिदिर् (भिद) 'to divide', we derive अभिदत् or अभैत्सीत्. But we have अभित्त in the <i>Atmanepada</i>. So from छिदिर् — अच्छिदत् or अच्छैत्सीत्.",
    "31058": "Thus अजरत् or अजारीत् 'he grew old'; अस्तम्भत् or अस्तम्भीत् 'he stiffened'; अम्रुचत् or अम्रोचीत् 'he went'; अम्लुचत् or अम्लोचीत् 'he went'; अग्रुचत् or अग्रोचीत् 'he stole'; अग्लुचत् or अग्लोचीत् 'he stole'; अग्लुञ्चत् or अग्लुञ्चीत् 'he went'; अश्वत्, भरवयीत, अश्वयीत् or अशिश्वियत् 'he grew'. The roots ग्लुच् and ग्लुञ्च् both give rise to the same three forms, viz. अग्लुचत्, अग्लुञ्चत् and अग्लञ्चोत्. The use of one root would, therefore, have served this purpose. The employment of both indicates separateness of their meanings. Others say that the use of both roots indicates that in the case of ग्लुञ्च, the nasal is never elided. Thus the Aorist of ग्लुञ्च will be अग्लुञ्चत् and अग्लुञ्चीत्.",
    "31059": "Thus अकरत् 'he did'; अमरत् 'he died'; अदरत् 'he tore'; आरुहत् 'he rose'. See <i>Rig Veda</i> (X. 85. 17), (X. 44. 6). The classical Aorist of these verbs are अकार्षीत्, अमृत, अदारीत् and अरुक्षत्.",
    "31060": "The affix त here means the third person singular tense-affix of the <i>Atmanepada</i>; as अपादि 'he went'; but not so in the dual and plural; as अपसाताम् 'they two went'; अपत्सत् 'they went'; अट् + पद + चिण् + त = अ + पाद् + त = अपादि (the affix त being elided by rule [[6.4.104]]).",
    "31061": "Thus अदीपि or अदीपिष्ट 'he shone'; अजनि or अजनिष्ट 'he was produced'; अबोधि or अबुद्ध 'he knew'; अपूरि or अपूरिष्ट 'he was full'; अतायि or अतायिष्ट 'he extended'; अप्यायि or अप्यायिष्ट 'he grew'.",
    "31062": "A reflective verb is one in which the object is spoken of as the agent. In reflective verbs therefore, चिण् is employed after roots ending in vowels; as अकारि कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat became made of itself. This is an optional rule (प्राप्तविभाषा). Therefore we have also अकृत कटः स्वयमेव; similarly अलावि or अलविष्ट केदारः स्वयमेव 'the embankment broke of itself.\n\nBut in verbs other than those that end in vowels, i.e. in those which end with a consonant, the चिण् is obligatory in the reflective voice, and not optional; as अभेदि काष्ठम् स्वयमेव 'the wood split of itself'. So also in verbs other than reflexives; as अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन.",
    "31063": "Thus अदोहि or अदुग्ध गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow milked of itself'. In verbs other than reflexive, the चिण् is compulsary, e.g. अदोहि गौर्गोपालकेन 'the cow was milked by the cowherd'.",
    "31064": "Thus अन्ववारुद्ध गौ स्वयमेव 'the cow was obstructed of itself'. In verbs other than reflexive, चिण् is employed, e. g. अन्ववारोधि गौर्गोपालकेन.",
    "31065": "This prohibition applies even to the passive and impersonal voices of the verb तप्; as अतप्त तपस्तापसः 'the ascetic performed austerity'; अन्वतप्त पापेन कर्मणा 'he repented from evil deeds'.",
    "31066": "A verb is said to denote an action when it is used impersonally; and it is said to denote an object when used in the Passive sense. As अशयि भवता 'it was lain by you i.e. you lay'; अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन; the mat was made by <i>Devadatta</i>'. The repetition of चिण् here is for the sake of distinctness.",
    "31067": "In forming Impersonal and Passive verbs, this affix is employed in the conjugational tenses. Thus in Impersonal verbs आस्यते भवता 'you sit', शय्यते भवता 'you lie'. So in passive verbs; as क्रियते कटः and गम्यते ग्रामः. The क of यक् is servile, and prevents <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i>. This affix is also used in reflective voice (कर्म्मकर्त्तरि); as क्रियते कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat becomes made of itself'.",
    "31068": "In active voice, शप् is employed in the conjugational tenses. This affix, which is technically called a विकरण comes after roots of the भू class and after compound roots formed by सन् &c. (III. I. 32). The indicatory श makes it a सार्वधातुक affix by (III. 4. II3), the प् indicates that the vowel has <i>anudatta</i> accent (III. I. 4). As भू + शप् + तिप् = भू + अ + ति = भो + अ + ति = भवति. [[7.3.84]]. So also पचति.",
    "31069": "This debars शप्. The servile न of श्यन् is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 197), showing that the <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the radical verb and not on the affix; and the indicatory श makes the affix <i>sarvadhatuka</i>; as दिव् + श्यन् + तिप् = दीव् + य + ति [[7.2.77]] = दीव्यति; so also सीव्यति. The <i>Divadi</i> verbs belong to the Fourth conjugation.",
    "31070": "Thus भ्राशते or भ्राश्यते 'he shines'; भ्लाशते or भ्लाश्यते 'he shines'; भ्रमति or भ्राम्यति 'he whirls'; क्रामति or क्राम्यति 'he walks'; क्लामति or क्लाम्यति 'he is sad'. So also त्रस्यति or त्रसति; त्रुट्यति or त्रुटति; लष्यति or लषति.",
    "31071": "Thus यास्यति or यसति 'he strives'. But no option is allowed in आयस्यति, प्रयस्यति. The root यस् belongs to the <i>Divadi</i> class.",
    "31072": "Thus संयस्यति or संयसति 'he strives'.",
    "31073": "This debars शप्. As सु + श्नु + तिप् = सु + नु + ति = सुनोति 'he presses out'. These are roots of the Fifth class.",

    "31077": "This debars शप्. The indicatory श makes this affix a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix. As तुद + श + ति = तुद + अ + ति = तुदति [[1.2.4]] 'he pains or torments'.",
    "31078": "This debars शप् The indicatory म् of the affix श्नम् shows that the affix न is to be placed after the last vowel of the root; see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.47]]. As रुध् + श्नम् + ति = रुध् + न + ति = रु + न + ध् + ति = रुणद्धि 'he obstructs'. So also भिनत्ति 'he splits'. The indicatory श is for the sake of <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.23]].",
    "31079": "This debars शप्. As तन् + उ + ति = तनोति 'he expands'; कृ + उ + ति = करोति 'he makes'. Though the root कृ is included in the list of the <i>Tanadi</i>verbs, for which see <i>Dhatupatha</i>, yet its separate enunciation in the present <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of making a restrictive rule with regard to this verb; that is to say, the root कृ is a <i>Tanadi</i>root only for the purposes of taking the affix उ; all the other operations of <i>Tanadi</i>verbs are not to be performed upon it. Thus the rule (II. 4.79.) does not apply to कृ. Thus अकृत and अकृत्याः; the सिच् elision being compulsory and not optional.",
    "31080": "The root धिन्व or धिन्वि belongs to the <i>Bhuadi</i> class. Thus धिन्व + उ + ति = धिन् + अ + उ + ति = धिन् + उ + ति [[6.4.48]] = धिनोति 'he pleases'. It might be asked, why there is no <i>guna</i> of the इ of धिन् by rule [[7.3.86]] which requires the base to be <i>gunated</i> before a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> or an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. The answer is to be found in <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.57]]; the substitute of अ which is a blank, is like the former occupant (<i>sthanivat</i>), and thus prevents <i>guna</i>.",
    "31081": "This debars शप्. As क्री + श्ना + तिप् = क्रीणाति 'he buys'. So also प्रीणाति 'he pleases'.",
    "31082": "As स्तभ्नाति or स्तभ्नोति, स्तुभ्नाति or स्तुभ्नोति, स्कभ्नाति or स्कभ्नोति, स्कुभ्नाति or स्कुभ्नोति, स्कुनाति or स्कुनोति. The first four of these roots are not found in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> and are to be found in the <i>sutras</i>, and hence called <i>Sautra</i> roots.",
    "31083": "The affix हि is the 2nd person singular of लोट् or the Imperative mood. Thus पुषाण 'do thou nourish', गृहाण 'do thou take', from roots पुष् and ग्रह which end with consonants. But we have क्रीणीहि 'do thou buy'; here there is no substitution of शानच्, because the root ends with a vowel. The repetition of श्ना in the <i>sutra</i> shows that शानच् is a mere substitute and not an independent affix.",
    "31084": "Thus गृभाय जिह्वया मधु, (<i>Rig Veda</i> VIII. I7. 5). The affix शानच् is also employed; as बधान पशून् 'kill the beasts'.",
    "31085": "The word व्यत्यय means transgression of the fixed rule, or interchange, taking of two <i>vikaraņas</i> at a time, and so on. Thus भेदति  = भिद + शप् + ति) instead of भिनत्ति from the root भिद 'to split', belonging to the <i>Rudhadi</i> class; e.g. शुष्मस्य आण्डानि भेदति (<i>Rig</i>. VIII. 40. II.) 'He (<i>Indra</i>) break the eggs (children) of <i>Shushma</i>; so also, जरसा मरते पतिः (<i>Rig</i>. X. 86. II); here there is मरते = (मृ + शप् + ते) instead of म्रियते; the root मृ belonging to the <i>Tudadi</i> class. So also there are two <i>vikaraņas</i> at one and the same time, in the following. इन्द्रो वस्ते न नेषतु 'May <i>Indra</i> lead by this abode' ; here there is नेषतु 3rd. per. sing. of the Imperative लोट् of the root नो 'to lead' ; there are two <i>vikaraņas</i> सिप् and शप् instead of नयतु = (नी +शप् + त्); इन्द्रेण युजा तरुषेम वृत्रम् (<i>Rig</i>.

I. 22) to (III. I. 86).",
    "31086": "This debars शप्. The affixes of the Benedictive are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> by [[3.4.116]]; but in the <i>Vedas</i> they are <i>sarvadhatuka</i> as well; see Rule [[3.4.117]]. The scope of the present rule is confined to the Benedictive of the verbs स्था, गा, गम्, वच्, वद्, शक् and रुह्; as उपस्थेयम्; सत्यमुपगेयम्; गमेम जानतो गृहान्, मन्त्र वोचेमाग्नये, विदेयमेनां मनसि प्रविष्ठां; व्रतम् चरिष्यामि तच्छकेयम्; स्वर्गं लोकमारुहेयम्.\n\nThe affix अक् is employed in the <i>Chhandas</i> after the verb दृश् in the Benedictive. Had there been अङ्, it would have caused <i>guna</i> by rule (VII. 4. 16.); to prevent this, अक् is ordained; as पितरञ्च दृशेयं मातरञ्च 'May I see the father and the mother'.",
    "31087": "This rule applies to reflexive verbs. \"This direction implies the substitution for the operations incident to a tense-affix or ल, denoting an agent, of all the operations, which fall to be performed when the tense-affix or ल denotes the object. Hence there shall be the affixing of यक् (III. I.67) the employment of <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations (I. 3. I3), the substitution of चिण् for च्लि (III. I. 66), and the treatment of the word as directed in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.62]].\" (Dr. Ballantyne). Thus भिद्यते काष्ठं स्वयमेव 'the wood splits of itself'; अभेदि काष्ठं स्वयमेव 'the wood splits of itself'.\n\nWhen an action is participated by or affects the agent in the same way as is done by the object, the agent is treated like an object.\n\nWhen in an object, though it stands as an agent, the action is perceived to take place as in an object, then that agent becomes like an object; and all grammatical rules applicable to the object apply to such an agent.\n\nThe word वत् 'like' in the <i>sutra</i> signifies that the rules which apply to an agent also come into operation; thus भिद्यते कुसूलेन.\n\nThe word कर्मणा 'with the object' in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the <i>tulyakriya</i> or similarity of action must be with the object, and not with the instrument or the location. Thus साध्वसिश्छिनत्ति 'the sword cuts well'; here 'sword' is not agent but instrument. So also साधु स्थाली पचति 'the pot cooks well'; here स्थाली is a location.\n\nThis '<i>karma-vad-bhava</i>, the passive-like-construction takes place only in cases of some verbs'.",
    "31088": "Thus तप्यते तपस्तापसः 'the devotee performs austere devotion'; but not so in उत्तपति सुवर्णं सुवर्णकारः 'the goldsmith heats the gold'.",
    "31089": "The affixes यक् and चिण् are used in forming the reflexive verbs, when the action affecting the agent is similar to the action which affects the object. With regard to the root दुह्, the affix यक् is only prohibited by the present <i>sutra</i>; the चिण् being optionally employed by rule (III. I. 63), as दुग्धे, अदुग्ध or अदोहि गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself', प्रस्नुते or प्रास्नीष्ट गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself'; नमते or अनंस्त दण्डः स्वयमेव 'the stick bends or bent of itself'.\n\nThis prohibition of the employment of the affixes यक् and चिण् is extended to the verbs that take the affix णि (such as causatives &c.), to the verbs श्रन्थ 'to loosen', मन्थ 'to compose' and ब्रू 'to speak', and to the <i>Atmanepadi</i>. Intransitive verbs. As कारयते 'it is caused to be made of itself; अचीकरत् 'it was caused to be made of itself; श्रथ्नीते 'it loosens of itself'; अश्रथ्निष्ट 'it loosened of itself'; मथ्नीते; अमथ्निष्ट 'it composes or composed of itself'; ब्रूते and अवोचत् 'it speaks and spoke of itself'; आहते and आवधिष्ट माणवकः स्वयमेव.",
    "31090": "This debars the affix यक् and the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations. As कुष्यति पादः स्वयमेव 'the foot draws up of itself'; रज्यति वस्त्रं स्वयमेव 'the cloth colours of itself'.\n\nThe phrase 'in the opinion of the Eastern' shows that it is an optional rule; so that we have also the forms कुष्यते and रज्यते.",
    "31091": "This is an <i>Adhikara</i> <i>Sutra</i>. All these verbal affixes are broadly divided into two parts कृत् and कृत्य् affixes, which will be described later on.",
    "31092": "Thus in <i>sutra</i> (III. 2.) कर्म्मण्यन् the word कर्म्मणि is exhibited in the 7th case; therefore the word implied by the word कर्म्मणि, namely, the word having the accusative case, will be called उपपद. Thus कुम्भम् + कृ + अण् = कुम्भकारः 'a potter'; here the word कुम्भम् is an <i>upapada</i>.",
    "31093": "Thus the affixes तव्यम् &c. are कृत्. All affixes up to the end of this Book belong to this class. These are affixes by which substantives are formed from verbal roots; and they have, therefore, most aptly been termed primary affixes. Words formed by these affixes will be <i>Pratipadikas</i> or crude forms or nominal bases [[1.2.46]]. Thus कृ + तव्यं = कर्तव्यं. Why do we say 'except तिङ् affixes'? Observe चीयात् 'may he collect', स्तुयात् 'may he praise' which form verbs and not nouns.",
    "31094": "Thus the affixes ण्वुल् and तृच् (III. I. I33) are general affixes applicable to all roots in forming nouns of agency; and the <i>sutra</i> (III. I. I33) which ordains these affixes, is an <i>utsarga</i> or a general rule; while the <i>sutra</i> (III. I. I35) ordaining the affix क्र after verbs having a penultimate इक् vowel, and the roots ज्ञा, प्री and कृ is an <i>apavada</i> or a special aphorism. In the latter case, therefore, optionally we may have the affixes ण्वुल् and तृच् also. Thus क्षिप् is a root that has a penultimate इ belonging to the <i>pratyahara</i> इक्; and therefore, in forming the noun of agency from it, the affix क will have to be applied by rule 135 of this chapter already mentioned; thus विक्षिप् + क = विक्षिप् + अ =विक्षिपः; but this special rule however does not debar the operation of the general rule, and we have optionally विक्षिप् + ण्वुल् =विक्षेपकः; an विक्षिप् + तृ =विक्षेप्तृ nom. sing. विक्षेप्ता.\n\nWhy do we say 'not being of the same form'? Because if two affixes have the same form, the present rule will not apply; and in the case of such affixes, the special affix will debar the general affix. Thus the affixes अण् and क are, when stripped of their indicatory letters, affixes having the same form i.e. अ; and therefore the <i>sutra</i> (III. 2. I.) ordaining अण् as a general rule, will be always debarred by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.3]] ordaining क, as the latter is a special <i>sutra</i> applicable only to those roots which end in long आ, or which are simple roots not compounded with any preposition. Thus गो + दा + क = गोदः 'giver of cows'. So also कम्बलदः 'blanket-giver'. In these cases we cannot have the affix अण्.\n\nIt follows from this <i>sutra</i> as a necessary corollary, that the addition of indicatory letters does not make two or more affixes dissimilar in form (असरूप) when their essential effective element is the same. Thus the affixes क, अण्, अच्, ण् &c. are similar.\n\nWhy do we say 'but not so in the case of feminine affixes'? Because in the case of feminine affixes, a special affix will debar a general affix, though they may be dissimilar in form. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.94]] ordaining क्तिन् in forming feminine nouns from roots is a general or <i>utsarga</i> rule, while <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.102]] ordaining अ after roots that have already taken some affix is a special or <i>apavada</i> rule, and though अ and ति are dissimilar in form, they being feminine affixes, the former will always debar the latter. Thus the compound desiderative roots चिकीर्ष and जिहीर्ष will form feminine nouns in आ and not by क्तिन्. Thus चिकीर्षा and जिहीर्षा and not चिकीर्षति &c.",
    "31095": "This defines the class of affixes known as <i>kritya</i>, a subdivision of <i>krit</i> affixes. These are certain affixes like तव्य, अनीय &c, which may be treated as declinable verbal terminations. [[3.4.70]]. The following 38 <i>sutras</i> treat of these affixes. These verbal adjectives correspond in meaning to the Latin participles in <i>udus</i> conveying the idea that the action expressed by the verbs ought to be done or will be done. The word formed by them may be called Passive Potential Participles or Future Passive Participles. The illustrations will be given hereafter under each affix as taught. The word <i>kritya</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> (II. I. 33), [[2.3.71]] &c.",
    "31096": "The phrase 'after verbal roots' is understood in this aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> 91. The final letters त् of तव्यत् and र् of अनीयर् are for the sake of indicating accent, being merely diacritical letters. The letter त् indicating <i>svarita</i> accent (VI. I. I85) and the letter र indicating penultimate <i>udatta</i> accent (VI. I. 217); these being exceptions to the general rule of accent given in <i>sutra</i> 3 <i>ante</i> of this chapter.\n\nThus कृ + तव्यत् = कर्तव्यम्, and कृ + तव्य = कर्तव्यम् 'must be done'; कृ + अनीयर् = करणीयम् 'must be done'. In these cases the sense being that of the action itself, there is neuter gender singular number.\n\nVart:- The affix तव्यत् when coming after the verb वस् 'to dwell' in marking the agent, is treated as if it had an indicatory ण. The force of ण् is to cause <i>vriddhi</i>. Thus वस् + तव्यत् =वास्तव्यः 'a dweller'. Here the word is in the masculine gender, as the force of the affix is that of the agent, and not as it generally has that of an act or object [[3.4.70]].\n\nVart:- The affix केलिमर् should be enumerated in addition to those already enumerated in this aphorism. Thus पचेलिमा माषाः 'kidney beans fit to be\ncooked'; भिदेलिमानि काष्ठानि 'the woods are apt to be split i. e: 'fragile'. This affix is to be employed when it is intended to express an object alone (i. e. in the passive and reflexive sense) and cannot be employed like those enumerated above, to denote also the action.",
    "31097": "The letter त् of this affix is indicatory showing that the <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the first vowel (VI. I. 213); thus गा + यत् = गेय, noun sing. गेयम् 'what is to be sung'; so also पेयम् 'what is to be drunk'; जेयम् 'what is to be conquered'. The आ of गा and पा is changed into ए by [[6.4.65]]. Why do we say 'that ends in a vowel'? By <i>sutra</i> 124 of this chapter, a root ending in a consonant takes ण्यत् affix instead of यत्; reading these two aphorisms together, the conclusion to be drawn is that the affix यत् comes after roots which primarily end in a vowel, though in the course of development they may end in a consonant by the application of other rules. Thus from दो 'to cut', we have the desiderative root दित्स, which ends in a vowel अ. This अ is elided before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes and thus the root becomes दित्स्, which ends in a consonant; nevertheless we shall have the affix यत् and not ण्यत्. Thus दित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be cut'; धित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be placed'. Similarly लु before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes becomes लो, the ओ is changed into अव् before य (VI. I. 79) and the form then is लव्. The root लव् however takes यत् and not ण्यत्; as लव्यो, पव्यम्, &c.\n\nVart:- The verbs तक् 'to fly', शच् 'to leap', चत् 'to ask', यत् 'to attempt' and जन् 'to be born', should be enumerated in addition; that is to say, these verbs, though ending in a consonant, take यत् and not ण्यत्; as तक्यम्, शस्यम्, चत्यम्, यत्यम्, and जन्यम्.\n\nVart:-Ånd of the verb हन् 'to kill' वध is the substitute when it optionally takes the affix यत्. Thus we have वध्यम् or घात्यम्. The latter form is evolved by <i>sutras</i> (VII. 3. 32 and 54). The affix यत् comes only after the वध् substitute; after हन् the affix ण्यत् comes which changes the ह into घ, and न into त and causes <i>vriddhi</i>.",
    "31098": "This debars ण्यत्; thus शप् + यत् =शप्यं 'to be sworn'; लभ् + यत् = लभ्यम् 'to be acquired'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which ends in a labial'? Because if a root ends in any other consonant, though preceded by a short अ, the root will take ण्यत्; thus पच् + ण्यत् = पाक्यम् 'what is to be cooked'; वाक्यम् 'speech'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when preceded by a short अ'? When preceded by any other vowel, it will take ण्यत्; thus कुप् + ण्यत् = कोप्यम् 'to be angry'; so also गोप्यम् 'to be concealed'.\n\nThe word अत् is used in the <i>sutra</i> in the original. The force of त् here is, by (I. I. 70), that short अ having one <i>matra</i> or prosodial length is to be taken and not long आ. Therefore, after the root आप् 'to obtain', we have ण्यत् and not यत्; thus आप्यम् 'to be reached' i. e. 'attainable'.",
    "31099": "Thus शक्यम् 'possible'; सह्यम् 'endurable'.",
    "31100": "Thus गद्यम् 'what is to be spoken, i.e prose'; मद्यम् 'wine'; चर्यम् 'what is to be followed'; यम्यम् 'what is to be restrained'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not preceded by a preposition'? When compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>, these roots will take ण्यत्; thus प्रगाद्यम्; प्रमाद्यम् &c.\n\nThe root यम् would have taken the affix यत् by <i>sutra</i> 98 also, as it ends in म and is preceded by अ; its separate enumeration in this <i>sutra</i> is in order to show, that the compound verb यम् will not take the affix यत्. Therefore with regard to यम्, this is a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule and not a <i>vidhi</i> or original rule.\n\nVart:- The root चर when preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the यत्, affix when the sense is not that of a preceptor; thus आचर्यो देशः 'an approachable or communicable country'. But when the sense is that of a teacher the root takes ण्यत्; thus आचार्यः 'a preceptor'",
    "31101": "Thus, अवद्यं पापं 'censurable sin'. Another and regular form is अनुद्यम्. This is formed by adding the affix क्यप् to the root वद् by (III. I. 106). So also पण्यः कम्बलः 'saleable blanket'; पण्याः गौः 'saleable cow'. The other and regular form is पाण्यम्, formed by the addition of ण्यत्. So also शतेन वर्या 'unobstructed by hundred'; सहस्रेण वर्या 'unobstructed by thousand'. The other and regular form is वृत्या from the root वृ 'to choose'. वर्या means a girl choosing her own husband and is non-obstructable by any body. The word वर्या in the <i>sutra</i> is in the feminine gender, and it is in this gender only that the word is so formed. In the masculine gender, the word is regularly formed; thus वार्या ऋत्विजः.",
    "31102": "The word वह्य is derived from root वह 'to carry' and means 'a vehicle', i. e., that by which a thing is carried; as वह्यं शकटम्. When it does not mean a carriage, the root takes the affix ण्यत्; thus वाह्यः 'an ox'.",
    "31103": "The word अर्य is irregularly formed when meaning 'lord' and a '<i>Vaisya</i>'.\nThe root ऋ 'to go', would have taken ण्यत् by <i>sutra</i> 124 of this chapter; but it takes यत् when the sense of the word formed by it is that of a 'lord' or a man of '<i>Vaisya</i>' caste. As अर्यः स्वामी, 'honored lord', अर्ये वैश्यः 'honored <i>Vaisya</i>'.\n\nVart: Though by (VI. I. 213), the affix यत् makes the <i>udatta</i> accent fall on the first syllable of the word, yet in the case of the word अर्य, when it means 'lord', the accent falls on the last syllable.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it means a lord or a <i>Vaisya</i>'? Otherwise the root takes the affix ण्यत्; as आर्यो ब्राह्मणः 'the respectable <i>Brahmana</i>'.",
    "31104": "The word उपसर्या is formed by adding यत् affix to the root सृ 'to move', compounded with the preposition उप. The word काल्या means having reached the time. The word प्रजन means the first conception. Thus उपसर्या गौः 'the cow fit for the bull'; उपसर्या वडवा 'the mare fit for the horse'. \nWhy do we say 'when meaning what has reached the time favorable to conception'? Otherwise the affix ण्यत् will be used; as उपसर्या शरदि मधुरा '<i>Madhura</i> is approachable in <i>Sarat</i> season'.",
    "31105": "The word अजर्यम् is formed from the root जृ by the addition of यत्, and affixing the negative particle अ; as अ + जृ + यत् = अजर्यं.\n\nThus अजर्यं नोऽस्तु सङ्गतम् 'let our friendship be imperishable'. So also अजर्यमार्यसङ्गतम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when qualifying the word सङ्गतम्'? Observe अजरिता कम्बलः 'undecaying blanket'.",
    "31106": "The phrase 'not having a preposition' is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i>100 <i>ante</i>. The force of the word 'also' is to indicate that the affix यत् is also employed. The word सुपि means 'in construction with an <i>upapada</i> that ends in case-affix'.\n\nThus ब्रह्म + वद् + क्यप् = ब्रह्म + वद् + य = ब्रह्मोद्य; ब्रह्म + वद् + यत् = ब्रह्मवद्यम् 'told by the <i>Vedas</i> or <i>Brahman</i>'. Similarly सत्योद्यम् or सत्यवद्यम् 'truth-mouthed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it has a case-inflected word as <i>upapada</i>'? Otherwise वद् + ण्यत् = वाद्यम् 'a musical instrument'.\n\nWhy do we say 'not having a preposition'? Observe प्रवाद्यम् ' a rumour' formed by the affix ण्यत् and not by यत् or क्यप्.",
    "31107": "The words सुपि and अनुपसर्गे of previous <i>sutras</i> are understood in this. The <i>anuvritti</i> of यत् does not cover this aphorism. As ब्रह्मभुवं गतः = ब्रह्मत्वं गतः 'gone to or arrived at <i>Brahma</i>hood'; देवभुवं = देवत्वं गतः 'gone to divinity'.\n\nThe word <i>bhava</i> of this <i>sutra</i> governs the succeeding ones.\n\nWhy do we say 'in construction with a case-inflected word'? Otherwise it will take यत्; as भू + यत् = भो + यत् = भव्यम् (VI. I.79).\n\nWhy do we say 'not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रभव्यम् ।",
    "31108": "The phrases सुपि अनुपसर्गे and भावे are understood in this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nAs ब्रह्म + हन् + क्यप् = ब्रह्म + हत् + य = ब्रह्महत्य, (VI. I. 71) ब्रह्महत्या '<i>Brahman</i>- murder'. So also अश्वहत्या 'killing a horse'.\n\nWhen not in construction with a noun, the form is घातः 'a blow' (हन् + णिच् +घञ्). This verb does not take the affix ण्यत् in denoting condition, there being no example of such formation.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रघातो वर्तते 'there is a combat'.",
    "31109": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of सुपि, अनुपसर्गे and भावे does not extend to this aphorism. The present <i>sutra</i> ordains generally the affix व्यप् after the above verbs. Thus इ + क्यप् = इ + त + य (VI. I. 71) = इत्यः 'to be gone'. The letter त being added by Rule (VI. I. 71) which declares 'त is the augment of a short vowel when a कृत् affix, with an indicatory प् follows'. So also स्तु + क्यप् = स्तुत्यः 'to be praised'; शास् + क्यप् = शिस् + य (आ being changed into इ by [[6.4.34]]) = शिष्यः 'to be instructed i.e. a pupil'. So also वृ + क्यप् = वृत्यः 'to be chosen'; आदृ + क्यप् = आदृत्यः 'to be honoured'; जुष् + क्यप् = जुष्यः 'to be served'.\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of क्यप् was coming from the previous <i>sutra</i> 100, its repetition in this aphorism is to indicate that other rules such as 125 of this chapter should not take effect in the above verbs. Thus Rule 125 requires ण्यत् 'after the verb स्तु, but the present rule prohibits that. Thus we have अवश्य स्तुत्यः 'must be praised'.\n\nBy वृ in the <i>sutra</i> the root वृञ् is intended to be taken, and not the root वृङ्. The equivalent derivative of the latter is वार्यः as वार्या ऋत्विजः.\n\nVart:- The roots शस् 'to praise' दुह् 'to milk' and गुह् 'to cover' optionally take the affix क्यप्. As शस्यम् or शंस्यम् [[6.4.37]]; दुह्यम् or दोह्यम्, गुह्यम् or गोह्यम्.\n\nVart:- The verb अञ्ज् 'to anoint', preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the affix क्यप् when used as an appellative. As आ + अञ्ज् + क्यप् = आज्यम् meaning clarified butter. The nasal is elided by [[6.4.24]].\n\nObj.- How do you explain the form उपेयम् which is evidently formed from the root इ by adding यत् ? According to the present <i>sutra</i>, the affix\nक्यप् ought to have been added. Ans. The इ in उपेयम् is a different root from that taken here. The root in this <i>sutra</i> is इण् of the <i>Adadi</i> class.",
    "31110": "Thus वृत् + क्यप् = वृत्यम्; so also वृध्यम्. But क्लृप् and चृत् will form कल्प्यम्, and चर्त्यम्.\n\nWhy have we used the letter त् in ऋत् ? It is to indicate that short ऋ\nis meant and not long ॠ (I. I. 70). Therefore the root कॄत् will take ण्यत् and form कीर्त्यम्.\n\nVart:- The root सृज् takes the affix ण्यत् when compounded with the word पाणि. Thus पाणिसर्ग्या रज्जुः 'a rope'.\n\nVart:- The root सृज् when preceded by both सम् and अव takes ण्यत् as समवसर्ग्या.",
    "31111": "Thus खन् + क्यप् = ख + ई + य = खेयम् 'to be dug'. The long ई is used in the <i>sutra</i> for the sake of euphony. The same purpose would have been served by using short इ, thus 'इ च खनः'. But the long ई indicates that the rule [[6.4.43]] does not apply here. By that rule the अ of खन् would have been lengthened into आ before the affix क्यप्.",
    "31112": "Thus भृ + क्यप् = भृत्य Pl. भृत्याः 'those who ought to be supported' i. e. 'servants'. Why do we say 'when not used as an appellative'? Observe क्षृ + ण्यत् = क्षार्थः 'a <i>Kshatriya</i>'.\n\nVart:- The use of <i>kyap</i> is optional when this verb takes the preposition सम्. Thus सम्भृत्याः or सम्भार्याः.",
    "31113": "This is an example of <i>Prapta-vibhasha</i>. By rule 110 ante, the root मृज् having a penultimate ऋ would have necessarily taken <i>kyap</i>; this <i>sutra</i> declares an option. As परिमृज्यः or परिमार्ग्यः 'to be cleansed'. The second form is thus evolved:-\n\nपरिमृज्य + ण्यत् (III. I. 124) = परिमृग् + य [[7.3.52]] = परिमार्ग्य [[7.2.114]]",
    "31114": "Thus राज्ञा सोतव्यः or राज्ञा इह सूयते, राज + सू + क्यप् = राजसूयः 'the <i>Rajasuya</i> or coronation sacrifice'.\n\nSimilarly सृ or सू + क्यप् = सूर्यः 'the sun', literally that which moves (सरति) in the sky; or that which impels (सुवति) creation to action. मृष +वद +क्यप् = मृषोद्यम् 'false speech'; this is an exception to rule 106, by which यत् would also have been applied This rule prevents it. Thus रोचतेऽसौ, रुच् + क्यप् = रुच्य. 'an agreeable lover'. So also गुप् + क्यप् = कुप्यम् 'a base metal (other than gold and silver)'; the other form is गोप्यम् । कृष्ट + पच् = कृष्टपच्याः 'that which ripens of itself in cultivated ground'. न व्यथते = अव्यथ्यः 'a snake (what does not move by legs)'.",
    "31115": "Thus भिद् + क्यप् = भिद्यः 'a river that breaks its banks by the rush of its water', the name of the <i>Bhidya</i> river.\n\nऊज्झ् + क्यप् = उद्ध्य 'a river whose waters overflow the banks', name of the <i>Uddhya</i> river; the झ is changed into ध.\n\nWhen not meaning or qualifying the river, the regular forms are used; thus भेत्ता and उज्झिता.",
    "31116": "Thus पुष् + क्यप् = पुष्यः 'the <i>Pushya</i> asterism'. It is so called because objects are nourished under the influences of this asterism. सिध् + क्यप् = सिद्ध्यः 'the asterism <i>Siddhya</i>' another name of <i>Pushya</i>, so-called because things are accomplished under the influence of this star.\n\nWhen not the names of asterisms, the forms are पोषणं 'nourishing', सेधनम् 'accomplishing'.",
    "31117": "Thus वि + पू + क्यप् = विपूयः etymologically 'that which has to be purified to make rope'; वि + नी + क्यप् =विनीय 'a sediment or sin'; जि + क्यप् = जित्य 'a plough that which is to be conquered by strength'.\n\nThe regular derivatives are विपाव्यम्, विनेयम् and जेयम्.",
    "31118": "Thus मत्तस्य न प्रतिग्राह्यम् तस्मान्नापिगृह्यम् ॥\n\nIn the classical Sanskrit the proper forms are प्रतिगृह्यम् and अपिग्राह्यम्.",
    "31119": "Thus प्रगृह्यम् 'the <i>Pragrihya</i> words that do not admit of <i>sandhi</i>, already defined in <i>sutra</i> (I. I. II). So also अवगृह्यं.\n\nThe word अस्वैरि means dependent upon others, not free to provide for himself. Thus गृह्यकाः शुकाः 'the captive parrots'.\n\nThe word बाह्य means 'situated outside'. Thus ग्रामगृह्या सेना 'an army lying outside the village'. The word बाह्या being in the feminine gender indicates that the derivative word formed from ग्रह must also be feminine in gender to have this sense.\n\nThe word पक्ष्य is derived from पक्ष 'a side, a party', and means a partisan, follower or friend. Thus वासुदेवगृह्याः 'siding with or being the partisans of <i>Vasudeva</i>'. So also अर्जुनगृह्याः 'belonging to the party of <i>Arjun</i>'.",
    "31120": "The root कृ would have taken the affix ण्यत्, by 124, and the verb वृष् would necessarily have taken क्यप् by 110; the present <i>sutra</i> therefore declares an optional rule. Thus: कृ + क्यप् = कृत्यम् 'to be done'; or कृ + ण्यत् = कार्यम्. So also वृष्यम् or वर्ष्यम् 'stimulating'.",
    "31121": "The word पत्र means that by which a thing is carried. Thus युग्यो गौ 'the carrier bull or the yoked bull'. युग्यो हस्ती 'the harnessed elephant ready to carry'. युज् + क्यप् = युग्यम्. The ज is changed into ग. When not meaning a carrier or a carriage, it has the form योग्यं.",
    "31122": "The word अमा means 'along' or 'together'. अमा in composition with the root वस् 'to dwell', takes the affix ण्यत् in the sense of location of time. Optionally the <i>Vriddhi</i> is not substituted in such a case. The time or the day on which the sun and the moon dwell together in the same constellation is called अमावास्या or अमावस्या.\n\nThe final त in अमावस्यत् is indicatory and is for the sake of showing where should the proper accent fall.\n\nThe two forms अमावस्या or अमावास्या are the same word, and a fortiori a rule made with regard to one will be made applicable to the other. And to this effect there is a <i>paribhasha</i> which declares एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वम् ; 'that which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place'. Therefore <i>sutra</i>[[4.3.30]], though it, in terms, says अमावास्याया वा is made applicable to the form अमावस्या also.",
    "31123": "The formation of the above words are extremely irregular and they are all met with in the Vedic literature only. Thus the word निष्टर्क्य is derived from the root कृत् 'to cut', with the preposition निस्, and the affix ण्यत्, instead of क्यप् which is the regular affix, by 110; निः + कृत् + ण्वत् = निः + तृक् + य (the root कृत् transformed into तृक् by transposition) = निष्टर्क्य. As निष्टर्क्ये चिन्वीत् पशुकामः.\n\nThe above is apparently a guess-work etymology of grammarians.\n\nSo also देवहूय is formed by adding to the root हूयते 'to call' or हू 'to invoke', the affix क्यप् and the <i>upapada</i> देव; the vowel of the root is then lengthened and the augment त (VI. I.71), is not allowed, देव + है or हू + क्यप् = देवहूयः So also प्र + नी (to lead) + क्यप् = प्रणीयः; उत् + नी + क्यप् = उन्नीयः, उत् + शिष् (to leave) + क्यप् = उच्छिष्यम्; मृ (to die) + यत् = मर्यः; स्तृ (to cover) + यत् = स्तर्या; it is always feminine. ध्वृ (to bend) + यत् = ध्वर्यः; खन् (to dig) + यत् = खन्यः; खन् + ण्यत् = खान्यः; देव (God) + यज् (to sacrifice) + यत् = देवयज्या; always used as feminine. आ + पृच्छ् (to ask) + क्यप् = आपृच्छ्यः, प्रति + सीव (to sew) + क्यप् = प्रतिषीव्यः; ब्रह्मण् + वद् (to speak) + ण्यत् = ब्रह्मवाद्यः; भू (to be) + ण्यत् = भाव्यः; स्तु (to praise) + ण्यत् = स्ताव्यः; उप + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् + पृडं = उपचाय्यपृडम्. This last word is formed then only when the word पृड follows: and when the sense is that of 'gold'. When it does not mean 'gold', the form is उपचेयपृडम् ।",
    "31124": "The phrase ॠहलोः is in the genitive case dual number, the force of genitive here being that of ablative. As कृ + ण्यत् = कार्यम् 'to be made'; हृ + ण्यत् = हार्य nom. sing. हार्यम् 'to be taken'; धृ + ण्यत् = धार्यं; 'to be held'; वच् + ण्यत् = वक् + ण्यत् [[7.3.52]] = वाक्यं (VII. 2. II6) 'to be spoken'; पच् + ण्यत् = पाक्यम्.",
    "31125": "This debars the affix यत्. Thus लु + ण्यत् = लौ + य = लाव्यं [[7.2.115]] and (VI. I. 79) 'must be cut'; so also पु + ण्यत् = पाव्यम् 'must be purified'.\n\nWhen 'necessity' is not indicated we have the form लव्यं 'to be cut' The <i>sutra</i> as given in the original is rather ambiguous; it may be construed to mean, 1st when the word आवश्यक or a word having the sense of this term is in construction as <i>upapada</i>, the affix ण्यत् is employed : or 2ndly when, the sense of the affix is that of 'necessity', the ण्यत् is employed. There are objections to both these interpretations taken separately. For in the first case, though we could form the words अवश्यलाव्यं &c., we could not form the word लाव्य by itself. In the second case, though we could form the single word लाव्यं, we could not form the compound. The best solution is to take the second interpretation and form the compound by the universal rule of <i>Tatpurusha</i> contained in (II. I. 72), which would also regulate the accent.",
    "31126": "The verb आसु is a compound verb formed by the preposition आङ् and the root सु. This <i>sutra</i> debars यत् that would otherwise have come by <i>sutra</i> 97 and 98.\n\nThus आसु + ण्यत् = आसाव्यम्, (VII. 2. II5) and (VI. I. 79); so also याव्यम्, वाप्यम्, राप्यम्, लाप्यम्, त्राप्यम् and आचाम्यम्.\n\nThe force of the word च 'and' in the <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that the roots not included in the above enumeration should also be taken. Thus दभ् + ण्यत् = दाभ्यम् ॥",
    "31127": "This word is thus formed:- आङ् + नी + ण्यत् = आ + नै + य = आनाय्य, (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79)).\n\nAs आनाय्यो दक्षिणाग्निः. This is a species of <i>Dakshiņagni</i> fire. As this fire is brought from the <i>Garhapatya</i> fire and is not permanently kept alive, therefore it is called <i>anayya</i>. This however, is not co-extensive with <i>Dakshiņagni</i>. It is that fire which is brought from the <i>Garhapatya</i>, and has the same source with the <i>Dakshiņagni</i> and <i>Ahavaniyagni</i>. A <i>Dakshinagni</i> fire may be taken from different sources, as from the family of a well-to-do <i>Vaishya</i>, or from a frying place, or from <i>Garhapatya</i> fire. When it is taken from the last i. e. from <i>Garhapatya</i> fire, it is <i>anayya</i> <i>Dakshiņagni</i>. <i>Ahavaniya</i> is also taken from <i>Garhapatya</i>.\n\nIt is not everything, that is not lasting, which is called <i>anayya</i> ; for a fragile pot will not be called so. It applies only to the consecrated fire. When it has not this sense, the form is आनेय meaning 'what ought to be brought'.",
    "31128": "The word असम्मति is a negative word meaning 'non-agreement'. It means also 'disrespect'.\n\nThus प्रणाय्यश्चोरः 'the thief is to be disliked'.\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'disapproved'. Because otherwise the regular form is प्र + नी 'to lead' + यत् = प्रणेयः 'tractable'.\n\nThe word in the <i>sutra</i> is असम्मति which we have translated as 'disapproved'. But the word सम्मति also means अभिलाष or 'desire'; and असम्मति would therefore, mean 'free from desire or worldly attachment'. Therefore the word असम्मति means also 'free from attachment', as in the following sentence:-\n\nज्येष्ठाय पुत्राय पिता ब्रह्म प्रभ्रूयात्, प्रणाय्याय अन्तेवासिने नान्यस्मै कस्मैचन  'let the father teach the Secret Doctrine to his eldest son, or to such pupil who is free from worldly attachment, and to no one else'.",
    "31129": "These words are supposed to be formed thus:- मा (to measure) + ण्यत् = पाय्यम्, the म being changed into प and another य being added by [[7.3.33]]. The regular form is मेयम् 'to be measured' (मा + ण्यत् = मे + य [[6.4.65]] = मेय). सम् + नी (to lead) + ण्यत् = सान्नाय्यम् 'the oblation'. It being a crude form applies to a particular kind of oblation. The regular form is सन्नेयम् । नि + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = नि + चै + य = नि + चाय + य = निकाय्यः 'a dwelling'. The regular form is निचेय । धा (to put) + ण्यत् = धाय्या (fem.). The <i>samadheni</i> is the name of certain <i>Rik</i> hymns used as supplemental verses in a Litany. The other form is धेय ।",
    "31130": "These words are thus formed: कुण्ड + पा (to drink) + यत् = कुण्ड + पा + य + य [[7.3.33]] = कुण्डपाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which <i>Soma</i> is drunk with a bowl'. The accent falls on the first syllable by (VI. I. 213). सम् + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = सञ्चाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which <i>Soma</i> is collected'.\n\nIf not applied to sacrifices, the forms will be कुण्डपानम् and सञ्चेयः.",
    "31131": "These words are thus formed:- परि + चि +ण्यत् = परि + चै + य = परि + चाय + य = परिचाय्यः 'sacrificial fire arranged in a circle' (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79). This peculiar sandhi before the semivowel य has been illustrated in the previous examples also). So also उपचाय्यः 'a kind of Sacred fire'. सम् + वह + ण्यत् = सम् + ऊह् + य = समूह्यः 'a kind of fire'. समूह्यं चिन्वीत पशुकामः 'let him kindle the <i>Samuhya</i> fire desirous of a victim'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when they are names of fire'? Observe otherwise, परिचेयम् 'to be heaped', उपचेयम् 'to be increased', संवाह्यम् 'to be carried'.",
    "31132": "The word चित्यः comes from the root चि 'to collect', and means fire i. e. that which is collected. As चित्योऽग्निः 'the funeral pile fire'. The word अग्निचित्या means, arranging the fire. The affix य has been added to denote condition, together with the augment तुक् (त्). These words have <i>udatta</i> accent on the last vowel. The regular form is चेयम् 'to be gathered'.",
    "31133": "The word 'root' is understood in the above aphorism. Thus कृ 'to do' + ण्वुल्  = कार + यु (VII. 2. II5) = कार + अक (VII. I. I) = कारक nom. sing. कारकः 'doer.' कृ + तृच् = कर् + तृ [[7.3.84]] = कर्तृ nom. sing. कर्ता. So also हारकः and हर्ता.\n\nThe च् of तृच् is not indicatory, but distinguishes this affix from तृन्; the simple तृ includes both तृच् and तृन्, as in [[5.3.59]], and (VI. 4. I54).",
    "31134": "The word <i>adi</i> meaning etcetra, is to be joined with every one of the above three words. These three affixes come respectively after the verbs of the above three classes. Thus after the verbs of नन्द class, comes the affix ल्यु; after the verbs of ग्रह class, comes the affix णिनि; after the verbs of पच् class, comes the affix अच्.\n\nThe नन्दादि verbs will not be found in one place in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>. The list of the words formed by these affixes have, however, been collected in the <i>Ganapatha</i>. Thus नन्द् + ल्यु = नन्द् + यु (I 3. 8) = नन्द् + अन (VI. I. I) = नन्दन nom. sing. नन्दनः 'son' (lit. what gladdens). So also from the following causative roots, nouns are formed, meaning names :- वासि - वासनः or वाशनः; मदि - मदनः; दूषि - दूषणः (or भूषणः); साधि - साधनः; वर्धि - वर्धनः; शोभि - शोभनः and रोचि - रोचनः.\n\nThe following derivatives are names :- सहि - सहनः; तपि - तपनः; दमि — दमनः\n\nSo also the following words :- जल्पनः, रमणः, दर्पणः, सङ्क्रन्दनः, सङ्कर्षणः, संहर्षणः, जनार्दनः, यवनः, पवनः, मधुसूदनः, विभीषणः, लवणः (the ण in लवण is irregular), चित्तविनाशनः, कुलदमनः and शत्रुदमनः.\n\nThe ग्रहादि verbs are also nowhere enumerated in a group. The following are, however, those verbs :- ग्रह् - ग्रहिन् nom. ग्राही; उत्सह - उत्साहिन् nom. उत्साही; उद्दस् - उद्दासिन्; उद्भास् - उद्भासिन्; स्था - स्थायिन्; मन्त्र - मन्त्रिन्; सम्मर्द — सम्मर्दिन्. So also the verbs - रक्ष, श्रु, वस्, वप् and शा preceded by नि; as, निरक्षिन्, निश्राविन्, निवासिन्, निवापिन्, निशायिन्. The verbs याचि, व्याहृ, संव्याहृ, व्रज, वद and वस take णिन् when preceded by the negative particle; as, अयाचिन्, अव्याहारिन्, असंव्याहारिन्, अव्राजिन्, अवादिन् and अवासिन्. So also after verbs ending in a vowel when agents are non-conscious beings : as, अकारिन्, अहारिन्. So also, अविनायिन्, अविशायिन्, विशयिन्, विषयिन् (meaning a place) विशायिन् and विषायिन्, अभिभाविन् अपराधिम्, उपरोधिन्, परिभविन् and परिभाविन् ।\n\nThe following are पचादि words :- पच, वच, वप, वद, चल, तप, पत नदट्, भषट्, वस् गरत् प्लवट्, तरट्, चीरट्, माहट्, जर, मर, क्षर, क्षम, सूदट्, देवट्, मोरट् सेव, मेष, क्रोध, व्रण, दंश, दश, दम्भ, जारभर, श्वपच, मेघ, कीष, क्षप, मद, रज, दीषट्, चरट् ।\n\nThe ट् in नदट् &c., shows that the feminine of these is formed by long ई (IV. I. 15). The पचादि class is an आकृतिगणः ।\n\nअज्विधिः सर्वधातुभ्यः पठ्यन्ते च पचादयः ।\nअण् बाधनार्थमेवं स्यात् सिध्यन्ति श्वपचादयः ॥\n\nIn fact the affix अच् comes after all verbs, and is not exclusively confined to the verbs above enumerated. The affix अव्, therefore, debars अण् and may be taken to be the universal affix, and by its help the forms like\nश्वपच &c. may be explained.",
    "31135": "Thus विक्षिप् + क = विक्षिप nom. sing. विक्षिपः. So also विलिखः 'inscription'; बुधः 'who knows', कृशः 'lean'; ज्ञा + क = ज्ञः 'who knows' [[6.4.64]]; प्री + क = प्रियः 'what pleases'; कॄ + क = कि + अ ( VII. I. 100) = किर् + अ (I. I. 51) = किरः 'who scatters' i. e. 'a hog'.\n\nThe words देव 'God', सेव 'service' and मेष 'ram', should be read in the पचादि class of the last <i>sutra</i>, being formed by the affix अच् and not by क.",
    "31136": "This is an <i>apavada</i> of  (III. I. 40), and debars the affix ण. Thus प्रस्था + क = प्रस्थ + अ = प्रस्थः [[6.4.64]]. सुग्लै + क = सुग्ल + अ = सुग्लः 'very weary' (आ substituted for ऐ by (VI. I. 45.)) सुम्लै + क = सुम्ला + अ = सुम्लः 'very languid'.\n\nThe final आ is dropped before the affix क by rule [[6.4.64]]. There is elision of long आ when an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows beginning with a vowel and having an indicatory क or ङ.",
    "31137": "Thus उत् + पा + शा = उत् + पिब् + अ [[7.3.78]] = उत्पिब nom. sing. उत्पिबः; so also विपिबः; उज्जिघ्रः and विजिघ्रः । उत् + ध्मा + श = उत् + धम्+ अ = [[7.3.78]]; उद्धमः; विधमः; उत् + धे + श = उद्धयः; विधयः; so also उत् + दृश् + शा = उत्पश्यः, [[7.3.78]]. so also विपश्यः;\n\nSome commentators do not read the word '<i>upasarga</i>' into this <i>sutra</i>. According to them the forms like पश्यः &c., can be formed also.\n\nThe affix श, of which श् is indicatory, the real affix being अ, causes the root to undergo all those changes, which it undergoes in special tenses; for it is a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix there; see <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.113]] and [[7.3.78]].\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the root घ्रा, when the word to be formed is a name. As वि + आ + घ्रा + क = व्याघ्रः 'tiger' (an animal that goes about smelling). Here there is क and not the affix श.",
    "31138": "Thus लिम्पः 'smearing'; विन्दः 'acquiring'; धारयः 'holding' पारयः 'ferrying; वेदयः 'knowing'; उपेजयः 'shaking'; चेतयः 'perceiving'; सातयः, and साहयः.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used without a preposition'? Observe प्रलिपः; here the affix is क.\n\nVart:- The verb लिप् with the preposition नि takes the affix श. As निलिम्पा 'the name of certain deities', 'a cow'.\n\nVart:- The affix श is employed after विन्द when compounded with the words गो &c. and when the word to be formed is a proper noun. As गोविन्दः '<i>Krishna</i>' (protector of cows); अरविन्दः 'a lotus' (having petals like spokes).",
    "31139": "This debars ण. Thus ददः 'giving'; or दायः 'inheritance'; दधः 'holding' or धायः 'having'.\n\nWhen a preposition is used, the affix श is not employed; as प्रदः, प्रधः.",
    "31140": "The word इति in ज्वलति indicates beginning. These are about 56 verbs, all belonging to the <i>Bhvadi</i> class. See No. 804 to 860 in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, Bombay Edition in the Appendix to <i>Sidhanta Kaumudi</i>.\n\nThis debars the affix अच्; as ज्वालः or ज्वलः; चालः or चलः.\n\nThe affix ण (अ) having an indicatory ण्, causes the <i>vriddhi</i> of the penultimate अ. When the affix ण is not used, then अच् is used and we have the other form. But compound verbs take अच्; as प्रज्वलः 'luminous'.\n\nVart:- The verb तन 'to stretch' must be included in this list, and it takes the affix ण; as अवतान. The conditions 'option' and 'without preposition' do not apply in this case. The verb तन् necessarily takes this affix, though compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>.",
    "31141": "The root श्यै, before affixes, becomes श्या, (VI. I. 45) and is thus included in the phrase 'verbs ending in long आ'. What is then the use of its separate enumeration? The separate enumeration is for the sake of excluding the application of every other rule which might have prohibited ण. Thus (III. I. 136) enjoins क when a compound verb ends in अ. But that rule does not apply to the verb श्या.\n\nThus अवश्यायः 'frost', प्रतिश्यायः 'catarrh', दायः 'inheritance', धायः 'having', व्याधः 'pain', आस्रावः 'wound', संस्रावः 'flow', अत्यायः 'transgression', अवसायः 'conclusion', अवहारः 'taken away', लेहः 'licking', श्लेषः 'embracing', श्वासः 'breath'. See [[7.3.33]].",
    "31142": "Thus दु + ण = दौ + अ [[7.2.115]] = दावः [[6.1.78]] 'burning'. So also नी + ण = नी + अ = नायः 'leading'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used without a preposition'? Observe प्रदयः 'burning'; प्रणयः 'friendship'.",
    "31143": "This debars the affix अच्. Thus ग्रह् + ण = ग्रह् + अ [[7.2.116]] = ग्राहः 'seizing', 'a crocodile'; or ग्रह + अच् =ग्रहः 'a planet'.\n\nThe option allowed by this aphorism is a <i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i> or definite option, that is to say, the affix ण is always used when the word to be formed means a water-animal, such as a crocodile, shark &c., and in that sense the word is ग्राह. But not so, when heavenly luminaries are meant; there the word is ग्रह.\n\nVart:- This rule should be extended to the root भू 'to be' also. Thus:- भावः 'condition' and भवः 'existence'.",
    "31144": "Thus ग्रह + क (VI. I. 16) = गृहम् 'a house'. The र is changed into ॠ by the rule of <i>samprasarana</i>. The plural form गृहाः means 'wife', as she is especially the person that constitutes the house; while the plural of गृहं meaning 'house' will be गृहाणि.",
    "31145": "Vart:- This affix should be confined to the verbs नृत् 'to dance', खन् 'to dig' and रञ्ज 'to dye'.\n\nThus नृत् + ष्वुन् = नर्त + अक (VII. I. I) = नर्तकः 'dancer'. The letter व is indicatory (I .3. 6) and by Rule (IV. I. 4I), it denotes that words formed by prefixes having indicatory च् form their feminine gender by the affix ङीप्. Thus the feminine of नर्तक is नर्तकी; so also खनकः 'miner', fem. खनकी; रजकः 'washer-man', fem. रजकी.\n\nIn the case of the root रञ्ज the nasal is elided. According to the opinion of the author of <i> Mahabhashya</i>, only two verbs are governed by this <i>sutra</i> namely नृत् and खन् . According to him, the verb रञ्ज takes the affix क्वुन्. Thus रञ्ज + क्वुन्  = रज् + यु [[6.4.37]] = रज् +अक (VII. I. I) = रजकः, feminine रजिका.",
    "31146": "As, गै + थकन् = गाथकः (VI. I. 45) 'a singer', sem. गाथिका.",

I) = गायनः fem. गायनी; the य is added by [[7.3.33]].\n\nThe separation of these rules (<i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> ) relating to गै is for the purpose of the <i>sutras</i> that follow. Had गस्थकन् and ण्युट् च been made one aphorism, the <i>anuvritti</i> of both these affixes would have run into the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. But it is intended that the <i>anuvritti</i> of ण्युट् should only run, and hence this <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> or division of one <i>sutra</i> into two.",
    "31148": "The verb हा denotes two verbs हाक 'to abandon' and हाङ् 'to go' both belonging to the Third Conjugation, forming जहाति and जिहीते as 3rd per. sing. Thus हा + ण्युट् = हायनः 'a kind of rice' (that which <i>jahati</i> 'leaves off' all water) हायनः 'a year' (that which jihite 'goes through' all conditions.)\n\nThe accents are however different in the two. In one case the <i>udatta</i> is on the middle; in the other, on the last.",
    "31149": "As प्रु + वुन् = प्रो + अक (VII. I. I) = प्रयकः; so also, सरकः, स्रवकः, and लयकः.\n\nThe word <i>samabhihara</i> in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the action done by the agent must be well performed. The affix <i>vun</i> being thus ordained for the action, when it is well performed, it follows, that it will not be employed where the action is repeatedly ill performed. The affix will be employed even when there is no repetition but the action is well performed even at the first attempt.",
    "31150": "As, जीव् + वुन् = जीवकः 'may he live'; नन्दकः 'may he be happy'.\n\nThe word आशीः means a sort of prayer; and it relates to action. The force of this affix is that of 'an agent with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent'.",
    "32001": "The object or <i>karma</i> is of three sorts, namely <i>nivartya</i>, <i>vikarya</i> and <i>prapya</i>.\n\nThe object which has a material cause, but such cause is however unexpressed in the sentence, is called <i>nivartya</i> object; as कुम्भम् करोति 'he makes a pot'; here मृत् 'mud' the material cause of कुम्भ is unexpressed, therefore, कुम्भ is <i>nivartya</i> object. Where the material cause itself is changed, by a modification, into something else, such an object is called <i>vikarya</i> object; as काण्डलावः 'the branch-cutter'. While the object which cannot be approached by any action, and is not affected by it, but is always constant, is called the <i>prapya</i> object; as a वेदाध्यायः 'the reading of <i>Veda</i>'; the <i>Veda</i> is always the same.\n\nThey will be illustrated by the following examples:- Of the first kind, we have कुम्भकारः 'a potter' and  नगरकारः 'a city-builder'; of the second, we have काण्डलावः 'a branch-cutter' and शरलावः 'a reed-cutter'. Of the third, वेदाध्यायः 'the learning of <i>Veda</i>' and चर्चापाठः 'the reading of <i>Charcha</i>'. But compound nouns cannot be formed of such sentences as ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village', आदित्यं पश्यति 'he sees the sun', हिमवन्तं शृणोति 'he hears the <i>Himavat</i>'. The reason is that it is against the usage of the language to form nouns out of these.\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes after the verbs शील्, काम्, भक्ष्य and आचर and the noun in composition with it, retains its original accent. As मांसशीलः 'addicted to flesh', fem. मांसशीला; मांसकामः 'loving flesh', fem. मांसकामा; मांसभक्षः 'carnivorous', fem. मांसभक्षा; and कल्याणाचारः 'good-conducted', fem. कल्याणाचारा ।\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes after the roots ईक्ष 'to look' and क्षम् 'to forbear' under similar circumstances. As सुखप्रतीक्षः, fem. सुखप्रतीक्षा 'expecting happiness'; बहुक्षमः fem. बहुक्षमा 'much forbearing'.",
    "32002": "This debars the affix  क [[3.2.3]]; as स्वर्गे + ह्वे + अण् = स्वर्गे + ह्वा + अ = स्वर्गे + ह्वाय + अ [[7.3.33]] = स्वर्गह्वायः (the य is added by rule [[7.3.33]], 'when a <i>krit</i> affix with an indicatory ण or म follows', the augment य is added after the verbs that end in long आ). So also तन्तुवायः, धान्यमायः ।",
    "32003": "This debars अण्; as गां + दा + क = गां + द + अ = गोदः 'Giver of cows', (the long आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64,) = So also, कम्बलदः 'who gives a blanket'; पार्ष्णित्रम् 'what protects the rear'; अङ्गुलित्रम् 'what protects the finger' (a thimble)'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when there is no <i>upasarga</i>'? Witness गोसन्दायः 'who ceremoniously gives a cow', वडवसन्दाय 'who ceremoniously gives a mare'. Here the compound verb सन्दा takes the affix अण्.",
    "32004": "In the three previous <i>sutras</i>, the word in composition was always in the accusative case. This <i>sutra</i> declares that with regard to the verb स्था, the <i>upapada</i> may have any case not necessarily the accusative. As समस्थः = समे तिष्ठति 'who dwells in accessible position'; and विषमस्थः 'having an inaccessible position'.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> should be divided into two <i>sutras</i> (<i>yoga</i>-<i>bibhaga</i>). Thus:- (1) सूपि ॥ The affix क comes after every root ending in long आ, when in composition with a case-inflected word; as द्वाभ्यां पिबति = द्वि + पा + क = द्विपः [[6.4.64]] 'who drinks with two organs' i.e. 'the proboscis and the mouth, an elephant'. So also पादपः 'a plant' (what drinks through the foot). कच्छपः 'a tortoise' (that always protects its mouth by drawing it in, at the approach of danger). (2) सूपिस्थः ॥ The affix क comes after the root स्था when in composition with a word ending in a case-affix. Why do we make this two-fold division, when we see the second rule is included in the first as the verb स्था also ends in a long आ ? The reason is that the first rule applies where the agent is indicated, while the second rule applies where condition is to be denoted. As आखूनामुत्थानम् = आखूत्थः 'a swarm of rats'; so also शलमोत्थः ' a swarm of locusts'.\n\nBoth the words कर्मणि and सुपि are understood in the <i>sutras</i> that follow: <i>vis</i>: the word कर्मणि in <i>sutras</i> that relate to transitive verbs, and the word सुपि everywhere else.",
    "32005": "As तुन्द परिमृज आस्ते 'he lay lazy'. So also शोकापनुदः पुत्रो जातः 'a son, destroyer of sorrow is born'.\n\nVart:- This affix is to be applied only then, when the meaning of the word to be formed is 'lazy' and 'giver of happiness'.\n\nVart:- The epithet तुन्द परिमृजः is applied to a lazy person; while तुन्द परिमार्जः means who clears his navel. So शोकापनुदः means giver of happiness, while शोकापनोदः means 'removal of sorrow'.\n\nVart:- The words मूलविभुजः 'a chariot' and the rest should be included in the subdivision of words formed by the affix क. The words belonging to this head can only be recognised by their form, there being no list of them to be found anywhere. Thus मूलविभुजः 'a chariot', नखमुचः 'a bow', काकगुह 'sesamums', कुमुदम् (कौ मोदते) 'a lotus'.",
    "32006": "We applied by <i>sutra</i> 3 the affix क after verbs that ended in long आ and had no <i>upasarga</i>. Now begins the case of verbs with <i>upasarga</i>. This debars the affix अण्; as सर्वप्रदः [[6.4.64]] 'giver of all; liberal', पथिप्रज्ञः [[6.4.64]] 'acquainted with roads'. The long आ of दा and ज्ञा is elided by [[6.4.64]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when taking प्र'? With any other <i>upasarga</i> these verbs will take the general affix अण्; as गोसन्दाय.",
    "32007": "The verb ख्या ends in long आ and by [[3.2.3]] when compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>, it would have taken the affix अण्. This debars अण्; as गोसङ्ख्या [[6.4.64]] 'a cowherd' (गा सञ्चष्टे).",
    "32008": "The phrase <i>anupasarga</i> is to be read again into this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> 3, though this <i>anuvritti</i> had temporarily lain dormant in <i>sutra</i> 6 and 7. as being unnecessary. This debars क; of this affix ट् and क are indicatory the ट् showing among others that the feminine is formed by the affix ङीप् [[4.1.14]]\n\nAs, शक्रं गायति = शक्र + गा + टक् =शक्रगः [[6.4.64]] 'who sings <i>Sakra</i> hymns'. सामगः 'singer of <i>Sama</i>'. fem. शक्रगी and सामगी ।\n\nVart:- The affix टक् comes after the verb पा when it means to drink and only when it is in composition with the words सुरा and शीधु as its object. This is an important modification of the general <i>sutra</i>. Thus सुरापः fem. सुरापी 'wine-bibber'; शीधुपः fem. शीधुपी 'spirit-drinker'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when in composition with <i>sura</i> and <i>sidhu</i>'? Observe क्षीरपा ब्राह्मणी 'the milk-drinking <i>Brahmani</i>'; formed by the affix क and the feminine, therefore, not formed by the affix ई but by आ.\n\nWhy do we say 'when पा means to drink'? When पा means 'to protect' this affix is not used; as सुरापा 'who protects wine'.\n\nWhen these words are compounded with an <i>upasarga</i> they do not take टक् but अण्; as शक्रसङ्गायः, सामसङ्गायः ।\n\nVart:- There is diversity in the <i>Chhandas</i> as to the employment of these affixes; as या ब्राह्मणी सुरापी or सुरापा भवति नैनां देवाः पतिलोकं नयन्ति 'the gods do not carry that <i>Brahmani</i> to the regions of her husband who drinks wine'.",
    "32009": "This debars अण्. The word उद्यमन् means 'to raise a load'. Thus अंशं हरति = अंशहरः 'who takes a share, or sharer'; so रिक्थहरः 'an heir'. (हृञ् + अच् = हर् + अ = हरः) [[7.3.84]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not mean to raise up'? For then the affix अण् will be employed; as भारहारः 'a burden-bearer, a porter'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after the verb ग्रह् when in composition with the words शक्ति 'spear', लाङ्गल 'plough', अङ्कुश 'goad', यष्टि 'staff', तोमर 'an iron club', घट 'jar', घटी 'a small jar', धनुष् 'a bow'; as शक्तिमग्रहः 'a lancer', लाङ्गलग्रहः 'a plough-man', अङ्कुशग्रहः 'an elephant driver', यष्टिग्रहः 'a staff-bearer', तोमरग्रहः 'a club-bearer', घटग्रहः, घटीग्रहः 'a jar-bearer', धनुग्रहः 'a bow-bearer'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after the verb ग्रह when the word सूत्र is in composition with it and the sense is that of 'holding'; as सूत्रग्रहः 'a thread-holder'. When it has not this meaning we have सूत्रग्राहः 'a thread-taker'.",
    "32010": "In this <i>sutra</i> the verb हृञ् has the sense of <i>udyamana</i> which was specifically excluded in the last. The word वयस् means the condition of human body as dependent upon time. This rule applies to those words which indicate the attainment of appropriate age for the accomplishment of objects described by the <i>upapada</i>, or the reaching of that age in which the thing described by the <i>upapada</i> naturally takes place; as अस्थिहरः श्वा 'the dog that has reached the age when it can chew bones' (lit. when it can raise it up); कवचहरः क्षत्रियकुमारः 'the <i>Kshatriya</i> boy old enough to wear (lit. 'to raise up or bear') the shield'; so that the verb here has the sense of 'raising up'.",
    "32011": "The word ताच्छील्यं means a natural inclination or habitual occupation; as पुष्पाहरः (पुष्प + आहरति = पुष्प + आहर) 'he who has a natural tendency towards fetching flowers or whose habitual occupation is to collect flowers'; so also फलाहरः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting inclination'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्; as भारमाहरति = भाराहारः 'who brings load'.",
    "32012": "This debars अण्. The words so formed are especially of feminine gender. As पूजार्हा 'deserving of respect'; so also गन्धार्हा, मालार्हा ।",
    "32013": "The verb रम् is intransitive and the verb जप् can take an object under very limited circumstances, only namely when the object denotes <i>Sabda</i> ; therefore in the case of both these verbs, the object cannot be in composition as an accusative case; therefore, the <i>upapada</i> here must be a general case-inflected word. Hence we have read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सुप् from <i>sutra</i> 4 into this, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्म्म being inapplicable here.\n\nVart:- The words to be formed must have the sense of 'elephant' and a 'tale-bearer'. Thus स्तम्बेरमते = स्तम्बेरमः 'an elephant (lit. who sports in cluster of grass)' कर्णे जपति = कर्णेजपः 'a slanderer (lit. who whispers in the ear)'.\n\nThe affix अच् is not employed when the words to be formed do not mean an 'elephant' and a 'traducer'. Thus स्तम्बे रन्ता 'who plays in clusters of grass'. कर्णे जपिता मशकः 'the mosquito that hums near the ear'.",
    "32014": "As शम् + कृ + अच्  = शङ्करः lit. 'who does good'. So also सम्भवः संवहः । All these are proper nouns.\n\nWhy have we repeated the word <i>dhatu</i> in this aphorism, when it was understood by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.91]]? To this the reply is, that the repetition of the word <i>dhatu</i> shows that there is prohibition of the affix ट, that comes after the verb कृ in certain senses [[3.2.20]], when the word शम् is in composition. The affix अच् will be employed after the verb कृ and not the affix ट्, when शम् is an <i>upapada</i>, even when the sense to be indicated is that of cause, habit &c. [[3.2.20]]. The result is that the feminine of शङ्कर will be शङ्करा, and not शङ्करी, which, had the affix been ट, would have been the proper feminine (See [[4.1.14]]). शङ्करा means 'a female-ascetic', 'a vulture' and 'one having the habit of doing good'.",
    "32015": "The word सुप् [[3.2.4]] a noun ending in a case-affix is understood in this aphorism. As खे शेते = खशयः 'who lies in the sky'.\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the words पार्श्व 'ribs', &c., though not necessarily denoting location; as पार्श्वाभ्यां शेते = पार्श्वशयः 'who reclines on his sides', उदरशयः 'who lies on his stomach', पृष्ठशयः 'who lies on his back'.\n\nVart:- And when the verb शी is preceded by the word दिग्धसह; as दिग्धेन सह शेते = दिग्धसहशयः ॥\n\nVart:- So also when the words उत्तान &c. are in composition with it denoting agent and in the nominative case. As उत्तानः शेते = उत्तानशयः I अवमूर्द्धा शेते = अवमूर्द्धाशयः ।\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> the affix डच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the word गिरि in the locative. As गिरौ शेते = गिरिशः 'who lies on the mountain'.\n\nThe letter ड of डच् is indicatory denoting that there is elision of the final vowel with what follows it (I. I. 64).",
    "32016": "The word <i>adhikarana</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood in this. As कुरुषु चरति = कुरुचरः 'who goes among the <i>Kurus</i>'. मद्रचरः 'who goes among the Madras'.\n\nOf the affix ट the real affix is अ, the letter ट being indicatory, showing that the feminine of these words is formed by the affix ङीप्. (See. [[4.1.14]]), as कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी ।",
    "32017": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'in the locative case' does not extend to this aphorism, and hence the necessity of making a distinct and separate <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus भिक्षाचरः 'a beggar' (who goes for alms); सेनाचरः 'one who goes with an army'; आदायचरः 'one who goes after having taken'.",
    "32018": "As पुरः सरति = पुरःसरः 'who goes in front, a harbinger'. So also अग्रतः सरः and अग्रसरः 'going in front, a leader'.",
    "32019": "Thus पूर्वः सरति = पूर्वसरः 'going in front'.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting the agent'? Otherwise the affix अण् will be employed. As पूर्वदेशं सरति = पूर्वसरः 'going to the east'.",
    "32020": "The word हेतु of this <i>sutra</i> means the final or conclusive cause, and is not the grammatical हेतु meaning agent. ताच्छील्य means habit, and literally, the act of being accustomed to that. आनुलोम्य comes from अनुलोम meaning 'with the hair', that is to say, regular, in natural order, successive, and hence favourable, and agreeable complaisance, acquiescence &c. Of हेतु, we have  शोककरी कन्या 'the daughter that causes sorrow'; यशस्करी विद्या 'honorable science'; कुलकरं धनं 'the family making wealth'. Of ताच्छील्य, we have श्राद्धकरः 'who performs obsequies'; अर्थकरः 'who amasses wealth'. Of आनुलोम्य, we have प्रैषकरः 'who promptly does what he is directed'; वचनकरः 'who regularly does what he is told'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when having these senses'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्. As कुम्भकारः 'potter', नगरकारः 'city-maker'.",
    "32021": "Both the words '<i>karma</i>' and '<i>sup</i>' are understood in this aphorism; that is to say, sometimes these <i>upapadas</i> stand as accusative case and sometimes they have other cases, as the construction may require. This affix ट comes when the sense is not that of cause &c., as it was in the last <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus दिवाकरः 'the sun'. The word दिवा is an indeclinable and means 'in the day time'. There the <i>upapada</i>, therefore, is in the locative case. The sun is so called, because it makes creatures active in the day time.\n\nSo विभाकरः 'the sun' (light-maker); निशाकरः 'the moon' (the night-maker); प्रभाकरः 'the sun'; भास्करः 'the sun' (the letter स is not changed into <i>visarga</i>, as it has been so read in the <i>sutra</i>); कारकरः 'agent'; अन्तकरः 'death' (end-maker); अनन्तकरः 'magnifying to any extent'; आदिकरः 'the creator'; बहुकरः 'the busy'; नान्दीकरः 'the speaker of benediction'; किङ्करः 'a servant'; लिपिकरः 'a scribe'; लिबिकरः 'a scribe'; बलिकरः 'offering sacrifice'; भक्तिकरः 'a devotee'; कर्तृकरः 'an agent'; चित्रकरः 'a painter'; क्षेत्रकरः 'a cultivator'; एककरः 'doing only one thing', द्विकरः 'doing two things'; त्रिकरः 'doing three things'; जङ्घाकरः 'a runner, an express'; बाहुकरः 'a hero', 'a manual labourer'; अहस्करः 'the sun'; तत्करः 'doing that'; यत्करः 'doing that'; धनुष्करः 'bow-maker'; अरुस्करः 'causing or inflicting wounds'.\n\nVar:- The affix अच् comes after the verb कृ when किम्, यत्, तद् and बहु are in composition with it. The speciality of ट affix is that the feminine of words derived from it is formed by long ई; while the feminine of words derived by अच् is formed by long आ. Thus किङ्करा, यत्करा, तत्करा and बहुकरा; these words might be said to belong to the अजादि class (See [[4.1.31]]).",
    "32022": "The word भृति means service for hire, wages. The word कर्म does not mean the grammatical object but the word-form कर्म; as कर्मकरः 'a hired labourer' (not a slave); otherwise the affix is अण्; as कर्मकारः 'an artisan'.",
    "32023": "This prohibition relates even when the sense is that of cause, habit &c. The affix ट being prohibited, the general affix अण् takes its place. As शब्दकारः 'sounding, sonorous'; श्लोककारः 'a verse-maker'; कलहकारः 'one who foments quarrels'; गाथाकारः 'a writer of <i>Gathas</i> or <i>prakritee</i> verses'; वैरकारः 'an enemy'; चाटुकारः 'a flatterer'; सूत्रकारः 'an author of <i>sutras</i>'; मन्त्रकारः 'a composer of <i>Mantras</i>'; पदकारः 'an author of <i>Padapatha</i>' .",
    "32024": "Thus स्तम्ब + कृ + इन् = स्तम्बकरि nom. sing. स्तम्बकरिः; so also शकृत्करिः.\n\nVar:- This rule is applicable when the sense of the words to be formed, is that of 'rice' and 'a calf' respectively. Therefore स्तम्बकरिः means 'rice', and शकृत्करिः, 'a calf'.\n\nWhen the words have not the senses of 'rice' and 'a calf', the affix अण् is employed. As स्तम्बकारः 'sheaf-maker', शकृत्कारः 'ordure-maker'.",
    "32025": "Thus दूतिहरिः 'a dog' (a carrier of skin); नाथहरिः 'a beast' (that carries its master).\n\nWhen the words formed do not denote an animal, the affix अण् is employed; as दूतिहारः 'a water-carrier' (a carrier of a leather-bag for holding water). नाथहारः 'a carrier of his master'.",
    "32026": "The word फलेग्रहिः is formed by adding the affix इन् to the verb ग्रह and making the <i>upapada</i> end in the vowel ए. Thus फलानि गृह्णाति = फलेग्रहिः 'the fruit-bearing i. e. a tree'.\n\nThe word आत्मम्भरिः is formed by adding the augment मुम् (म) to the <i>upapada</i> आत्म, and the affix इन् to the verb भृञ्. Thus आत्मानं बिभर्ति = आत्मम्भरिः 'selfish' (one who feeds his own self).\n\nThe word 'and' indicates that there are other such irregularly-formed words. As कुक्षिम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish' (caring to feed his own belly). उदम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish'.",
    "32027": "Thus ब्रह्मवनिं त्वा क्षत्रवनिम् (<i>Vaj</i>. <i>San</i>. I. 17., V. 12., VI. 3); उत नो गोपतिं (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. (VI. 53. 10)) यै ते श्वानौ पथिरक्षो (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. (X. 14. II)) इन्द्रा यातूनामभवत् पाराशरो हविर्मथीनाम् (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. (VII. 104. 21)).",
    "32028": "This affix comes after the causative of एज्. Of the affix खश् the letters ख् and श् are indicatory, the real affix is अ. The ख् indicates that the augment मुम् is added to the <i>upapada</i> ending in a vowel [[6.3.67]]. The श indicates that this is a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix (III 4. 113), and therefore the <i>vikaranas</i> like शप् &c. (III. 1. 68.) will be employed here. Thus अङ्गमेजयति = अङ्गमेजयः (अङ्ग + एजि + शप् + खश् = अङ्गम् + एजे + अ + अ) 'who awes the limbs'; जनमेजयः 'who awes man-kind'.\n\nVart:- The affix खश् comes after the verbs अज् 'to go', धेट् 'to suck', तुद् 'to strike', हा 'to leave' when in composition with the words वात 'wind', शुनी 'a bitch', तिल 'sesamum' and शर्द्ध 'flatulence'. As वातमजाः मृगाः 'swift antelopes' (going with the wind); शुनिन्धयः 'a bitch-sucker'; तिलन्तुदः 'an oilman'; शर्द्धञ्जहा माषाः 'a kind of bean' (that causes or cures flatulence). The long ई of शुनी is shortened by [[6.3.66]].",
    "32029": "The rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> as given in [[1.3.10]] does not however, apply here. For स्तन is compounded with धेट्; as (स्तन + धे + खश् = स्तन + मुम् + धे + शप् + खश् = स्तन + म् + धय् + अ + अ) = स्तनन्धयः 'an infant' (sucking the breast).\n\nBut नासिका is compounded with both ध्मा and धे; as नासिका + ध्मा + खश् = नासिक + म् + धम + अ [[6.3.66]] and (67); [[7.3.78]] = नासिकन्धमः 'blowing and breathing through the nose'. So also नासिकन्धयः 'drinking through the nose'.\n\nThat the rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> does not apply here, is indicated by the irregular construction of the <i>Dvandva</i> compound नासिकास्तनयोः. By rule (II. 2. 84.) the word स्तन containing fewer syllables ought to have stood first; one irregularity lets in another.\n\nThe feminine of स्तनन्धयः is स्तनन्धयी, as the verb धे has an indicatory ट् ।",
    "32030": "Here also the irregularly-formed <i>Dvandva</i> compound नाडीमुष्टि showes the non-applicability of the rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> ; for मुष्टि being a घि ought to have stood first [[2.2.32]].\n\nThus नाडिन्धमः 'blowing through the tube'; मुष्टिन्धमः 'blowing through the fist'; नाडिन्धयः 'sucking through the tube', an infant; मुष्टिन्धयः 'an infant'.\n\nThe word 'and' in the aphorism indicates that there are other words also so formed. Thus घटिन्धमः, घटिन्धयः, खारिन्धमः, खारिन्धयः, वातन्धमः, वातन्धयः, 'a mountain'.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is not <i>Panini</i>'s, but is really a <i>Vartika</i>, raised to the rank of a <i>sutra</i> by the author of the <i>Kasika</i>. The <i>Vartikakara</i> divides the last <i>sutra</i> in this way: (1) स्तने धेटः ॥ (2) ततो मुष्टो ध्मश्च ॥ (3) नासिकायां ध्मश्च धेटश्च ॥ (4) नाडी मुष्टि घटोखारीष्विति वक्तव्यम् ॥",
    "32031": "Thus कूलमुद्रुजति = कूलमुद्रुजः 'breaking down banks' (such as a chariot, river, elephant, &c.); कूलमुद्वहः 'tearing up or carrying away the bank'.",
    "32032": "As वहंलिहो गौः 'the shoulder-licking cow'; अभ्रंलिहो वायुः 'the cloud-licking wind'.",
    "32033": "Thus प्रस्थं पचति = प्रस्थम्पचा 'a pot having the capacity to cook a <i>prastha</i> of food'; so also द्रोणम्पचः, खारिम्पचः 'a kettle'.",
    "32034": "The aphorism has its scope when the words formed do not denote measures, which was the case in the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus मितम्पचा ब्राह्ममणी 'the <i>Brahmani</i> who cooks a little i. e. niggardly <i>Brahmani</i>'; नखम्पचा यवागूः 'the nail-scorching barley gruel'.",
    "32035": "As विधुन्तुदः राहुः 'the <i>Rahu</i> that eclipses the moon; अरुन्तुदः 'corrosive, wounding the vital parts'. For the addition of the augment मुम् after the word अरुस्, see [[6.3.67]].",
    "32036": "Thus असूर्य + दृश्  + खश् = असूर्यम्पश्यः; as असूर्यम्पश्या राजदारा 'the king's wives not even seeing the sun' (being shut up in the harem, and so having no opportunity of seeing the sun, that is, they are so well protected that even the sun cannot see them, much less any irreverent gaze).\n\nSo also ललाटन्तपः 'heating the fore-head' (such as the sun).\n\nThe word असूर्य is an incomplete or impossible compound, as the negative अ applies to the verb दृश् and not to the word सूर्य. This is in opposition to the rule of <i>samartha</i> <i>pada</i> <i>vidhi</i> (II. I. 2).",
    "32037": "Thus उग्रं पश्यति = उग्रम्पश्यः 'fierce-looking'; इरया मद्यति = इरम्मदः 'delighting in drinking an epithet of <i>Agni</i>, a flash of lightning'. So पाणिन्धमाः पन्थानः 'chilly roads'.",
    "32038": "Thus प्रियं वदति = प्रियंवदः 'who speaks kindly'; वशंवदः 'who professes submission'.\n\nOf the affix खच्, the letters ख् and च् are indicatory; ख् indicates the insertion of the augment मुम् [[6.3.37]], and च् shows that there is shortening of the vowel in certain cases [[6.4.94]].\n\nIn the case of प्रिय and वश with वद्, the affix खश् would have given the same result as the affix खच्. Making a separate affix in this <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of the aphorisms that follow, where this affix will produce different effects than खश्.\n\nVart:- The affix खच् comes after the verb गम् 'to go' when a word ending in a case-affix is in composition with it. As मितङ्गमो हस्ती 'the slow moving i. e. an elephant'; मितङ्गमा हस्तिनी 'the slow-moving i. e. a she-elephant'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes under similar circumstances when the word in composition with गम् is विहायस्; and the letter is then replaced by the word विह. As विहायसा गच्छति = विहङ्गमः 'a bird (that which goes through the sky)'.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Vartikas</i> above given, the affix खच् may optionally be considered as if it had an indicatory ड. The force of ड is to cause elision of the final vowel with what follows it. As विहङ्गः or विहङ्गमः 'a bird'. So also भुजङ्गमः or भुजङ्गः 'a serpent' (what goes crookedly).\n\nVart:- विहायस् is replaced by विह when the affix ड (III 2. 48) comes after the verb गम्; as विहङ्गः 'a bird'. Thus we have three forms: विहग, विहङ्ग, विहङ्गम ।",
    "32039": "The verb तप् belongs both to <i>Bhu</i> and <i>Chur</i> classes. Both are meant in the <i>sutra</i>. In the case of <i>Bhvadi</i>, the verb तापि is the causative ending in णि of तप्; while in <i>Churadi</i>, all verbs take णि.\n\nThus द्विषन्तं तापयति = द्विषन्तपः [[6.4.94]] 'one who destroys his enemies', so also परन्तपः 'one who subdues his enemies, a hero'.\n\nThis affix however, will not apply when the above <i>upapadas</i> are in the feminine gender. In this case the general affix अण् will be employed; as द्विषतीं तापयति = दिषतीतापः ।",
    "32040": "The word व्रत means a vow taken according to the rules of <i>Dharma</i> <i>sastra</i>. Thus वाचंयम आस्ते 'he has taken the vow of rigid silence'.\n\nWhy do we say 'vow'? Otherwise the form is वाग्यामः 'restraining speech' [[6.3.69]].",
    "32041": "As पुरं धारयति = पुरन्दरः 'name of <i>Indra</i> (who splits asunder cities)' [[6.3.69]] and [[6.4.94]]; सर्वंसहो राजा 'the king who is all-forbearing'.\nVart:- So also when the word भग is in composition with the verb दारि; as भगन्दरः 'a fistula in the anus'.",
    "32042": "As सर्वङ्कषः खलः 'a villain, a rogue'; कूलङ्कषा नदी 'a river'; अभ्रङ्कषो गिरिः 'a mountain'; करीषङ्कषा वात्या 'a strong wind'.",
    "32043": "As मेघङ्करः 'producing clouds'; ऋर्तिकरः 'giving pain'; भयङ्करः 'frightful'.\n\nVart:- The <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> applies in the case of <i>upapadas</i> like भय. &c. This is an exception to the <i>vartika</i> under (1. 1. 72.) by which, in the case of affixes, <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> was prohibited. Thus we have अभयङ्करः 'who causes security'.",
    "32044": "The word 'and' denotes that the affix खच् is also to be included.\n\nThus क्षेमकारः or क्षेमकरः 'propitious'; प्रियकारः or प्रियङ्करः 'showing kindness'; मद्रकारः or मद्रङ्करः 'causing delight'. \n\nThe repetition of the affix अण्, when its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been read into this <i>sutra</i> by using the word वा 'optionally', indicates that these words never take the affix ट of <i>sutra</i> 20 though cause, habit, &c., may be denoted; so that the feminine of those words is formed by आ and not by ई; as अल्पारम्भाः क्षेमकराः 'small beginnings lead to or cause prosperity'.",
    "32045": "The word 'सुपि' of <i>sutra</i> 4 is understood here.\n\nThus आशिसम्भवः meaning 'food', literally that by which one is satiated. आशिती भवती अनेन. Here the word denotes instrument. And आशितसम्भवः also means 'satiety', which denotes condition.",
    "32046": "Both the words कर्मणि and सुपि of <i>sutra</i> 1 and 4 are understood here and should be applied as the occasion requires. Thus विश्वम्भरा 'earth' (that which supports all); रथन्तर 'the <i>Rathantara</i> <i>Sama</i>'; पतिंवरा 'a girl' lit. (who is about to choose a husband); शत्रुञ्जयः 'an elephant' lit. (who conquers the enemy); युगन्धरः 'a mountain' or 'the pole of a carriage to which the yoke is fixed'; शत्रुंसहः '<i>Satrunsaha</i>' (withstanding an enemy); शत्रुन्तपः '<i>Satruntapa</i>' (destroying an enemy); अरिन्दमः '<i>Arindama</i>' (victorious).\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting a name' ? Observe कुटुम्बभारः 'he who supports his family'.",
    "32047": "As सुतङ्गमः '<i>Sutangama</i>'. Though the verb गम् could well have been included in the last aphorism, the separation serves the purpose of carrying the <i>anuvritti</i> of गम् into the subsequent <i>sutras</i>.",
    "32048": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सञ्ज्ञायाम् does not extend to this. As अन्तगः 'having gone to the end, thoroughly conversant'; अत्यन्तगः 'going too fast'; अध्वगः 'a way-farer'; दूरगः 'going to a distant place'; पारगः 'completely familiar'; सर्वगः 'going everywhere, the Supreme Being'; अनन्तगः 'going to infinity, moving for ever'.\n\nOf the affix ड the letter ड् is indicatory, the real affix being अ. The ड indicates that the टि portion of the word to which this is added, must be elided [[6.4.143]]; as अन्त + गम् + ड = अन्त + ग् + अ (the टि portion अम् of गम् is elided). Now though the rule [[6.4.143]] says 'when that which has an indicatory ड, follows, there is elision of the टि of a भ'; yet in the present case, such elision takes place, although the word गम् here is not one of those called भ (l. 4. 18); because the presence of ड as an indicatory letter must not be unmeaning.\n\nVart:- The ड is also employed when the words in composition are सर्वत्र 'everywhere' and पन्न 'creeping'; as सर्वत्रगः 'Supreme Spirit'; पन्नगः 'snake.'\n\nVart:- So also when the word in composition is उरस् 'breast', and there is elision of its final. As उरस् + गम् + ड = उरगः 'moving on breast, a snake'.\n\nVart:- So also with the words सु 'well' and दुर् 'bad', when the resulting words denote location. As सुगः 'that in which one goes easily, easy of access'. दुर्गः 'difficult of access, a fort'.\n\nVart:- So also with the preposition निर्, the word to be formed meaning country; as निर्गः 'a country'.\n\nVart:- Others say, that this ड is added when other words besides the above stand as <i>upapadas</i>. Thus स्त्र्यगारगः (स्त्री + अगार + गम् + ड) 'who goes to the women's compartment'; ग्रामगः 'going to the village'; गुरुतल्पगः 'who pollutes the bed of his guru'.",
    "32049": "The affix ड is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus तिमिं वध्यात् = तिमिहः 'may he kill the whale'; शत्रुहः 'may he kill the enemy'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when benediction is intended'? Otherwise we have शत्रुघातः 'who kills his enemy'.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes after the verb आहन् when the word दारु 'wood' is in composition with it, and the final letter of the word so formed is changed into ट, when the word so formed denotes a name. As दारु आहन्ति = दार्वाघाटः (दारु + आहन् + अण्) 'the wood-pecker'.\n\nVart:- So also optionally when the word चारु 'beautiful' is in composition under the circumstances detailed in the last <i>vartika</i>: as चार्वाघाटः or चार्वाघातः ।\n\nVart:- So also, when the verb हन् is preceded by the preposition सम्, and is in composition with a word in the objective case, the affix अण् is employed; and the final is replaced by ट; as वर्णान् संहन्ति = वर्णसङ्घाटः or वर्णसङ्घातः 'the alphabet'; पदानि संहन्ति = पदसङ्घाटः or पदसङ्घातः 'connecting the words that are separated, an annotator'.",
    "32050": "As, क्लेशापहः पुत्रः 'the pain-allayer i. e. the son'; तमोपहः सूर्यः 'the darkness-destroyer i. e. the sun'.\n\nThis aphorism has its scope when the sense is not that of benediction.",
    "32051": "The affix णिनि comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when the word in composition with it is कुमार 'a child', or शीर्ष 'head'.\n\nThus कुमार + हन् + णिनि = कुमार + घात + इन् [[7.3.54]] and [[7.3.32]] = कुमारघातिन् nom. sing. कुमारघाती 'child-killer'. So also शीर्षघातिन् nom. sing. शीर्षघाती 'head-killer'.\n\nThe word शीर्ष is an irregular form of the word शिरस् ।",
    "32052": "The word लक्षणा of this <i>sutra</i> gives rise to the doubt whether it means लक्षणे कर्तरि or लक्षणवति कर्तरि. In the former case the meaning will be 'when the agent is itself the mark'; as जायाघ्नः 'a mole' (a mark on the body indicative of the death of one's wife). In the latter case the meaning will be 'when the agent is possessed of the attribute denoted by the word'; as जायाघ्नः 'the murderer of his wife'; पतिघ्नी 'the murderer of her husband'.\n\nOf the affix टक् the letters ट् and क् are indicatory. The ट् shows that the feminine is formed by ई, and क् causing elision of the penultimate अ of हन्. Thus जाया + हन् + टक् = जाया + ह्न् + अ [[6.4.98]] = जायाघ्नः [[7.3.54]].",
    "32053": "As जायाघ्नस्तिलकालकः 'the mole' (literally that which indicates the death of one's wife); पतिघ्नी पाणिरेखा 'the line of the palm of the hand' (that which indicates the death of one's husband). These two forms were deducible also from the last aphorism. श्लेष्मघ्नं मधु 'honey' (literally that which has the property of destroying the phlegm). पित्तघ्नं घृतं 'clarified butter' (lit. that which destroys the bile).\n\nWhy do we say 'when the agent is not a human being'? Observe आखुघातः शूद्रः 'a <i>Sudra</i>' (literally one who kills the mice). Here the affix is अण्.\n\nWhy is the affix टक् not employed in the following? चौरघातो हस्ती 'an elephant' (i.e. who kills a thief.) Here the word is formed by the affix अण् on the analogy of <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.113]] which allows a diversity in case of <i>kritya</i> affixes, which diversity is extended in this case to a <i>krit</i> affix.",
    "32054": "This <i>sutra</i> applies where the agent is a human being. As हस्तिनं हन्तुं शक्तः = हस्तिघ्नः मनुष्यः 'a man who is strong enough to kill an elephant'; so also कपाटघ्नः 'a burglar' (who is capable of breaking open the doors).\n \nWhy do we say 'where power is indicated'? Observe विषेण हस्तिनं हन्ति = हस्तिघातः 'who kills the elephant by poison'. Here the affix is अण्.",
    "32055": "These forms are thus evolved. The affix क is employed after the verb हन् in composition with पाणि 'hand' and ताड 'a blow' as object; then the टि portion of हन् i. e. अन् is elided, and ह is changed into घ irregularly. Thus पाणि + हन् + क = पाणि + ड् + अ = पाणिघः 'a drummer' (workman or handicraftsman); ताडघः 'a smith'.\n\nWhy 'when denoting an artificer'? Observe पाणिघातः 'boxing'; ताडघातः 'hammering'.\n\nVart:- The word राजघः should be enumerated in this connection; राजघः 'a regicide'.",
    "32056": "The affix च्वि (V. 4. 50.) is added to a noun when it is in composition with the verbs भू 'to become', कृ 'to make' and अस् 'to be'; its force being that a thing attains to a condition in which it previously was not. The च्वि being an optional affix, its sense is two-fold; namely, words ending in च्वि and words not ending in च्वि. Both may have the force of च्वि. In the present <i>sutra</i>, however, the words that actually end in च्वि have been excluded, while words which do not take the affix च्वि, but have the force of च्वि are included in the present <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus आढ्य + कृ + ख्युन् = आढ्य + कर् + अन् = आढ्यं करणं 'that by the instrumentality of which the poor becomes rich, viz., wealth, prosperity, means of enriching'; सुभगङ्करणम् 'making happy'; स्थूलङ्करणम् 'by which one becomes big'; पलितङ्करणम् 'rendering grey'; नग्नङ्करणम् 'making naked'; अन्धङ्करणम् 'making blind'; प्रियङ्करणम् 'showing kindness'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the force is that of the affix च्वि'? Otherwise आढ्यं तैलेन कुर्वन्ति i.e अभ्यजयन्ति 'they anoint with oil'. Here though something is joined with what it previously was not joined, namely with oil, yet as the radical word is not prominent here, the sense is not that of च्वि and hence this counter-example.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not ending in the affix च्वि'? Observe आढ्यी कुर्वन्ति अनेन 'they make rich by this'. Here the affix ख्युन् is not employed.\n\nIt might be objected : 'well if ख्युन् is not used, then the affix ल्युट् must be used [[3.3.117]] as there is no difference between ख्युन् and ल्युट्; both having the efficient portion यु; what is then the use of prohibiting च्वि? We reply, 'because there is this prohibition, when the affix ख्युन् is not employed the affix ल्युट् will also be not employed. Thus by implication the affix ल्युट् is also prohibited. The prohibition of च्वि in this <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of the aphorisms that follow'.\n\nPatanjali observes this prohibition as superfluous, because there is no distinction between ल्युट् and ख्युन्. For the word formed by any one of these affixes have the same form and the same accent. Nor there is any distinction in the feminines of their derivatives. For the word formed by नञ्, स्नञ्, ईक्, अक् and ख्युन् take ई in the feminine as well as the words तरुन and तलन. Nor there is any distinction in their <i>samasas</i>. For in both the cases it will be <i>nitya</i> <i>samasa</i>. Nor is the prohibition made for the sake of the augment मुम्. For it being an indeclinable, मुम् cannot come after it. The prohibition therefore is of no use to this <i>sutra</i> but it is inserted here for the sake of the following <i>sutras</i>.",
    "32057": "Thus आढ्यम्भविष्णुः 'becoming rich (who was not rich before)'; आढ्यम्भावुकः 'becoming rich'; सुभगम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming happy'; स्थूलम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming big'; पलितम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming grey'; नग्नम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming naked'; अन्धम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming blind'; प्रियम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming an object of affection, amiable'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the agent'? Not so when it denotes the instrument. The affixes will apply when the sense of the <i>upapada</i> is that of च्वि, otherwise not; as आढ्यीं भविता 'he will be rich'.\n\nThese affixes will not apply when the <i>upapada</i> ends in च्वि; आढ्यी भविता ।",
    "32058": "By <i>sutra</i> 4 of this chapter, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सुपि is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. It might be objected 'why do we not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्म instead of सुपि, because the verb स्पृश् is a transitive verb, and after such verbs, the <i>anuvritti</i> of कर्म ought to come by <i>sutra</i> 4'? To this we say there is no harm in reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of सुपि in this case; because the word कर्तरि of the last <i>sutra</i> is also, in a way understood here, and indicates the collection of all sorts of agents whether objects, instruments &c., and this can only be when the first member of the compound is a word in general.\n\nThus घृतं स्पृशति = घृतस्पृश्, nom. sing. घृतस्पृक् 'he who touches clarified butter'. स्पृश् + क्विन् + सु = स्पृश् + वि + ० [[6.1.68]] = स्पृक् + ० (VI. 1. 67,) and [[8.2.62]]. So also मन्त्रेण स्पृशति = मन्त्रस्पृक् 'who touches with hymns'; जलेन स्पृशति = जलस्पृक् 'who touches with water'. But उदकेन स्पृशति = उदकस्पर्शः; here we have the general affix अण्.\n\nThe न् of क्विन् is to distinguish this affix from affixes like क्विप् &c. For, had it been merely क्वि, then in <i>sutra</i> (VIII. 2. 62.) we should have used क्वि प्रत्ययस्य कुः, and it would have been ambiguous, for क्वि might be explained as meaning both क्वि and क्विप्, as क्य means क्यष्, क्यप् &c. To remove this ambiguity, न् is added to make a distinctive affix. The न् cannot be for the sake of accent. [[6.1.117]], the verb being monosyllabic would of itself have taken that accent.",
    "32059": "The first five words are irregular forms. Thus ऋतु + यज् + क्विन् = ऋत्विक् 'he who performs sacrifice in the season (ऋतौ) or to the season (ऋतुम्). This word, however is a रूढि word in which it is fruitless to search for its etymological meaning. धृष् + क्विन् = दधृक्. Here there is reduplication and the final has acute accent. सृज् + क्विन् = स्रक्. Here there is augment अस्. दृश् + क्विन् = दिक्. So also उत् + स्निह् + क्विन् = उष्णिक्. All these are in fact crude nouns, their current meaning having little traces of their root meaning.\n\nThe affix क्विन् comes after the three roots युज्, अञ्चु, and क्रुञ्च. Being read along with the five above-mentioned irregularly-formed words, there is some irregularity in the application of क्विन् to these verbs. Thus the affix क्विन् comes after अञ्चु only when a word ending with any case-affix precedes it in composition. As प्र + अञ्चु + क्विन् = प्राञ्च् nom. sing. प्राङ् [[6.4.24]]; (VII. I. 70), (VIII. 2. 23 and 62) 'east'; so also प्रत्यङ् 'west'; उदङ् 'north'.\n\nThe affix क्विन् comes after युजिर् and क्रुञ्च् when these are uncombined. Thus युज् + क्विन् = युज्. In nominative singular, युज् + सु = युञ्ज् + स् [[7.1.71]] = युञ्ज् + ० [[6.1.68]] = युङ् [[8.2.62]] 'who joins'. When the root युज् is in composition with an <i>upapada</i>, it takes the affix क्विप् (see <i>sutra</i> 61). As अश्वयुक् 'yoked with horses'.\n\nSo also क्रुञ्च् + क्विन् = क्रुञ्च्, nom. sing. क्रुङ्, 'a curlew'. The non-elision of the ञ [[6.4.24]] of क्रुञ्च् is an irregularity, as this word has been taught in connection with other irregular words.",
    "32060": "The force of 'and' is that the क्विन् also comes under similar circumstances. त्यद् &c. are pronouns, for a list of which see [[1.1.27]]. Thus त्यादृश् nom. sing. त्यादृक्, 'such-like' when it is formed by क्विन्; and त्यादृशः 'such-like' when the affix is कञ्. So also तद् + दृश् + क्विन् = तादृश् [[6.3.91]] nom. sing. तादृक् [[6.1.68]], (VIII. 2. 36 and 62), [[8.4.56]]; and तादृशः when कञ् is the affix. So यादृक् or यादृशः 'what-like'.\n\nWhat is the force of the letter ञ् of कञ्? It is for the sake of accent; the <i>udatta</i> is on the first syllable of those words which are formed by an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् [[6.1.117]]. But the indicatory न् would have given the same accent, there being no difference between कञ् and कन् in this respect. The indicatory ञ् then serves only the purpose of distinguishing the affix कञ् from कन् in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.15]] in which कञ् is taken and not कन्. Had we not formed this separate affix, then for कञ्करप् of that <i>sutra</i>, we should have read कन् क्वरप् so that the feminine of words formed by कन् would have also taken long ई, so that the feminine of यावकः (याव + कन्) [[5.4.29]] would have been यावकी instead of यावका.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not signifying perception'? See तं पश्यति = तद्दर्शः 'who sees that'. The words त्यादृक्, तादृश् &c. are crude nouns, in which the etymological sense of the root not being visible, the act of seeing can never be denoted by these words.\n\nVart:- This rule applies also when the words समान and अन्य are in composition with दृश्. As सदृक् or सदृशः 'like' (समान + दृश् + क्विन् = स + दृश्) [[6.3.89]]; so also अन्यादृशः or अन्यादृक् 'of another kind'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्स comes also after the root दृश्. As तादृक्षः, यादृक्षः, अन्यादृक्षः and कीदृक्षः । तद् + दृश् + क्स = ता + दृश् + क्स (VI. 3. 91.) = तादृष् + स [[8.2.36]] = तादृक् + स [[8.2.41]] = तादृक् + ष [[8.3.59]] = तादृक्षः ।",
    "32061": "The phrase 'the word ending with a case-affix' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The <i>anuvritti</i> of कर्म is not to be taken in this <i>sutra</i> for the same reasons as in <i>sutra</i> 58 <i>ante</i>. The <i>upasargas</i> are also words ending in a case-affix i. e. they are also <i>subanta</i> words. Their special mention in this section, indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>) that wherever in the previous <i>sutras</i>, the word <i>subanta</i> (a case-inflected word) is used, it does not include an <i>upasarga</i> (III 1. 106).\n\nThe root सू being read in conjunction with द्विष् shows that अदादि class verb is meant here, and not तुदादि class. The verb युज् includes, both युजिर् 'to join' and युज् 'to concentrate one's mind'. The verb विद् includes the three verbs having the sense of 'to know', 'to become' and 'to consider', but does not include the verb विद् 'to gain', because that root has an indicatory लृ (विद्लृ) while all these verbs have indicatory अ.\n\nThus, सत्-शुचिषत् 'dwelling in purity'; अन्तरिक्षसत् 'dwelling in the skies', 'epithets of <i>Brahma</i>' (<i>Kath</i>.

(Why is there cerebral ण in these words ? Because the word ग्रामणी has a cerebral ण in <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.78]] and that indicates that these words will have ण, as also by <i>sutra</i> [[8.4.3]]). राज् - विराट् 'splendour'; सम्राट् 'emperor' (the letter म is added by <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.25]]).\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is a continuation and expansion of <i>sutras</i> 75 and 76 <i>sup</i>.",

To this the <i>vartika</i> replies: 'This has been made a separate <i>sutra</i> in order to indicate that the rule of वासरूप [[3.1.94]] does not apply here. Therefore the affix अण् will not apply in the alternative. If the affix अण् does not apply, how then we get the form क्रव्यादः which is evidently formed by the affix अण् ? The affix अण् comes after the root when the word formed means the eater of meat which has been cut, dressed and cooked'; thus क्रव्यादः means a man who eats meat cooked and prepared, i. e. a meat-eater as opposed to a vegetarian, while क्रव्यात् means an animal which eats raw flesh; the word क्रव्यादः in fact may be regarded as an irregular form falling under पृषोदरादि class of <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.109]].",

    "32071": "The above words contain both the verb and the <i>upapada</i>; the fact of their being so given indicates that there is some irregularity in the application of the affix.\n\nThus the affix ण्विन् comes after the verb वह् preceded by the <i>upapada</i> श्वेत as denoting an agent, while the force of the whole word so formed denotes an object. As श्वेता एनं वहन्ति = श्वेतवाह् nom. sing. श्वेतवाः 'a name of Indra' (whom white horses carry).\n\nThe affix ण्विन् is applied to the verb शंस् 'to praise' when preceded by the word उक्थ as object or instrument; and then the nasal is irregularly dropped. As उक्थानि उक्थैर्वा शंसति = उक्थशास्, nom. sing. उक्थशाः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. II. 39. 1.) 'a reciter of hymns, the name of the sacrificer'.\n\nThe ण्विन् is applied after the verb दाशृ 'to give', preceded by पुरो, and द is changed into ड, the force of the whole word denoting an object.

The form उपयज् is found in the <i>Chhandas</i> only, and not in the ordinary literature.",
    "32074": "The force of 'and' is to include विच्. Thus सुदा + मनिन् = सुदामन्, 1st. sing. सुदामा (<i>Rig</i>.

II. 27. 17) 'liberal'; घृतपावन् 1st. sing. घृतपावा (<i>Yaj</i>. VI. 19) ghee-drinker'.\n\nThe affix विच् is also included in this aphorism. As कीलाल + पा + विच् = कीलालपाः (<i>Rig</i>. X. 91. 14) 'nectar-drinker'; शुभंवाः (<i>Rig</i>. IV. 3. 6.) and <i>Panini</i> [[7.3.46]] 'beautifully going'; रामस्योपदाः 'an offering of <i>Rama</i>.'

VI. 18).\n\nThe word 'also' in this aphorism has the force of removing all conditions under which these affixes were employed in the previous aphorisms, that is to say, these affixes come even when there is no <i>upapada</i>. As पीवा, धीवा.\n\nThe words 'are seen' in this <i>sutra</i> show that all verbs do not admit of these affixes indiscriminately. It is only when we see a particular form that we can infer the existence of these affixes.",

    "32077": "Why has this aphorism been made, when by rule (III. I. 4), स्था would have taken क and by rule [[3.1.75]], it would have taken क्विप् also? This repetition is for the purpose of prohibiting the prohibition, that is to say, the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.14]] prohibited the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.4]], and the present <i>sutra</i> removes that prohibition. Thus शंस्थः and शंस्थाः । But for this <i>sutra</i>, this form could not have been evolved; for, with the <i>upapada</i> शम्, the verb स्था would have taken the affix अच् by [[3.2.14]].",
    "32078": "Thus उष्ण + भुज् + णिनि = उष्णभोजिन्, 1st. sing. उष्णभोजी 'who eats his meal hot'. So also शीतभोजी &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not mean a genus'? Witness ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयिता 'the inviter of <i>Brahmanas</i>'. We cannot form ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयी\n\nWhy do we say 'when habit is to be expressed'? Witness उष्णं भुङ्क्ते कदाचित् 'he sometimes eats hot'.\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>supi</i>' was understood in this aphorism, its repetition here declares that <i>upasargas</i> are not included. This is contested by the author of the <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>. According to him this affix comes even with <i>upasargas</i>. As अनुनायित्, अनुजीविन्, उपजीविन् &c.\n\nVart:- The verb आसृ in composition with the prepositions उत् or प्रति should be enumerated as taking this affix. As उदासारिन्, fem. उदासारिणी, 1st. plural उदासारिण्यः. So also प्रत्यासारिणी, pl. प्रत्यासारिण्यः ।\n\nVart:- So also when the sense is 'having skill in such and such action'. As साधुकारी 'excellent worker'; साधुदायी 'giving liberally'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verb वद preceded by ब्रह्म. As ब्रह्मवादिन्, in ब्रह्मवादिनो वदन्ति 'the knowers of <i>Brahma</i> say'.",

Witness as अपूपानिव भक्षयति माषान् 'he eats <i>masha</i> like <i>apupa</i>'. Here अपूपा is object and not agent, and hence no composition takes place.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a standard of comparison'? Otherwise there will be no composition. As उष्ट्रः क्रोशति 'the camel makes noise'. For the accents of these words, see [[6.2.80]].",
    "32080": "The word व्रत means a 'vow' as regulated and ordained by the Scriptures. This condition 'when vow is expressed' applies to the completed word, that is to say, when the complete word made up of the root, the <i>upapada</i>, and the affix, denotes a vow. As स्थण्डिलशायिन् 'the vow of sleeping on bare ground (and nowhere else) or a person who has taken this vow'. अश्राद्धभोजिन् 'who has vowed not to eat during the performance of a <i>Sraddha</i> ceremony.\n\nWhy do we say 'when vow is to be expressed'?

    "32081": "The word आभीक्ष्ण्य means continued repetition, that is to say, zealous practice or assiduous performance of anything, but does not mean habit. As कषायपायिणो गान्धाराः 'the people of <i>Gandhara</i> are <i>kashaya</i>-drinkers'. कषाय + पा + णिनि = कषाय + पा + युक् + णिनि [[7.3.33]]. So also क्षीरपायिण उशीनाराः 'the people of <i>Usinara</i> are milk-drinkers'. सौवीर-पायिणो बाह्लीकाः 'the people of <i>Bahlika</i> are <i>sauvira</i>-drinkers'.\n \nBy using the word 'diversely' in the <i>sutra</i>, this affix is not applied in other places, as in the following :- कुल्माषखादः 'a grain eater'.",
    "32082": "The word '<i>supi</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. As दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; शोभनम्मानी 'who thinks himself beautiful'.\n\nThe verb मन् belonging to the 4th conjugation is taken here and not that belonging to the 8th conjugation; because the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'diversely' is understood here. In the present aphorism, whether we take the <i>Divadi</i> or <i>Tanadi</i> मन् the resulting form would be the same, namely मानिन्. But not so in the next aphorism, where before the affix खश् there would be difference of form owing to the <i>vikarana</i> i. e., in the 4th conjugation श्यन् would be added, but not so if the verb belonged to the 8th class.",
    "32083": "The word आत्ममान means thinking of one's own self. By the word 'and' it is meant that the affix णिनि may be employed in the same sense. This rule applies where the agent, indicated by the sense of the affix, thinks himself possessed of the qualities of 'handsomeness' &c., denoted by the <i>upapada</i>. As दर्शनीयम्मन्यः or दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; पण्डितम्मन्यः or पण्डितमानी 'who thinks himself learned'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when employed to signify thought whereof the object is self'? Witness दर्शनीयमानी देवदत्तस्य यज्ञदत्तः ' <i>Yajnadatta</i> is thought handsome by <i>Devadatta</i>'.\n\nOf the affix खश् the letter ख् causes मुम् augment by [[6.3.66]]; and श् makes it a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix, which brings in the proper <i>vikaranas</i>. The affixes so far treated of are applicable in all tenses. The others that follow denote some particular time.",
    "32084": "The phrase 'with the sense of past time' is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing aphorism and exerts its influence up to aphorism 123 of this chapter; that is to say, these affixes give a signification of the past tense to the verb whose <i>anuvritti</i> is also understood throughout the subsequent <i>sutras</i>; see [[3.1.91]].\n\nThus it will be taught in the next aphorism: 'after the verb यज्, when the word in composition is in the instrumental case, the affix णिनि is employed'. Here to complete the sense we must read into the <i>sutra</i>, the words 'with the sense of past time'. As अग्निष्टोमेनेष्टवान् = अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with an <i>Agnishtoma</i> or a five-day series of offerings'.\n\nWhy do we say 'with the sense of past time' ? Otherwise these affixes will not be employed. As अग्निष्टोमेन यजति 'he sacrifices with <i>Agnishtoma</i>'.",
    "32085": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of णिनि and not of खश् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. As अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with <i>Agnishtoma</i>. Here <i>Agnishtoma</i> is the instrument for the attainment of the desired fruit.",
    "32086": "As पितृव्यघातिन् 'who has killed his paternal uncle'; मातुलघातिन् 'who has killed his maternal uncle'; हन् + णिनि = घन् + णिनि [[7.3.54]] = घत् + णिनि [[7.3.32]] = घातिन् [[7.2.116]].\n\nThis affix is employed only when censure is implied. Therefore it is not employed in चोरं हतवान् 'he has killed the thief'.\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्मणि of this aphorism extends up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.96]].",
    "32087": "As ब्रह्महन्, 1st. sing. ब्रह्महा 'who has killed a <i>Brahmana</i>'; भ्रूणहा 'who has killed a foetus'; वृत्रहा 'who has killed <i>Vritra</i>, a name of <i>Indra</i>'.\n\nSince by <i>sutra</i> 76 <i>ante</i>, the affix क्विप् was ordained to come after all verbs, and therefore would have come after the verb हन् also, where is the necessity of the present aphorism? This aphorism makes a <i>niyama</i>. i.e. the verb हन् takes the affix क्विप् only when it is in composition with the words ब्रह्म &c. Four-fold restriction is here intended.\n\n(1) When हन् has <i>upapada</i>, the words ब्रह्म &c., and not any other word; as पुरुषं हतवान् 'he has killed the man'.\n\n(2) When the words ब्रह्म &c. are <i>upapadas</i> of any other verb than हन्, then this affix is not employed; so that the verb must be हन्; thus ब्रह्माधीतवान् 'he has read the <i>Veda</i>'.\n\n(3) The क्विप् is the only affix to denote past time in the case of हन् preceded by ब्रह्म &c., and no other affix can be employed in this sense.\n\n(4) This is employed only in the past tense and not in any other tense; as ब्रह्माणं हन्ति or हनिष्यति 'he kills or will kill the <i>Brahmana</i>'. This <i>sutra</i> anticipates the diversity taught in the next <i>sutra</i>, and is an example of बहुलं use of the affix.",
    "32088": "This aphorism ordains क्विप् in cases which are not governed by the restrictive rule contained in the last aphorism. As मातृहा सप्तमं नरकं प्रविशेत् 'may the matricide enter the seventh hell'; so also पितृहा 'patricide'.\n\nDiversely we find also मातृघातः and पितृघातः।",
    "32089": "The phrase 'in the accusative case' is understood in this aphorism, and applies to all the above-mentioned words, except सु, which being an attributive word, of course, cannot take any case-terminations. As सुकृत् [[6.1.71]] 'who has done well'; कर्मकृत् 'who has done all works'; पापकृत् 'who has committed sins'; मन्त्रकृत् 'who has made a mantra'; पुण्यकृत् 'who has done virtuous actions'.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> also ordains a restrictive rule or <i>niyama</i>. Three-fold restriction is intended here: namely, restrictions with regard to time, <i>upapada</i>, and affix; but not with regard to verbs. See [[3.2.87]]. There being no restriction with regard to the root, this affix is employed when words other than these are <i>upapadas</i>. As, शास्त्रकृत् 'who has made Scriptures'; भाष्यकृत् 'who has made a commentary'. The त् is added to the root by [[6.1.71]].",
    "32090": "As, सोमसुत् 'who has pressed the <i>soma</i> juice, or <i>soma</i>-distiller'; 1st. dual सोमसुतौ; 1st. plural सोमसुतः ।\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is also for the sake of making a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule. The four-fold restriction is here intended. i. e. as regards the verb, the tense, the <i>upapada</i> and the affix.",
    "32091": "As, अग्निचित् 'one who has kept the sacred fire'; 1st. dual अग्निचितौ; 1st. plural अग्निचितः ।\n\nHere also, as in the last aphorism, four-fold restriction is intended.",
    "32092": "The words चेः and कर्मणि are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The Name is expressed by taking the complete word consisting of the verbal root, the <i>upapada</i> and the affix. As श्येनचित् 'a fire which has been arranged in the shape of a hawk'; कङ्कचित् 'fire arranged like a heron'.\n\nThe word आख्या indicates that these words are <i>rudhi</i> words, their sense depending upon usage rather than etymology. The arrangement of bricks for sacrificial purpose with regard to fire, gets these various names; that is, when the bricks are arranged like a falcon, it is called श्येनचित्, and so on.",
    "32093": "The repetition of the word कर्मणि in the <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> might have been drawn from the last aphorism, indicates that when the object carries with it a sense of censure on the agent, then only this affix is employed and not with every and any object. As सोमविक्रयिन् 'the seller of <i>soma</i> plant'; रसविक्रयिन् 'the seller of liquors'; employing disapproval of the action of those persons who carry on these mean professions. But not so in धान्यविक्रायः 'the seller of paddy'.",
    "32094": "As मेरुदृश्वन्, 1st. sing. मेरुदृश्वा 'who has seen the Meru'. परलोकदृश्वा 'who has seen the hereafter.'\n\nThough the affix क्वनिप् was valid by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.75]] its repetition here shows that no other affix comes in this sense after this verb.",
    "32095": "How can the verb युध्, which is an intransitive verb, govern an object ? It is a transitive verb, in as much as it is taken to be a causative verb, with the णिच् affix latent. As राजयुध्वन्,1st. sing. राजयुध्वा [[8.2.7]] 'who has caused the king to fight'; राजकृत्वन्, 1st. sing. राजकृत्वा (VI.1.71.) 'who has made a king'.",
    "32096": "The word सह, being a particle, and not denoting a substance, is incapable of taking any case. As सहयुध्वन् 'who has made to fight with'; सहकृत्वन् 'who has done any thing along with another'.",
    "32097": "As उपसरे जातः = उपसरजः । जन् + ड = ज् + अ [[6.4.143]] = ज 'born of the first conception'; मन्दुरजः 'born in the stable'.",
    "32098": "As बुद्धिजः 'born through understanding'; संस्कारजः 'born of habit'; दुखजः 'born through pain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not denoting a genus'? Observe हस्तिनो जातः 'born of elephant'; अश्वाज्जातः 'born of horse'.",
    "32099": "The term here being simply appellative, and not descriptive, cannot be explained by giving the signification of its component elements. As प्रजाः 'people', or 'a son'; as in the sentence अथेमा मानवी प्रजाः ।",
    "32100": "As पुमनुजा 'a girl born after the male child i. e. a girl having an elder brother'; स्त्र्यमनुजः 'a boy born after the female child i. e. a boy having an elder sister'.",
    "32101": "Thus the locative case has been dealt with in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.97]]; but the affix comes when the <i>upapada</i> has any other case than the seventh. As न जायते = अजः 'unborn'; द्विर्जातः = द्विजः 'twice-born'.\n\nThus, it is said in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.98]] that the <i>upapada</i> may be in the ablative case, when genus is not denoted. We see, however, the affix employed when genus is denoted. As ब्राह्मणजो धर्मः; क्षत्रियजं युद्धम् ।\n\nIt is declared in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.98]] that when appellative is meant, the affix ड comes after the compound verb जन्. We find, however, the affix employed when the sense is not simply appellative; as अभिजाः or परिजाः 'born or produced all round i.e. hair'.\n\nIt is declared in <i>sutra</i> (III. 2. 100.). 'When an object is in composition with the verb अनुजम् this affix is employed'. But it may also be employed when no object is in composition. As अनुजः 'born after i. e. younger brother'.\n\nThe force of the word अपि 'though' is to free this rule from all restrictions and conditions. So this affix comes after other verbs and other cases in composition with such verbs. As परितः खाता = परिखा 'a moat' (literally that which has been dug all round); आखा 'a pond'.",
    "32102": "The affixes क्त and क्तवतु are निष्ठा [[1.1.26]]. As कृ + क्त = कृतम् 'made'; कृ + क्तवतु = कृतवत्,1st. sing. कृतवान् 'done'; so also भुक्तम् and भुक्तवान् 'eaten'.\n\nVart:- The <i>Nishtha</i> affixes come when <i>adi</i>-<i>karma</i> is meant. For a fuller description of what constitutes <i>adi</i>-<i>karma</i> see <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.71]], and the illustrations under it. Thus प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः, प्रकृतवान् कटं देवदत्तः ।",
    "32103": "As सु + ङ्वनिप् = सुत् + वन् (VI. I 71) = सुत्वन् 1st. sing. सुत्वा 'who has pressed out or extracted juice'; यज्वन्, 1st. sing. यज्वा 'who has sacrificed'. The त् is added by [[6.1.71]]. See <i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. [[1.3.1]].",
    "32104": "As जृ + अतृन् = जर् + अव् [[7.3.84]] = जरत्, 1st. sing. जरन्, 1st. dl. जरन्तौ, 1st. pl. जरन्तः 'grown old' (VII 1. 70).\n\nBy the rule of वासरूप [[3.1.94]], the <i>Nishtha</i> affixes also come after this verb. As जीर्णः and जीर्णवान् । जृ + क्त = जिर् + त [[7.1.100]] and [[1.1.51]] = जिर् + न [[8.2.42]] = जीर्ण [[8.2.77]] and (VIII. 4. I) 'grown old'.",
    "32105": "As अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श 'I saw the sun from both sides'; अहं द्यावापृथिवी आततान 'I stretched the heaven and the earth'. Here the words ददर्श and आततान have the force of <i>nishtha</i>. See <i>Yaj</i>. <i>Ved</i>. (VIII. 9).\n\nWhy this separate <i>sutra</i>, when by aphorism [[3.4.61]], in the <i>Chhandas</i> the <i>lun</i>, <i>lan</i> and <i>lit</i> come in all tenses ? That rule is made with regards to two or more verbs when in syntactical relation (धातुसम्बन्ध) with each other [[3.4.1]]. The present rule is general, and without any such limitations.\n\n<i>Lit</i> is the affix of the Present Perfect and will be fully treated of in the conjugation of verbs.",
    "32106": "As अग्निं चिक्यानः 'he consecrated the fire'; सोमं सुषुवाणः 'he pressed the <i>soma</i> juice'. This being an optional affix, is sometimes not employed; as in the examples in the last aphorism.\n\nWhy has the word <i>lit</i> been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, when its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been drawn from the last <i>sutra</i> ? The substitute कानच् replaces not only the special लिट् of <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.105]], but the general लिट् which comes after the roots in forming the perfect tense; so that the affix कानच् forms verbal adjectives as well as the perfect tense.\n\nThis affix comes after those verbs only which take <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations. See [[1.4.100]]. तूतुजान (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. [[1.3.6]]).",
    "32107": "As जक्षिवस् 1st. sing. जक्षिवान् 'eaten' (<i>Yaj</i>. (VIII. 19)); पपिवस् 1st. sing. पपिवान् 'drunk'.\n\nSometimes it does not come, as in the example under <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.105]]; अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श.\n\nThe division of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, in which it could well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, into which the <i>anuvritti</i> of क्वसु only runs.",
    "32108": "This being a substitute only, the original affix लिट् also comes after these verbs. As, उपसेदिवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम् '<i>Kautsa</i> served <i>Panini</i>'. In the alternative, the proper affixes of the past tense will be employed. As उपासदत् 'he served'; उपासीदत् and उपससाद्.\n\nSo also अनूषिवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम्. In the alternative we have अन्ववासीत्, अन्ववसत् and अनूवास.\n\nSo also उपशुश्रुवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम्. In the alternative we have उपाश्रौषीत्, उपाश्रुणोत् and उपशुश्राव.  \n\nThe affix क्वसु is employed with the force of लुङ्, and लङ् also.",
    "32109": "These forms are thus evolved:- To the verb इ 'to go' with the preposition उप, the affix क्वसु is added: as उप + इ + क्वसु. The root is reduplicated: as उप + ई + इ + क्वसु. The reduplicate is here long ई by [[7.4.69]]. This long ई does not coalesce with the short इ by the rules of <i>sandhi</i>; for then the rule by which this ई was introduced would have no scope. Now we add the augment इट् contrary and in opposition to the rule [[7.2.67]]. and this is the irregularity. As उप + ई + इ + इट् + क्वसु. Then the root य is replaced by च by <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.81]]. As उप + ई + य + इट् + क्वसु = उपेयिवस् 1st. sing. उपेयिवान्. The augment इट् is however dropped in those cases (भ) where वस्, is changed into उप्; because the insertion of इट् was itself an exceptional case of limited scope:-  for while the general rules [[7.2.75]] &c. ordained it, the special rule of [[7.2.67]] prohibited it; and it was by prohibition of this prohibition that इट् was employed before वस्. Therefore in accusative plural we have उपेयुषः; instrumental sing उपेयुषा &c.\n\nThis irregular participle is not limited to the <i>upasarga</i> उप; we find such irregular forms with other <i>upasargas</i> and without them also; thus समीयिवान्, and ईयिवान् as well.\n\nBy the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word वा read in this aphorism, we have लुङ् &c. in the alternative. As in Aorist उपागात्, Imperfect उपैत्, Perfect उपेयाव ।\n\nThe word अनाश्वान् is thus formed:- To the verb अश् 'to enjoy' we add the negative particle अन; apply the affix क्वसु and do not insert the augment इट्; So, we have अन + अश् + क्वसु = अनाश्वस् 1st. sing. अनाश्वान्. In the alternative we have Aorist नाशीत्, Imperfect नाश्नात् and Perfect नाश.\n\nThe word अनूचानः is thus derived:- The affix कामच् is added in expressing the agent to the verb वच् preceded by अनु. In the alternative we have Aorist अन्ववोचत्, Imperfect अन्वब्रवीत्, Perfect अनूवाच.",
    "32110": "The लुङ् forms what is known as aorist. It is in fact the name of the aorist, as the whole of this affix is replaced by other personal terminations. See [[3.1.43]] and subsequent <i>sutras</i>.\n\nThe aorist has reference to a past time indefinitely or generally, without reference to any particular time. An action done before today is expressed by the perfect or imperfect; whatever remains for the aorist is, therefore, to express a past action, done very recently, say, in the course of the current day or having reference to a present act. Aorist, therefore, merely implies the completion of an action at a past time generally, and also an action done at a very recent time, as during the course of this day. The imperfect and perfect are used in narrating events of past occurrence, generally in remote past time; the aorist is used in dialogues and conversations which refer to recent past actions, but it is not used to denote past specified time or to narrate events.-- <i>Apte</i>'s Composition. As अकार्षीत् 'he did'; अहार्षीत् 'he took'.\n\nVart:- The affix लुङ् comes after the verb वस् 'to dwell', when 'end of the present night' is indicated. Supposing a person rising from his bed at the proper time of rising (not in the middle of the night, but in the early morning) and finding another near him were to ask that one, 'where did you dwell i.e. pass the night'? That person so asked should answer in the लुङ् and not in लङ्. As अमुत्रावास्सम् 'I dwelt there'; and not अमुत्रावसम्.\n\nVart:- The above rule applies only in connection with waking after regular sleep. He who has not slept the whole night, but only for half an hour or so, should reply अमुत्रावसम्.",
    "32111": "The word अनद्यतन is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, meaning that which has not occurred during the course of the current day (<i>adyatana</i>). The whole of this affix is replaced by conjugational terminations, and the affix लङ् by itself denotes the Imperfect tense. As अकरोत् 'he did'; अहरत् 'he took'.\n\nWhy have we explained <i>anadyatana</i> as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound? Because when there is a doubt as to the time, whether it was to-day or yesterday, there the Imperfect should not be used. As अद्य ह्यो वा अभुञ्ज्महि 'we ate to-day or yesterday'. In such a case the affix is लुङ्.\n\nVart:- The affix लङ् is also employed in signifying what is not witnessed by the narrator, when it relates to a well-known public event which can form the object of perception by the narrator. Thus in speaking of a recent public occurrence we may say :-अरुणद् यवनः साकेतम् 'the <i>Yavanas</i> have besieged <i>Saketa</i>'; अरुणद् यवनः माध्यमिकान् 'the <i>Yavanas</i> have besieged <i>Madhyamika</i>'.\n\nWhy do we say 'not witnessed by the speaker'? Observe उदगात् आदित्यः 'the sun arose'. Why do we say 'a popular public event' ? Observe चकार कट देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> has made the mat'. Why do we say 'which is the object of perception by the speaker'? Observe जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः '<i>Vasudeva</i> killed <i>Kansa</i>'.",
    "32112": "The word अभिज्ञा means 'recollection'. This rule sets aside the affix लङ्. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामः 'rememberest thou, <i>Devadatta</i>, we were dwelling (lit. we will dwell) in <i>Kashmir</i>'.\n\nThe word वचन meaning 'signification' in the <i>sutra</i>, denotes that the construction is the same when the synonyms of अभिज्ञा are used; as स्मरसि 'dost thou remember'; बुध्यसे 'dost thou know'; चेतयसे 'dost thou reflect'; and the like.",
    "32113": "This prohibits लृट् which the verb वस् obtained from the last <i>sutra</i>. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेष्ववसाम 'thou rememberest <i>Devadatta</i> how we did dwell in <i>Kashmir</i>'. Here the mere fact of dwelling is recollected, there being no other idea implied; therefore the subsequent aphorism has no scope here. That aphorism has its scope, when with recollection, is added another dependent idea or action, without which the sentence is not complete.",
    "32114": "The word साकाङ्क्षा means the relation between the sign and the thing signified, wished for or wanted by the speaker, or in other words, when the first verb is related to another verb used in the same sentence, as a sign is to that which is indicated by the sign. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः, तत्र सक्तून् पास्यामः or अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गच्छामः, तत्र सक्तून् पिबामः 'do you remember <i>Devadatta</i> we went to Kashmir and there did drink <i>Saktu</i>'.\n\nThis option is allowed whether the particle यत् is or is not used. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः यत् कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः (or यत् कश्मीरान् गच्छाम,) यत् तत्रौदनं भोक्ष्यामहे (or यत् तत्रौदनमभुञ्ज्महि) 'Do you recollect, <i>Devadatta</i> how we went to <i>Kashmir</i> and how we ate rice there'.\n\nIn the above examples, the verb 'to go' is the sign, and the 'eating' or 'drinking', in the second sentence, is the thing really signified; the first verb is necessary as an introduction to the thought of the speaker which dwells more upon the second verb. Here the second sentence or proposition is used as completion or complement of the first proposition.",
    "32115": "The word परोक्ष 'unperceived' qualifies the words भूत 'past' and अनद्यतन 'non-current day' understood in this aphorism.\n\nWell, are not the senses of verbs all unperceived, since they are mere words, and words cannot be perceived ? Exactly so; but in popular phraseology, the perception is imagined to attach to the agent with regard to certain verbs; this rule relates to cases where such perception does not take place. As, चकार 'he did'; जहार 'he took'.\n\nIt is evident that the लिट् (perfect) should not be used in the first person, i. e. when the agent of the action is the speaker or writer himself; for it is impossible that the action should not have been witnessed by him. But if by reason of some distracted, unconscious or absent state of mind, it is possible for the agent to speak of the action as one, of which he was not a conscious witness, the perfect may be used even in the first person. As सुप्तोऽहं किल विललाप 'indeed I prated while asleep'.\n\nVart:- The perfect should be employed (in denoting past time simply, whether of the current day or otherwise, and whether the action has been witnessed personally or not) if the sense is total denial of the action. As कलिङ्गेषु स्थितोऽसि ? नाहं कलिङ्गम् जगाम 'did you live in the <i>Kalinga</i> country ? I did not even go to the <i>Kalinga</i> country'; दक्षिणापथं प्रविष्टोऽसि ? नाहं दक्षिणापथं प्रविवेश.",
    "32116": "The force of च 'and' is that the affix लिट् (perfect) may also be employed in similar construction. As इति हाकरोत् (imperfect), or इति ह चकार (perfect) 'Alas ! he did it'. शश्वदकरोत् or शश्वच्चकार 'again and again he did it'.",
    "32117": "This <i>sutra</i> also qualifies the words भूत, अनद्यतन and परोक्ष understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The word प्रश्न means 'what should be asked'; and आसन्नकाल 'time close at hand': As, some one may ask another, अगच्छत् देवदत्तः, or जगाम देवदत्तः 'did <i>Devadatta</i> go or has <i>Devadatta</i> gone (just now)'? अयजद् देवदत्तः or इयाज देवदत्तः 'Did <i>Devadatta</i> sacrifice or has <i>Devadatta</i> sacrificed'?\n\nWhy do we say 'in asking question'? Otherwise there would be Perfect tense only. As, जगाम देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> has gone'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the past time referred to is imminently recent'? Observe भवन्तं पृच्छामि, जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः 'I ask you, did <i>Krishna</i> indeed kill <i>Kansa</i> in days of yore'.",
    "32118": "All the words within brackets are understood in this aphorism. This debars लिट् or the perfect tense. Thus यजति स्म युधिष्ठिरः '<i>Yudhishthira</i> sacrificed'; so also नलेन स्म पुराधीयते । उर्णया स्म पराधीयते ॥",
    "32119": "As एवं स्म पिता ब्रवीति 'thus said the father'; इति स्मोपाध्यायः कथयति 'thus said the preceptor'.",
    "32120": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words '<i>anadyatana</i>' and '<i>paroksha</i>' does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. This declares a rule with regard to past time in general. This debars लुङ् (the Aorist tense). As अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त ? -- ननु करोमि भोः '<i>Devadatta</i>, did you make the mat? O, yes, I did make it'. अवोचस्तत्र किञ्चिद् देवदत्त,- - ननु ब्रवीमि भोः '<i>Devadatta</i>, did you speak there anything? O, yes, I did speak'.\n\nWhy do we say 'in reply to an interrogation'? Observe नन्वकार्षीन्  माणवकः 'certainly, <i>Manavaka</i> did it'.",
    "32121": "As, अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त -- न करोमि भोः or नाकार्षम्; -- अहं नु करोमि or अहं न्वकार्षम् '<i>Devadatta</i>, did you make the mat ? -- No I did not; --  what of that, I did'.",
    "32122": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>anadyatana</i> which had come to a stop with [[3.2.120]] manifests itself again in this <i>sutra</i> by a process of jumping over the two intermediate aphorisms. This sort of <i>anuvritti</i> is technically called <i>manduka</i>-<i>pluti</i> 'the leap of a frog' i. e. skipping of several <i>sutras</i> and supplying a word from a previous <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThis is an optional rule, so that when <i>lat</i> and <i>lun</i> are not used, the proper tenses, as the case may be, must be employed. As वसन्तीह पुरा छात्राः 'the pupils lived here formerly'. So also, Aorist, अवात्सुः पुरा छात्राः; Imperfect, अवसन्निह पुरा छात्राः; Perfect, ऊषुरिह पुरा छात्राः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word स्म is not used'? Observe यजति स्म पुरा युधिष्टिरः '<i>Yudhishthira</i> did perform a sacrifice formerly'. Here rule 118 <i>ante</i> exerts its influence.",
    "32123": "The word वर्तमान means that which is begun and which has not yet come to an end. The action denoted by a verb in the present tense is yet continuing and has not stopped. As पचति 'he is cooking'; पठति 'he is reading'. So also whatever is constant, regular, uniform, is represented by the Present Indefinite. As तिष्ठन्ति पर्वताः 'the mountains stand'; स्रवन्ति नद्यः 'the rivers flow'.",
    "32124": "As पचमानं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold <i>Devadatta</i> who is cooking'; पचता कृतम् or पचमानेन कृतम् 'done by one who is cooking'. पच् + शानच् = पच् + शप् + शानच् [[3.4.113]], [[3.1.68]] = पच् + अ + मुक् + आन [[7.2.82]] = पचमान । So also पच् + शप् + शतृ = पच् + अ + अत् = पचत् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when agreeing with what does not end with the first case-affix' ? Observe देवदत्तः पचति '<i>Devadatta</i> cooks'.\n\nSince the term लट् might have been supplied from the last aphorism, its double citation is for the sake of larger application of this rule; that is to say, this rule applies sometimes even when the word is in concord with a nominative case. As सन् ब्राह्मणः 'who is a <i>Brahmana</i>' = अस्ति ब्राह्मणः; so also विद्यते ब्राह्मणः and विद्यमानो ब्राह्मणः; जुहुत् and जुहोति; and अधीयानः and अधीते ।\n\nVart:- These affixes are employed after a verb, when the particle माङ् is in composition, and censure or curse is implied. As मा पचन् and मा पचमानः 'may he not cook'; मा जीवन् यः परावज्ञादुःखदग्धोऽपि जीवति  'cursed be he (lit. may he not live) who though smitten by the pain of the contempt of others, still lives'. Some commentators read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'option' from <i>sutra</i> 121 into this. That option, however, is a limited option (<i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>) and not of universal application. Whenever a particular form is found as differing from the general form, there it should be understood that the option has been allowed, and not everywhere.",
    "32125": "This aphorism declares when these participles may be employed even in the first case; as हे पचन् or हे पचमान 'O thou who art cooking'.",
    "32126": "The word लक्षण means that by which a thing is recognised or known i. e. an attribute; हेतु means producer or cause. Both these words are attributes of the word क्रिया. Of <i>lakshana</i>:- as, शयानाः भुञ्जते यवनाः 'the <i>Yavanas</i> take their meals lying down'. तिष्ठन्तोऽनुशासति गणकाः । Of <i>hetu</i> :- as हरिं पश्यन् मुच्यते 'by (reason of) seeing <i>Hari</i>, he gets absolution'; अधीयानो वसति 'for the sake of study he dwells here'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting a characteristic or a cause'? Observe पचति 'he cooks'; पठति 'he reads'.\n\nWhy do we say 'of the action'? Not so when the participle is the characteristic or cause of a substance or a quality. As यः कम्पते सोऽश्वत्थः 'that which is shaking is the <i>Aswattha</i>'; यदुत्प्लवते तल्लभु 'whatever floats is light'; यन्निषीदति तद्गुरु 'that which sinks down is heavy'.\n\nVart:- This participle also defines the agent of an action as, योऽधीयान आस्ते स देवदत्तः 'he is <i>Devadatta</i> who sits studying'.\n\nVart:- This participle is also used to state a general truth: as शयाना वर्धते दूर्वा 'the <i>Durva</i> grass grows in a recumbent position'; आसीनं वर्धते बिसं 'a lotus stalk grows in an upright position'. The compound लक्षणहेत्वोः of the <i>sutra</i> contradicts the rule by which a word of fewer syllables stands first [[2.2.14]]. This shows that the rule (II. 2. 14.) is not universal.",
    "32127": "These participial affixes get collectively this name; and as such they are not limited by the conditions enumerated above; so that they replace not only the affixes of the Present tense but sometimes of Future also (III. 3. 14.), as well as other tenses. Thus ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्, करिष्यन्, कुर्वाणः, करिष्यमाणः ।\n\nThe word सत् occurs in <i>sutra</i> (II. 2. 11.) &c.",
    "32128": "As पवमानः 'purifier (fire or air)'; यजमानः 'sacrificer'.\n\nIt might be asked 'is the शानन् with others that follow, an affix suo generis, or is it merely a substitute of ल, as शतृ and शानच् ? Why we ask this question is this. If they are affixes and not substitutes of ल, then they should govern genitive case by rule (II. 3. 65.) instead of nominative or the accusative. If, on the other hand, they are substitutes of ल, then by rule (II. 3. 69.) they should not govern the genitive case. But evidently they are not the substitutes of ल, as they are not so taught. How is it then that we have such forms as सोमं पवमानः 'drinking <i>Soma</i>'; and नडमाघ्नानः? These forms can be explained on other grounds than supposing that शानन् &c. must be the substitutes of ल. The term तृन् in <i>sutra</i> (II 3. 69.) is not the affix तृन् taught in this Chapter <i>sutra</i> 135; but it is a <i>pratyahara</i> including several affixes. It is a <i>pratyahara</i> formed by taking the तृ of शतृ in <i>sutra</i> 124; and न् of तृन् in 135; and thus it means all the affixes from शतृ in 134 down to तृन् in 135. Thus though शानन्, चानश् &c. are not substitutes of ल, still the rule (II. 3. 69.) applies to them, as they are included in the term तृन्.\n\nVart:- The rule (II. 3. 69.) applies only optionally when the verb द्विष् takes the affix शतृ. As चोरस्य or चोरं द्विषन् 'hating the thief'.",
    "32129": "The word ताच्छील्य means 'habit' or 'disposition'; वयः means the condition of body such as 'infancy', 'youth' & c; शक्ति means 'capacity to do a thing'. As भोगं भुञ्जानः 'habituated to enjoy'; कवचं बिभ्राणः 'wearing an armour (of the age at which armour may be worn)'; शत्रुं निघ्नानः 'able to destroy his foe'. So also, कतीह मुण्डयमानाः, भूषयमानाः, कवचं पर्यस्यमानाः, शिखण्डं वहमानाः and पचमानाः।",
    "32130": "The word अकृच्छ्र means that which is accomplished by the agent with ease and facility. As अधीयन् पारायणम् 'the facile reading of the <i>Purana</i>'; धारयन्नुपनिषदम् 'easily mastering the <i>Upanishad</i>'. The root धारि is causative of धृ and means here 'to master'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when facility is indicated'? Otherwise कृच्छ्रेणाधीते 'he reads with difficulty'; कृच्छ्रेण धारयति 'he remembers with difficulty'.",
    "32131": "The word अमित्र means 'enemy'. As द्विषन् 'enemy', द्विषन्तौ 'two enemies', द्विषन्तः 'enemies'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an enemy'? Observe द्वेष्टि भार्या पतिम् 'the wife hates her husband'.",
    "32132": "The word यज्ञसंयोग is an instrumental compound, meaning association or connection (संयोग) with sacrifice. As सु + नु + शतृ (III. I. 76), [[3.4.113]] = सुनु+ अत् (I. 2. 4.) = सुन्वत् (VI. I. 77), Ist. sing. सुन्वन्, Ist. pl. सुन्वन्तः 'the sacrificers'; as in सर्वे सुन्वन्तः 'all are interested in, or partake of, or share in the sacrifice'.\n\nThe word संयोग indicates that the principal sacrificer. i.e. the यजमान is meant and not every person who is associated in the performance of a sacrifice in a subordinate capacity; such as याजकाः 'the sacrificing priests'.\n\nWhen connection with sacrifice is not meant we have the सुनोति सुराम् 'he distils liquor'.",
    "32133": "As अर्हन्निह भवान्विद्याम् 'thou art worthy of this knowledge here'; अर्हन्निह भवान्पूजाम् 'thou art worthy of honor in this place'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to praise' ? Witness अर्हति चौरो वधम् 'the thief deserves death'.",
    "32134": "The force of आ in this <i>sutra</i> is limit inclusive, and includes क्विप् also. The term तच्छील means 'the natural inclination towards an action not prompted by a contemplation of its fruit or result'. The term तद्धर्म means 'who enters upon an action not from habit but thinking that it is his duty'. The term तत्साधुकारि means 'who does the action expressed by the verb in an excellent way'. Illustrations of these will be given under the subsequent aphorisms.",
    "32135": "The न् of तृन् is indicatory, and regulates the accent [[6.1.197]]. As कृ + तृन् = कर्तृ, Ist sing. कर्ता. This affix denotes habit in the following; as, कर्ता कटान् 'who is accustomed to make mats'. Nature:- as, मुण्डयितारः श्राविष्ठायना भवति वधूमूढाम् 'the family of <i>Sravishtayana</i> shave the heads of their widows'; अन्नमपहर्तार आह्वरका भवन्ति श्राद्धे सिद्धे 'the <i>Ahvarakas</i> steal away food as soon as <i>Sraddha</i> is accomplished'; उन्नेतारस्तौल्वलायना भवन्ति पुत्रे जाते 'the <i>Taulvalayanas</i> become elated on the birth of a son'. Skill:- as, कर्त्ता कटम् 'skilful maker of mats'. गन्ताऽऽखेटम् 'skilful hunter'.\n\nVart:- The simple verbs, without <i>upasargas</i>, take the affix तृन्, when the words so formed are names of sacrificial priests. As हु + तृन् = होतृ, Ist. sing. होता 'the <i>Hotri</i> priest'; so also पोतृ 'the <i>Potri</i> priest'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not taking the <i>upasargas</i>'? Observe उद्गातृ 'the <i>Udgatri</i> priest'; प्रतिहर्तृ 'the <i>Pratihartri</i> priest'. Here the affix is तृच्. Though the form is the same, there is difference however in the accent; i.e. तृन् places <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable (VI. I. 197), while तृच् places it on the last [[6.1.163]].\n\nVart:- The augment षुक् is added when नी takes the affix तृन्; as नी + षुक् + तृन् = नेष्टृ, Ist. sing. नेष्टा 'the <i>Neshtri</i> priest'.\n\nVart:- When signifying diety, the verb त्विष् takes तृन्; the letter अ is the substitute for the इ of the root; and the affix does not take the intermediate इट् augment; as, त्विष् + तृन् = त्वष्टृ, Ist. sing. त्वष्टा '<i>Tvashtri</i>'.\n\nVart:- The root क्षद takes तृन्, when the word to be formed means an officer; as क्षतृ 'an attendant, a door-keeper'.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Veda</i>, the root क्षद takes तृच्, as क्षतृ. The form is the same as the last, but there is difference of accent.",
    "32136": "As अलङ्करिष्णुः 'decorating', निराकरिष्णुः 'repudiating', प्रजमिष्णुः 'procreative', उत्पचिष्णुः 'apt to ripen', उत्पतिष्णुः 'flying', उन्मदिष्णुः 'mad', रोचिष्णुः 'bright', अपत्रपिष्णुः 'bashful', वर्त्तिष्णुः 'revolving', वर्द्धिष्णुः 'growing', सहिष्णुः 'patient', चरिष्णुः 'moveable'.\n\nVart:-The affix इष्णुच् debares by anticipation the affix युच् [[3.2.151]], after the root अलङ्कृ, though it has the sense of decorating'.",
    "32137": "The Causatives take this affix in the Vedic literature. As दृषदं धारयिष्णवः 'who hold the stones'; वीरुधः पारयिष्णवः ।",
    "32138": "Thus भविष्णुः 'becoming'.\n\nThe <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> or the division of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, with which it could well have been read, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>.\n\nThe word 'also' indicates the existence of other verbs not included in the above two <i>sutras</i>; as, भ्राजिष्णुना लोहितचन्दनेन ।",
    "32139": "As, ग्लास्नुः 'languid'; जिष्णुः 'victorious'; स्थास्नुः 'disposed to stand firm, immoveable'; भूष्णुः 'being'.\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>Chhandasi</i> does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. The indicatory letter of this affix is really ग and not क, and therefore, there is no substitution of long ई for the आ of स्था, which would otherwise have taken place, had the affix been कित् [[6.4.66]].\n\nIn the <i>sutra</i> (l. 1. 5.) (क्ङिति च) the letter ग is also included; for ग coming before क, is changed by the rules of <i>sandhi</i> into क and is not therefore visible. This affix therefore does not cause <i>guna</i>.\n\nSo also in <i>sutra</i> (VII. 2. II) (श्रयुकः किति), the augment इट् does not come after the verb स्नु, or a monosyllabic verb ending in the <i>pratyahara</i> उक, when an affix having an indicatory क follows. Here also क includes ग; and therefore in भूष्णु we have no intermediate augment इट्.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> this affix comes after the verb दंश 'to bite'; as दङ्क्ष्णवः पशवः 'the beasts that bite'.",
    "32140": "As, त्रस्नुः 'trembling'; गृध्नुः 'greedy'; धृष्णुः 'bold'; and क्षिण्नुः 'throwing'.",
    "32141": "The word इति in the aphorism indicates beginning. These eight verbs begin with शम् and end with मद in the list of verbs. Of the affix घिनुण् the real affix is इन्, the other letters are servile; the घ is for the sake of substituting guttural for the final palatals; उ is for the sake of euphony, or for the sake of rule [[6.3.45]]; and the letter ण् causes <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.116]]: which in the case of roots ending in म is prohibited by the rule [[7.3.34]], the only verb taking '<i>vriddhi</i>' being मद् ।\n\nAs शमिन् Ist. sing. शमी 'calm'; likewise तमी 'desiring'; दमी 'taming'; श्रमी 'laborious'; भ्रमी 'whirling', 'moving round'; क्लमी 'fatiguing'; क्षमी 'forbearing'; प्रमादी 'mad' and उन्मादी 'mad'. Though by rule 136, the verb उन्मद takes the affix इष्णुच्, it also takes the affix घिनुण् by the rule of वाऽमरूप [[3.1.94]].\n\nAll these verbs belong to the <i>Divadi</i> class. After other verbs than these eight, we have other affixes; as असिता.",
    "32142": "The root सम्पृच् is to be taken as belonging to the <i>Rudhadi</i> class, and not as belonging to <i>Adadi</i>, because the <i>vikarana</i> is elided in the latter. The root परिदेव belongs to <i>Bhvadi</i> class, the simple verb being देवृ 'to sport'. The verb क्षिप् 'to throw' is common both to <i>Tudadi</i> and <i>Divadi</i>, and both are taken here. युज् 'to concentrate' is <i>Divadi</i>, and युज् 'to join' is <i>Rudhadi</i>; both are meant here. The verb रञ्ज् 'to color' has lost its nasal in this <i>sutra</i>, irregularly.\n\nThus सम्पृच् + घिनुण् = सम्पर्क + इन् [[7.2.52]] = सम्पर्किन् Ist. sing. सम्पर्की 'mixture'; similarly, अनुरोधी 'compliant'; आयामी 'one who restrains'; आयासी 'one who exerts'; परिसारी 'that which flows round'; संसर्गी 'united'; परिदेवी 'lamenting'; संवारी 'greatly heating'; परिक्षेपी 'moving about'; परिराटी 'crying aloud'; परिवादी 'reviling'; परिवाही 'burning'; परिमोही 'beguiling'; दोषी 'guilty'; द्वेषी 'hating'; द्रोही 'quarrelling'; दोही 'milking'; योगी 'uniting or concentrating'; आक्रीडी 'playing'; विवेकी 'discriminating'; त्यागी 'renouncing'; रागी 'yearning after'; भागी 'sharing'; अतिचारी 'transgressing'; अपचारी 'offending'; आमोषी 'a thief'; अभ्याघाती 'attacking'. [[7.3.52]] and (54).\n\nThe indicatory घ of the affix shows that the final palatal is changed into a corresponding guttural before this affix.",
    "32143": "As विकाषी 'injuring'; विलासी 'sportive, a sensualist'; विकत्थी 'vaunting'; and विस्रम्भी 'confiding'.",
    "32144": "As अपलाषी 'thirsty'; विलाषी. The term वि is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> by the force of the word 'and'.",
    "32145": "As प्रलापी 'prattling'; प्रसारी 'extending around'; प्रद्रावी 'running away, fugitive'; प्रमाथी 'tormenting'; प्रवादी 'reporting'; प्रवासी 'a traveller'.\n \nThe root वस् here is the <i>Bhvadi</i> वस् meaning 'to dwell' and is not <i>Adadi</i> meaning 'to cover', because in the latter the <i>vikarana</i> is elided.",
    "32146": "In this <i>sutra</i> the whole phrase ending with असूय has taken the termination of the first case; which, however, has the force of the ablative here.\n\nAs निन्द् + वुञ् = निन्दकः (VII. I. I) 'blaming'; so also हिंसकः 'injuring'; क्लेशकः 'tormenting or troublesome'; खादकः 'eating'; विनाशकः 'destroying'; परिक्षेपकः 'surrounding'; परिराटकः 'who cries aloud'; परिवादकः 'a plaintiff'; व्याभाषकः 'detracting'; and असूयकः 'detracting'.\n\nThe same forms as the above would have been obtained by adding the affix ण्वुल taught in [[3.1.133]], as by adding वुञ्; its separate enunciation indicates the existence of this <i>paribhasha</i> :-\n\n\"The rule of [[3.1.94]] by which an <i>apavada</i>-affix which is not uniform with an <i>utsarga</i>-affix should supersede the latter only optionally, has no concern with <i>apavada</i>-affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit' i. e. with the affixes taught in (III. 2. 134-177)\". Therefore the affixes तृच् &c, are not added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'.",
    "32147": "As आदेवकः 'one who sports or laments'; आक्रोशकः 'vociferous, a reviler'; परिदेवकः 'one who laments'; परिक्रोशकः 'a reviler'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when in composition with an <i>upasarga</i>'? Observe देवयिता and क्रोष्ठा formed by तृन् [[3.2.135]].",
    "32148": "As, चल् + युच् = चलनः 'moving' (VII. I. 1); चोपनः 'creeping'; शब्दनः 'sounding'; रवणः 'roaring'.\n\nWhy do we say 'intransitive'? Observe पठिता विद्याम्.",
    "32149": "As वर्त्तनः 'being'; वर्द्धनः 'growing'.\n\nWhy do we say '<i>Anudattet</i>'? Observe भविता.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe एधिता, which though <i>Atmanepadi</i>, takes तृन्.\n\nWhy have we used the term आदि 'beginning' in the <i>sutra</i>? Observe जुगुप्सनः 'censuring'; मीमांसनः 'an investigator'. For without the word आदि, the rule would have stood thus:- अनुदात्तेतश्च हलः which by (I. I. 72.) would mean 'the affix युच् comes after the verbs which end with a consonant'; so that even after एध् we shall have युच्; and there would be no युच् after जुगुप्स which ends with a vowel.\n\nThis rule will not apply if the root is transitive; as वसिता वस्त्रं ।",
    "32150": "The verb जु is not to be found in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, and is taught in the aphorisms and is hence called a <i>sautra</i> <i>dhatu</i>. It means 'to go', 'to be quick'. As जु + युच् = जो +अन (VII. 1. 1.) and [[7.3.84]] = जवनः (VI. I. 78), [[2.3.46]] 'a courser, a swift horse'. चङ्क्रम्य + युच् = चङ्क्रम् + अन् [[2.4.74]] = चङ्क्रमनः 'moving about'; so also दन्द्रमणः 'wandering'; सरणः 'flowing'; गर्द्धनः 'greedy'; ज्वलनः 'burning'; शोचनः 'grieving'; लषणः 'desiring'; पतनः 'falling'; पदनः 'moving'.\n\nThe enumeration of the word पद in the above, indicates that this <i>sutra</i> applies to the transitive verbs; otherwise the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.148]] would have been sufficient, as पद is a चलनार्थ verb. Others say that the inclusion of पद् in this aphorism indicates the existence of the <i>paribhasha</i> already given under <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.146]] i.e. the rule of [[3.1.94]] has no concern with affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'. The affix इष्णुच् which by [[3.2.136]] is added to अलङ्कृतम्, supersedes therefore not merely the addition of तृन् to अलङ्कृतम् [[3.2.135]], but also the addition of ण्वुल् to the same. If a <i>tachchhilika</i> <i>apavada</i> were to supersede only an <i>atachchhilika</i> <i>utsarga</i>, it would have been superfluous for <i>Panini</i> to teach in this <i>sutra</i> the addition of युच् to पद्, because in that case the addition of युच् to पद् by [[3.2.154]] would not have debarred the addition of युच् to पद् by [[3.2.149]]. The repetition is for the sake of <i>jnapana</i>, therefore, and it indicates the existence of the above-mentioned maxim. The <i>jnapaka</i> is not, however, of universal application; for sometimes both affixes are applied concurrently; as, गन्ता खेटं विकत्थनः ।",
    "32151": "As क्रोधनः 'wrathful'; रोषणः 'irascible'; मण्डनः 'adorning'; भूषणः 'ornament'. But not so after the verb अलङ्कृ to which <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.136]] applies.",
    "32152": "This debars [[3.2.149]]. As क्नूयिता 'making creaking sound'; क्षमायिता 'trembling'. In these cases the affix तृन् is employed [[3.2.135]].",
    "32153": "These three verbs are <i>anudattet</i>, and by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.149]], would have taken युच्. The present <i>sutra</i> prohibits that. Therefore they take तृन्. As, सूदितृ Ist. sing सूदिता 'one who strikes'; दीपितृ 'one who shines'; दीक्षितृ 'one who initiates'.\n\nNow, it might be objected-- \"We find that <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.167]] specifically enjoins the affix र after दीप्; this <i>apavada</i> rule will therefore, supersede the general rule; where is then the necessity of the present rule? If you say that the affix युच् is also obtained by the rule of non-uniformity [[3.1.94]], we reply that the <i>Paribhasha</i> given under <i>sutra</i> 146 and 150 will prevent that.\" This objection is answered by saying that the above-mentioned <i>Paribhasha</i> is not of universal application; there are exceptions to it, as कम्रा युवतिः and क्रमना युवतिः 'a young girl' which are both valid forms derived by adding र and युच् to the verb कम्. So also कम्प्रा and कम्पना शाखा 'a shaking branch'.\n \nIf we prohibit युच् after the root सूद, how do we get the forms मधुसूदन and रिपुसूदन ? This objection may be answered in three ways: (1) the present is an <i>anitya</i> rule, not of universal application, which can be inferred from finding this <i>sutra</i> separated from the last (<i>yogavibhaga</i>), when it was easier to make them one, (2) the words मधुसूदन &c belong to the मन्दादि class (III. I. 134) taking the affix ल्यु or (3) they are formed by [[3.3.113]] by the affix ल्युट्.",
    "32154": "As अपलाषुकं वृषलसङ्गतं, प्रपातुका गर्भा भवन्ति, उपपादुकंसत्वं, उपस्थायुका एनं पशवो भवन्ति, प्रभावुकमन्नं भवति, प्रवर्षुकाः पर्जन्याः, आघातुकं कापालिकस्य शूलम्, कामुकं एनं स्त्रियो भवन्ति, आगामुकं वाराणसीं रक्ष आहुः, किंशारुकं तीक्ष्णमाहुः । The य is added after स्था in उपस्थायुक by [[7.3.33]]. The हन् is changed into घात् by [[7.3.32]] and (54).",
    "32155": "The ष is indicatory showing that the feminine of the words so formed take the affix ङीष् i. e. long ई [[4.1.41]]. As जल्पाकः 'talkative'; भिक्षाकः 'a beggar'; कुट्टाकः 'who or what cuts'; लुण्टाकः 'a thief or robber'; वराकः 'low, miserable'. In the feminine जल्पाकी &c.",
    "32156": "As प्रजविन्, Ist. sing. प्रजवी 'an express, courier', Ist. dual प्रजविनौ &c.",

    "32158": "The word निद्रा is formed by adding the preposition नि to the verb द्रा 'to go crookedly'; so also तन्द्रा is formed by adding तद् to द्रा, and then irregularly changing the द् into न्. The term श्रद्धा is formed by adding श्रत् to the verb डुधाञ् 'to hold'. The first three verbs belong to <i>Churadi</i> class and take णिच्.\n\nAs, स्पृहयालुः 'disposed to be desirous of'; गृहयालुः 'disposed to catch hold of or seize'; पतयालुः 'tending or prone to fall'; दयालुः 'compassionate'; निद्रालुः 'disposed to sleep'; तन्द्रालुः 'slothful'; श्रद्धालुः 'full of faith'. See [[6.4.55]] for adding अय ।\n\nVart:- The affix आलुच् comes also after the root शीङ् 'to lie down'; as शयालुः 'disposed to lie down'.",
    "32159": "As, दारुः 'munificent man'; धारुर्वत्सो मातरम् 'a sucking child of the mother'. The genitive case is here prohibited by [[2.3.69]], the रु being taken as equivalent to उ. As सरुः 'binding'; शद्रुः 'falling'; and सद्रुः 'resting'.",
    "32160": "As सृमरः 'going, a kind of deer'; घस्मरः 'gluttonous'; अद्मरः 'voracious'.",
    "32161": "As भञ्ज् + घुरच् = भङ्ग् + डर [[7.3.52]] = भङ्गुरः 'brittle'; the palatal being changed into guttural, because of the indicatory घ. So also मेदुरः पशुः 'a fat beast'; भासुरं ज्योतिः 'splendid light'.\n\nAfter the verb भञ्ज् this affix gives a reflexive signification-- that which naturally breaks of itself.",
    "32162": "As विदुरः पण्डितः 'a knowing <i>Pandit</i>'; भिदुरं काष्टम् 'a splitting or fragile wood'; छिदुरा रज्जुः 'a cutting or breaking rope'. The affix is employed in a reflexive sense after the verbs भिद and छिद.\n\nVart:- The affix कुरच् comes after the verb व्यध 'to kill'; and there is vocalisation of the semivowel; as विधुरः ।",
    "32163": "The प् is indicatory in order to introduce the augment तुक् between the verb and the affix (VI. I. 71). Thus इ + क्वरप् = इ + त् + वर = इत्वरः, fem. इत्वरी 'a traveller'; नश्वरः, fem. नश्वरी 'transitory'; जित्वरः, fem. जित्वरी 'victorious'; सृत्वरः fem. सृत्वरी 'going, a river'.\n\nThough the affix begins with a letter of वल् <i>pratyahara</i>, and ought to have taken the intermediate इट् [[7.2.35]] yet it is prohibited by [[7.2.8]].",
    "32164": "The word गत्वर is formed by eliding the म् of गम् and adding the affix क्वरप्. As गत्वरः, fem. गत्वरी 'locomotive, transient'.",
    "32165": "As जागरूकः 'wakeful'.",
    "32166": "The intensives of these verbs take ऊक. As यायजूकः 'a performer of frequent sacrifices'; जञ्जपूकः 'a mutterer of prayers repeatedly'; दन्दशूकः 'a snake (what bites frequently)'.",
    "32167": "Thus, नम्रं काष्ठं 'soft wood'; कम्प्रा शाखा 'shaking branch'; स्मेरं मुखं 'smiling face'; अशस्त्रं जुहोति 'he sacrifices perpetually'; कम्रा युवती 'a beautiful maiden'; हिंस्रं रक्षः 'the injuring <i>Rakshas</i>'; दीप्रं काष्ठं 'brilliant wood'.\n\nThe word अजस्रं is an adverb, and is derived from the root जस् 'to set free', with the negative particle अ, and the affix र; as अ + जस् + र = अजस्रं ।",
    "32168": "The term सन् in the aphorism means Desideratives in the affix सन्, and not the verb, सन् because the verb सन् is never seen with this affix.\n\nAs, चिकीर्षुः 'desirous of doing'; जिहीर्षुः 'desirous of taking'; आशंसुः 'desirous'; भिक्षुः 'a beggar'.\n\nThe verb आशंस् with the <i>upasarga</i> आ is the verb शसि 'to desire' and not the verb शंसि 'to praise'.",
    "32169": "To the verb विदि we add the augment नुम् and then the affix उ; as, विद् + नुम् + उ = विन्दुः (I. I. 47) वेदनशीलः 'intelligent'; so of इष् 'to wish', the ष is replaced by छ, and we have इच्छुः = एषणशीलः 'desirous'.",
    "32170": "The affix उ comes in the <i>Chhandas</i>, after the roots that have taken the Denominative affix क्य in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit &c'.\n\nThe term क्य includes the three affixes क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यप् (see <i>sutras</i> (III. I. 8), (II. 13), &c). As मित्रयुः, संस्वेदयुः, सुम्नयुः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. I. 3. 4).\n\nIn the modern Sanskrit तृन् will be employed. As मित्रीयिता. By <i>sutra</i> [[7.4.33]], the long ई replaces the final अ, when क्यच् follows; as पुत्र + क्यच् =  पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय. Why then in the case of मित्रयुः there is not the substitution of long ई for the अ of मित्र ? Because the rule [[7.4.33]] is set aside by [[7.4.35]] which declares that in the <i>Chhandas</i> the long ई is not substituted for the अ ।",
    "32171": "The द् after आ is either for the sake of euphony, or for the sake of precision. Had it been त्, then by the rule of तपर [[1.1.70]] short ऋ would only be included and not long ॠ. But the present rule is applicable to long ॠ as well.\n\nThus पा + कि = पपिः 'drinking'; as पपिः सोमं  'drinking the <i>soma</i>-juice'; ददिर्गाः 'giving cows' (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. VI. 23. 4). मित्रावरुणौ ततुरिः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. IV. 39. 2, VI. 68. 7). दूरे अध्वाजगुरिः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. X. 108. I). गम् + किन् = जग्मिः 'being in constant motion, wind'; जग्मियुवा (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. II. 23. 11); हन् + किन् = जघ्निः 'killing, a weapon offensive'; जघ्निवृत्रम् (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. IX. 61. 2); जन् + किन् = जघ्निः as जज्ञिबीजम् (T.S. VII. 5. 20. I).\n\nThe letter क् in these affixes is indicatory. It might be said 'it is superfluous to make these affixes कित्, because these being treated like लिट् will be कित् by rule (1. 2. 5)'. True, they would be कित् by the rule [[1.2.5]], but then the rule [[7.4.11]]. (when <i>lit</i> follows, <i>guna</i> is the substitute of the verb ॠच्छ and of those that end in the long ॠ) would also have applied to these affixes, and would have caused <i>guna</i>. It is to prevent this <i>guna</i> of the letter ॠ that we have annexed an indicatory क to these affixes.\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् are of universal application in the <i>Chhandas</i>, and not confined to the verbs enumerated in the <i>sutra</i>, as we see them in सद् &c.; as सेदिः (<i>Yaj</i>. <i>Ved</i>. XII. 105); नेमिः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. II. 5. 3).\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् come after the roots धाञ्, कृञ्, सृ, जमि, गमि, and नमि in the secular literature also; as, दधिः, चक्रिः, सस्रिः, जज्ञिः, जग्मिः ,नेमिः ।\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् come after the Intensive (यङन्त) roots of सह्, यह्, चल् and यत्. As, सासहिः, वावहिः, चाचलिः, यायतिः [[7.4.83]].",
    "32172": "The affix नजिङ् comes, in the sense of 'the agents having such a habit &c', after the verbs स्वप् 'to sleep' and तृष 'to be thirsty'.\n\nAs स्वप् + नजिङ् = स्वप्नज् Ist. sing. स्वप्नक् 'sleeping, drowsy'; तृष्णज् Ist. sing. तृष्णक् 'covetous, thirsty'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verb धृष् 'to insult, be bold'; as, धृष्णज् Ist. sing. धृष्णक् 'bold, impudent'.",
    "32173": "As शरारुः 'noxious, a mischievous animal'; वन्दारुः 'praising, a bard'.",
    "32174": "As, भीरुः 'fearful, timid'; भीलुकः 'timorous, a bear, a tiger, a jackal'.\nVart:- The affix क्रुकन् should also be stated; as भीरुकः ।",
    "32175": "As स्थावरः 'immoveable'; ईश्वरः 'ruler, God'; पेस्वरः 'going, destructive'; विकस्वरः 'opening, expanding'.",
    "32176": "With the affix यङ्, the intensives of verbs are formed; as यायावरः 'a vagrant, an ascetic'. See <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.58]].",
    "32177": "Thus, विभ्राज् Ist. sing. विभ्राट् 'splendid'; भास् Ist. sing. भाः 'light'; धुर्व् + क्विप् = धुर् [[6.4.21]], Ist sing. धूः 'who injures'; विद्युत् 'lightening'; ऊर्ज Ist. sing. कर्क् 'strength'; पुर् Ist. sing. पूः 'what fills'; जूः 'swift'. In the case of जु, a long vowel is the substitute of जु; ग्रावस्तुत् (VI. I. 71) 'a stone-worshipper'. Though by the universal rule [[3.2.76]], the affix क्विप् would have come after these verbs also, the repetition of the affix shows that वाऽसरूपविधि does not apply in <i>tachchhilika</i> affixes.",
    "32178": "As युज्, Ist. sing. युक् 'joining'; छित् 'piercing'; भित् 'dividing'.\n\nBy using the words 'is seen' in the aphorism, it is implied that other rules also apply concurrently with क्विप्. Thus in some cases we find lengthening of the vowel; in some, there is reduplication of the root; in some instances there is <i>samprasarana</i> of the semivowel; and in other cases there is not.\n\nVart:- When क्विप् follows, the long vowel is the substitute of वच् 'to speak', प्रच्छ् 'to ask', आयतस्तु 'to praise long', कटप्रु 'to move through a mat', जु 'to move rapidly', and श्री 'to serve', and there is no substitution of a vowel for the semivowel [[6.1.16]].\n\nAs, वाक् 'the voice'; प्रच्छ् + क्विप् = प्रश् + क्विप् [[6.1.10]] = प्रष् + क्विप् [[8.2.36]] = प्राट् [[8.4.56]] 'who asks'; आयतस्तूः 'who praises long'; कटप्रूः 'a worm'; जूः 'swift'; श्रीः 'the goddess <i>Lakshmi</i>'.\n\nThe word जु which was mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i> is redundant here.\n\nVart:- There is reduplication of the verbs द्युत् 'to shine', गम् 'to go' and हु 'to invoke', when क्विप् follows. As, विद्युत् 'shining'; जगत् 'going, the world'.\n\nVart:- There is lengthening also of the vowel of जुहुः as जुहूः 'a crescent-shaped wooden ladle used for pouring the sacrificial ghee into the fire'.\n\nVart:- The root टृ 'to tear' is shortened also; as दटृत् 'tearing'.\n\nVart:- The verb ध्या 'to think' has <i>samprasarana</i>; as धीः 'thinking'.",
    "32179": "As, विभूः 'a person called <i>Vibhu</i>'; प्रतिभूः 'a surety i. e. he who stands intermediate between the debtor and the creditor'.",
    "32180": "As विभुः 'all pervading'; प्रभुः 'lord'; सम्भुः 'Creator'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it is not a proper name'? Observe विभूः 'a person called <i>Vibhu</i>'.\n\nVart:- The words मितद्रु &c, also are formed by this affix. As मितद्रु 'the sea'; शम्भुः 'causing happiness'.\n\nWhy have we applied डु and not क्विप् to this root, as the forms would have been the same in either case? We have done so for two purposes: (1) To prevent the rules relating to <i>dhatus</i> from applying to this. (2) To prevent the insertion of तुक् augment. Thus the Ist. dual of मितद्रु is मितद्रू, Ist. pl. is मितद्रवः । Here there is no substitution of उकङ् which the rule [[6.4.77]] required, if द्रु had retained its <i>dhatu</i> characteristic; so also this rule of accent in [[6.1.175]] does not apply to Instrumental sing. मितद्र्वा &c, (2.) We have no त् which rule (VI. I. 71) required. मितं द्रवति = मितद्रुः ।",
    "32181": "The indicatory ष denotes that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (ई) affix. As धात्री 'a nurse whom the children suck (<i>dhayanti</i>)'; and '<i>Amalaki</i> fruit which holds (<i>dadhati</i>) all medicinal properties'.",
    "32182": "As दात्र, Ist. sing. neuter दात्रम् 'a sickle' (lit. that with which one cuts); नेत्र Ist. sing. नेत्रम् 'eye'; शस्त्रं [[7.2.9]] 'a weapon'; योत्रं 'the tie that fastens the yoke'; योक्रम् 'the tie of yoke'; स्तोत्रं 'a penegyric'; तोत्रं 'a goad', सेत्रं 'a ligament'; सेक्रं 'a sprinkling vessel'; मेड्ढ्रम् 'the penis'; पत्रम् 'a vehicle'; दंष्ट्रा 'a large tooth'.\n\nThe word दंष्ट्रा belongs to the <i>Ajadi</i> class and hence forms its feminine in टाप् (आ) and not in ई [[4.1.4]].\n\nThe root दंश is read in the aphorism without its nasal i e. as दश्. This indicates by implication that दश् loses its nasal before some affixes such as ल्युट्; thus we have दशनम् 'tooth'\n\nAnd lastly नह् + ष्ट्रन् = नद्ध्र fem. नद्ध्री [[8.2.34]] and (40), 'a thong'.",
    "32183": "The verb पू includes both पूङ् and पूञ् as पोत्रम् 'a plough-share'; पोत्रमे 'the snout of a hog'.",
    "32184": "Thus, अरित्रं 'a rudder'; लवित्रं 'a sickle'; धवित्रं 'a fan'; सवित्रं 'cause of production'; खनित्रं 'a spade'; सहित्रं 'patience'; चरित्रं 'an instituted observance or a narrative'.",
    "32185": "The verb पू includes two verbs पूङ् and पूञ् both meaning 'to purify', but belonging to two different conjugations; as पवित्रं an instrument for cleansing or purifying, such as a sieve or a strainer; and in this sense it means 'two blades of <i>Kusa</i> grass used at sacrifices in purifying and sprinkling <i>ghee</i>'. It also means 'the sacred thread, the clarified butter, &c'.",
    "32186": "That is to say, when applied to a <i>Rishi</i> the force is that of an instrument, and when applied to a <i>Devata</i> the force is that of an agent. As, पवित्रोऽयमृषिः 'this sage is sacred' (through whose instrumentality one is sanctified); अग्निः पवित्रं स मा पुनातु 'the God <i>Agni</i> is sacred' (one that purifies), 'let him purify me'. So also, वायुः सोमः सूर्य इन्द्रः पवित्रं ते मा पुनन्तु ।",
    "32187": "The <i>Nishtha</i> affix क्त, as a general rule, is a past participial affix and denotes past time; and is so ordained by rule (III 2.102). The present <i>sutra</i> thus makes an exception in case of those verbs which are marked with an indicatory ञि in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>; as ञिमिदा 'to be affectionately inclined'; मिन्नः (मिद् + क्त = मिङ् + त = मिन् + न [[8.2.42]] 'being affectionately inclined'. So ञिक्षिवदा — क्ष्विणः 'sounding inarticulately'; ञिधृषा — धृष्टः 'bold'. The <i>anuvritti</i> of वर्तमाने 'in the sense of the present', is read into this <i>sutra</i> from [[3.2.123]].",
    "32188": "The word मति means 'wish' or 'desire'; बुद्धि means 'knowledge'; and पूजा means 'worship', 'honor' or 'respect'. As राज्ञां मतः, - इष्टः, -बुद्धः, -ज्ञातः, -पूजितः, &c. 'the king wishes, desires, thinks, knows, honors, respects &c'.\n\nThe force of the word च is to include other kinds of verbs not included in the above <i>sutra</i>. Thus the following participles have their senses confined not to the past time only: शीलितः 'practised'; रक्षितः 'protected'; क्षान्तः 'forbearing'; आक्रुष्टः 'censured'; जुष्टः 'pleased'; रुष्टः 'angry'; रुषितः 'angry'; अभिव्याहृतः 'uttered'; तृष्टः 'happy'; तुष्टः 'satisfied'; कान्तः 'favourite'; संयतः 'restrained'; उद्यतः 'ready'; कष्टं 'evil, misery' (with a future signification); and अमृत 'immortal. So also :- सुप्तः 'sleeping'; शयितः 'lying down'; आशितः 'eaten'; लिप्तः 'smeared'; तृप्तः 'satisfied'; all these have a present signification.",
    "33001": "The phrase 'with the force of the present' (implying neither past nor future time) and 'with a sense simply appellative' (and not descriptive) must be read into this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutras</i> [[3.2.123]] & [[3.2.185]]. By using the word 'diversely' it is indicated that these affixes are, of course, applied after roots about which they are ordained, but they come also after roots about which they are not ordained. Sometimes we must infer their application by seeing actual words. Some affixes, though there be no express injunction regarding them, are to be inferred to belong to this class. The maxim in regard to the <i>Unadi</i> affixes is that when, in appellatives, we find the forms of verbal roots and affixes coming after them, then we may know, from the result as presented in the word, what are the indicatory letters which the affix must be possessed of in order to produce the result.\n\nThese affixes are not given in <i>Panini</i>'s work, but they have been separately collected. The affix उण् is the first of these. The first <i>sutra</i> of <i>Unadi</i> affixes is the following-\n\nकृवापाजिमिस्वदिसाध्यशूभ्य उण् ॥\n\nThe affix उण् comes after the verbs कृ 'to make', वा 'to blow', पा 'to drink', जि 'to overcome', नि 'to scatter', स्वद 'to be pleasant to the taste', साध् 'to accomplish', and अश् 'to pervade'.\n\nThus कृ + उण् = कारुः 'an artisan'. So also, वायुः 'the wind'; पायुः 'the organ of excretion'; जायुः 'a drug (which overcomes disease)'; मायुः 'the bile'; स्वादुः 'sweet'; साधुः 'who accomplishes the object of another, hence virtuous'; and आशुः 'quickly'.\n\nThese <i>Unadi</i> affixes come after a limited number of roots, and not after every root, as the affixes taught in this grammar whose application is general; hence the word बहुल has been employed. Moreover there has been no exhaustive enumeration of the several roots after which these affixes come: only some of them have been collected in works treating of <i>Unadi</i> affixes. Thus though the affixes उलच् is ordained after हृष, it comes also after शक as शङ्कुला. In fact there is a long discussion and it was a moot point at the time of <i>Panini</i> whether these words said to be formed by <i>Unadi</i> affixes were really derivative, or primitive ones. Moreover all the operations of these affixes have not been shown, that is their effects are not without remainder (सशेष). They are valid and good if found in sacred Scriptures or secular literature. The authors of <i>Niruktas</i> and grammarians of the school of <i>Sakatayana</i>, consider all nouns and substantives (नाम) as derivative words from simple roots (धातुज). Therefore where the derivation of a word is not apparent, one should infer the existence of proper base (प्रकृति) or affix (प्रत्यय) to form such a word.\n\nThe following slokas will be of some use to the student for ascertaining the <i>Unadi</i> affixes.\n\nबाहुलकं प्रकृतेस्तनुदृष्टेः प्रायसमुच्चयनादपि तेषाम् ।\nकार्यसशेषविधेश्च तदुक्तं नैगमरूढिभवं हि सुसाधु ॥ १ ।\nनाम च धातुजमाह निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम् ।\nयन्न पदार्थविशेषसमुत्थं प्रत्ययतः प्रकृतेश्च तदूह्यम् ॥ २ ॥\nसञ्ज्ञासु धातुरूपाणि प्रत्ययाश्च ततः परे ।\nकार्याद्विद्यादनूबन्धमेतच्छास्त्रमुणादिषु ॥ ३ ॥",
    "33002": "By the last <i>sutra</i>, it was taught that the <i>Unadi</i> affixes come with the force of the present time. The present aphorism teaches that they come with the force of the past also, not as a general rule, but in special cases. The force of the words 'are seen' being that no general rule can be laid down about it, but on finding that certain words have a past significance, we conclude that the affix in that particular case has the force of the past time.\n\nThus वृत् + मनिन् = वर्त्मन् 'a way, road' (that which has been established as a rule); चर् + मनिन् = चर्मन् 'skin' (that which is lived in); so also भस्मन् 'ashes' (that which has been reduced to ashes).",
    "33003": "The force of the future time is in the affix, and is so ordained, and not in the original word which takes the affix. Thus we see that the <i>Unadi</i> affixes, in a way, do come with the force of not only present, but past and future also, though in the latter two cases its scope is very limited. As गमी ग्रामम् 'intending to go to the village'; आगामी 'that which has to come' So also प्रस्थायी 'departing'; प्रतिरोधी 'an opponent', (who is going to obstruct). प्रतिबोधी 'going to be awakened'. So also प्रतियोधी 'an adversary'; प्रतियोगी 'an enemy'; प्रतियायी; आयायी; भावी, &c.\n\nVart:- The Future, for the purposes of this rule, must be <i>anadyatana</i> future i. e. the affix should come in the sense of what will happen but not in the course of the current day. In other words, the force must be of the first future लुट्, and not of the second future लृट्. As श्वो गमी ग्रामम् 'he intends to go to the village tomorrow'.",
    "33004": "The present tense has the force of the future when the adverbs यावत् and तावत् are used. The phrase 'futurity &c' is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> from the last. Thus आलोके ते निपतति पुरा 'he will surely fall in the range of your sight'. यावदस्य दुरात्मनः समुन्मूलनाय शत्रुघ्नं प्रेषयामि. 'I shall send <i>Satrughna</i> to exterminate this wretch'.\n\nThese words पुरा and यावत् must be used as adverbs (<i>nipatas</i>), and not as relative pronouns. Therefore not here, यावद् दास्यति तावद् भोक्ष्यते 'as long as he will give, so long he will eat'; पुरा ब्रजिष्यति 'he goes along the city'. Here यावत् is a relative pronoun; and पुरा is the Instrumental singular of पुर् 'city'.",
    "33005": "As कदा भुङ्क्ते 'when will he eat', or कदा भोक्ष्यते or भोक्ता; so also कर्हिभुङ्क्ते or भोक्ष्यते or भोक्ता 'when will he eat'.",
    "33006": "The word 'optionally' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. By using the word वृत्त along with किं it is meant that the rule applies even when किम् takes the affixes डतर and डतम. The word लिप्सा means 'the desire of gaining or acquiring, a wish to have something or an intention of begging'.\n\nAs कं भवन्तो भोजयन्ति or भोजयितारः 'whom will you feed'? It implies a request on the part of the questioner to feed him also. So also कतरो भिक्षां दास्यति, ददाति, दाता, or कतमो भिक्षां दास्यति &c, 'Which of the two or which of these all, will he give alms? Will he give something to me'?\n\nWhen no desire of gain is implied, the future tense must be employed as कः पाटलीपुत्रं गमिष्यति 'who will go to <i>Pataliputra</i>'.",
    "33007": "The word 'optionally' is also understood here. The word लिप्स्यमानसिद्धिः is equal to लिप्स्यमानात् सिद्धि, an Ablative-<i>Tatpurusha</i> Compound, signifying <i>siddhi</i> or success, that would be acquired by another by complying with the request of the speaker. The difference between this and the last <i>sutra</i> is, that whereas the last related to interrogative sentences having किम् in construction, the present relates to sentences in general. As यो भक्तं ददाति, स स्वर्गं गच्छति 'he who gives food, goes to heaven'; यो भक्तं दास्यति or दाता, स स्वर्गं गमिष्यति or गन्ता.\n\nHere the speaker encourages the giver to the act of charity by holding out the hope, that from rice which is the object desired (लिप्स्यमान) the success (सिद्धि), in the shape of <i>svarga</i>, will accrue to the giver.\n\nIn other words, 'the present is sometimes used for the future in conditional sentences, i.e., it is employed in connection with a sentence declaring the compensation or reward which follows from the granting of the wish'.",
    "33008": "The word लोडर्थ means 'having the sense of the affix लोट् or imperative mood'. The force of <i>lot</i> is 'to command, direct, invite &c' as given in [[3.3.162]] and [[3.3.163]]. The <i>sutra</i>, translated literally, will mean 'the present tense may optionally be employed when the action denoted by the verb is related to another action denoted by another verb in the imperative, as a sign (लक्षण) is to the thing signified (लक्ष्य)'. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छति (आगमिष्यति or आगन्ता) अथ त्वं छन्दोऽधीष्व 'if the professor comes (i.e. will come) then read you prosody'. Here the coming of the professor is the <i>lakshana</i> of the direction as to reading.",
    "33009": "All the conditions of the last <i>sutra</i> apply here also, namely 'when the action denoted by the verb is related to another action denoted by another verb in the imperative, as a sign is to the thing indicated'. By force of the word च we read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>lat</i> also into this aphorism. The word ऊर्ध्वमौहूर्त्तिक is a secondary derivative from ऊर्ध्वमुहूर्त्त, meaning 'that which exists in time above a <i>muhurta</i>'. This is an irregular compound; and the <i>vriddhi</i> takes place irregularly of the उ of मु and not of ऊ as the general rule required. The whole word thus formed qualifies the word 'future'. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेत् (आगच्छति, आगमिष्यति or आगन्ता), अथ त्वं छन्दोऽधीष्व 'If the teacher comes after an hour (of 48 minutes), you had better read the Prosody'.",
    "33010": "As भोक्तुम् व्रजति 'he goes to eat'; भोजको व्रजति 'he goes to eat'. Here the <i>upapada</i> or the verb in construction is व्रजति; it denotes an action performed for the sake of the future action (क्रियार्था), namely, eating.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting an action'? The <i>upapada</i> must be an action and not a substantive; as भिक्षिस्ये इति अस्य जटाः 'matted hair is for the purpose that he should beg.' Here the affixes are not employed.\n\nWhy do we say 'performed for the sake of another action'? Observe धावतस्ते पतिष्यति दण्डः 'running, thy stick will fall'.\n\nNow, it might be asked why ण्वुल् is taught a second time, when it was already taught generally by rule [[3.1.133]]; and that being a common rule, would have applied to this subject also? If you reply that the future affix लृट् would have prevented its application, in conditional sentences like the above, we say that the rule of 'non-uniform affixes applying simultaneously' given in [[3.1.94]] will step in and will conduce the application of ण्वुल् in spite of लृट्.\n\nVart:- The repetition of the affix ण्वुल् (ordained to come after a verbal root, when the word in construction therewith is another verb denoting an action performed for the sake of the future action,) is for the sake of prohibiting the application of the affixes like तृच् &c. in denoting the above sense; that is to say, the rule of वाऽसरूप [[3.1.94]] does not apply here and we cannot optionally employ any other affix, with this gerundial sense. Thus we cannot say कर्त्ता व्रजति 'he goes to do'; but we must say कर्तुम् instead.\n\nThese affixes form the gerund of the infinitive of purpose.",
    "33011": "As पाकाय व्रजति 'he goes to cook'; भूतये व्रजति 'he goes for the sake of success'; पुष्टये व्रजति ।\n\nNow it might be asked, why make this rule at all, when those affixes have already been ordained? It has already been said that the वाऽसरूप rule does not apply in regard to infinitive; and hence तुमुन् would have prevented the application of other affixes. So the making of the present <i>sutra</i>.\n\nWhy the word वचन has been employed in the <i>sutra</i> ? The meaning is that the words should be expressive or वाचक. How do the affixes become वाचक ? When affixes which are ordained after certain bases, are employed after those bases only, then they are said to be वाचक, not when they are employed after other bases, or are even after those bases, but not in the mode as directed. So that, in short, those nouns only which have been especially formed by the भाववाच्य affixes, घञ् &c, can be employed with the force of gerund, and not every noun. The भाववाच्य nouns correspond to the nouns of action or verbal nouns.",
    "33012": "The word 'future' is understood here. The force of च is merely that of a connective particle. By rule (III. 2. 1.) the affix अण् comes after a root when the word in composition is in the accusative case. That is a general injunction; and the rule of वाऽसरूप not applying, the affix ण्वुल would have debarred it as already said; hence this repetition. This rule being an <i>apavada</i> rule (an exception or a special rule with regard to those verbs which have the accusative case in composition) will thus, within its own jurisdiction, prevent the application of ण्वुल् of [[3.3.10]]; and by the rule of परत्व given in [[1.4.2]], it will debar the affixes like क &c. Therefore this अण् comes after even those verbs also which were especially exempted from its operation by rules like [[3.2.3]]. Thus by rule [[3.2.3]] the अण् of (III. 2. I) could not have come after simple verbs ending in long आ, such as दा 'to give' &c. But the present अण् with a gerundial force will come even after such verbs. As गोदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give cows', and not गोदः । So also कम्बलदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give blanket'; अश्वदायो व्रजति । दा + अण् = दायः [[7.3.33]].\n\nSo also काण्डलावो व्रजति 'he goes to cut wood'. In this case अण् would have been applied even by [[3.2.1]].",
    "33013": "This is what is well-known as the Second Future. As करिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will do'; हरिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will take'. So also, करिष्यति 'he will do'; हरिष्यति 'he will take'. Thus the Second Future is used both in dependent sentences as well as to denote simple Future.",
    "33014": "The सत् has been defined in [[3.2.127]]. This option is a regulated option; that is to say, the affixes शतृ and शानच् replace लृट् under the conditions in which they replace लट्; thus by [[3.2.124]], these affixes will replace लृट् when agreeing with what does not end with the first case-affix. In these cases सत् will invariably replace लृट्. In other cases it will optionally replace लृट्. In these cases they will form what is known as future participles. As करिष्यन्तं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold <i>Devadatta</i> about to do'; करिष्यमाणं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold <i>Devadatta</i> being about to be done'. हे करिष्यन् or हे करिष्यमाण. Besides simple futurity, it denotes intention or purpose, as अर्जयिष्यमाणो वसति 'he dwells intending to earn his livelihood'; करिष्यमाणः सशरं शरासनं 'intending to furnish his bows with arrows'.\n\nWhen, however, it agrees with the nominative case, it is optionally employed. As करिष्यन्, करिष्यमाणः, करिष्यति or करिष्यते देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> will do'.\n\nThe form करिष्यन् is thus evolved. As कृ + लृट् = कृ + स्य + लृट् [[3.1.33]] = कर + इट् + स्य + शतृ = करिष्यत् nom. sing. करिष्यन् । In other words the participial affixes अत् (अन्त) and मान, technically known as शतृ and शानच्, also come after a verb that has taken the personal ending स्य of the Future.",
    "33015": "This debars '<i>Lrit</i>'. As श्वः कर्ता 'he will do tomorrow'. श्वो भोक्ता 'he will eat tomorrow'.\n\nThe word '<i>anadyatana</i>' is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound. Therefore in cases where there is not pure futurity beyond today, but a mixture of the two, लृट् will be employed and not लुट्. As अद्य श्वो वा भविष्यति 'it will be today or tomorrow'. And where there is doubt, the second Future should be employed.\n\nVart:- The First Future (लुट्) is employed with the force of the Second Future (लृट्) when sorrow is expressed. As इयं तु कदा गन्ता, यैवं पादौ निदधाति । 'Oh when will she go, who places her feet in such a way (who is such a slow walker)' अयं तु कदाऽध्येता, य एवमनभियुक्तः 'when will he learn, who is so inattentive' !",
    "33016": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of 'future' does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. The affixes hereinafter taught come in all the tenses.\n\nAs पद + घञ् = पादः 'foot'; रुज् + घञ् = रोगः 'disease'; so, वेशः 'entrance'.\n\nVart:- The verb स्पृश् takes घञ् when the sense is that of 'distress'; as स्पर्शः 'disease' or 'warmth'. The word स्पर्श meaning 'touch' is formed by adding the affix अच्, under rule [[3.1.134]]; as स्पर्शो देवदत्तः । There is difference in accent between these two words.",
    "33017": "The word स्थिर means an object remaining steady throughout any period of time. That which thus remaining permanent moves through any interval of time, will apply to the agent of the verb. Thus, सृ + घञ् = सारः 'an essence'; as चन्दनसारः 'the essence of sandal', खदिरसारः 'the essence of catechu'.\n\nWhy do we say 'permanently fixed'? Observe सर्त्ता 'moves', सारकः 'that which flows'.\n\nVart:- The word so formed also applies to disease, fish and strength. As अतिसारः 'dysentery'; विसारः 'a fish'; सारः 'strength'.",
    "33018": "Thus, पच् + घञ् = पाकः 'cooking' [[7.2.116]] and [[7.3.52]]; त्यागः 'abandoning'; रागः 'colouring' [[6.4.27]]. An action expresses a general state; so that all roots denote 'action' when their meaning is to be expressed. And as the meaning of the root can be expressed by the root itself, therefore, the affixes घञ् &c. come after all verbal roots, when the sense of the root is denoted as having attained to the completed state. It is not necessary that the words so formed should be always of the masculine gender, singular number. They may take any other gender or number. As पक्तिः, पचनम्, पाकौ, पाकाः । These affixes form, in short, verbal nouns, or abstract nouns being names of action.",
    "33019": "Thus प्रासः (i.e. प्रास्यन्ति तम्) 'a dart, lit. that which men throw'; प्रसेवः (i.e. प्रसीव्यन्ति तम्) 'a sack, lit. that which men stitch together'; आहारः (i.e. आहरन्ति अस्माद्रसम्) 'food, lit. that from which men take out the juice to nourish themselves'. As मधुराहारः, तक्षशिलाहारः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'not related as an agent'? Observe मेषः 'a sheep, lit. that which looks helplessly'. Here the word मेष is related to the verb मिषति as agent, and the affix is consequently not घञ्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an appellative'? Observe कर्तव्यः कटः 'the mat must be made'.\n\nThe force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that घञ् may be applied irregularly in cases where appellative is not meant: as को भवता दायो दत्तः 'what gift was given by you'; को भवता लाभो लब्धः 'what gain was gained by you'.\n\nThe word कारक is used in the <i>sutra</i> for this purpose. The word अकर्तरि is a compound word formed by the negative नञ्. The word means a non-agent. Now the word 'non-agent' has two-fold significance; either it means any other <i>karaka</i> which is not an agent-<i>karaka</i>; or it may mean any thing in general which is not an agent. That is to say, the former negative, called पर्युदास, points out, by implication, the objects which are different from the thing prohibited; and in fact, makes the rule applicable to those objects, while the second sort of negative called प्रसज्य प्रतिषेध is a simple prohibition of the particular matter specified, without mentioning what is different from it. Giving the former interpretation to the word अकर्तरि, the word कारक becomes redundant, because 'non-agent' would mean any <i>karaka</i> other than an agent. But the very fact, that कारक is used, indicates the existence of the following rule which is nowhere expressly taught by <i>Panini</i> :-That नञ् is compounded even with the force of प्रसज्य प्रतिषेध. (VI. I. 45). अशित्, non-'<i>sit</i>'.\n\nBoth the phrases, 'when denoting mere condition (भाव)' and 'a <i>karaka</i>' 'which is not an agent' are understood in the succeeding aphorisms. See (II 2. 6) about नञ् Compound.",
    "33020": "Thus, नि + चि + घञ् = निचै + अ [[7.2.115]] = निचाय [[6.1.78]] 'a heap'; as एकस्तण्डुलनिचायः; द्वौ शूर्पनिष्पवौ । कॄ 'to scatter' + घञ् = कारः । द्वौ कारौ; त्रयः काराः ।\n\nBy using the word 'all' in the <i>sutra</i>, it is indicated that the affix अप् [[3.3.57]] is also superseded when this sense is to be indicated. Otherwise the affix अच् would only be prohibited by the <i>Paribhasha</i>:-\"<i>Apavadas</i> that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the <i>apavada</i>-operations, supersede only those rules that stand nearest to them, not the subsequent rules\". Thus अच् being taught in [[3.3.56]] would be superseded, but not so अप् taught in the subsequent aphorism [[3.3.57]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when they are the names of measures'? Observe निश्चयः 'ascertaining'.\n\nThe word आख्यः has been used in the aphorism in order to indicate that the words so formed are not Primitive words (रूढि). The numerals are also there included, and not only measures like <i>Prastha</i>, <i>Pala</i> &c.\n\nWe have said above, that the force of the word सर्वेभ्यः in this <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that the affix घञ् must be used after all verbs (not excluding even such verbs as require अच् or अप् by <i>sutras</i> 56 and 57), when we want to express measure. This must be taken however, with certain limitations. The word सर्वेभ्यः is not after all so wide as at first sight it may appear. If we wish to form a word indicating measure, in the feminine gender, we cannot use घञ्; we must use the affix क्तिन् [[3.3.94]]. In other words, the feminine affixes are not superseded by घञ् when it supersedes अच् and अप्. Thus in forming a feminine noun denoting measure, we have एकातिलोच्छित्तिः, द्वे प्रसूती &c.\n\nVart:- The affix घञ् comes after the causative verbs दारि and जारि, and there is <i>luk</i> elision of the causative affix णिच्; when the word so formed is related to the verb as agent. Thus दारयन्ति भ्रातॄन् = दाराः 'a wife' (lit 'who divides brothers' a wife breaking up the brotherly love); जारयन्ति = जाराः 'a paramour'.",
    "33021": "This debars अच् [[3.3.56]]. As अधि+ इ + घञ् = अधि + ऐ + अ = अध्याय 'a lesson or lecture'; उपाध्यायः (उपेत्यास्मादधीते) 'a teacher'.\n\nVart:- When the word to be formed is related to the verb इङ् as an ablative, the word is feminine also and optionally takes the affix ङीष्. As उपेत्याधीयतेऽस्या = उपाध्याया or उपाध्यायी 'a female teacher'.\n\nVart:- The affix घञ् comes after the root शॄ when the word so formed means 'wind', 'color', or 'cessation'. As शारः 'wind', 'green colour' &c. गौरिवाकृतमीशारः प्रायेण सिशिरे कृशः ।",
    "33022": "This debars अप् [[3.3.57]]. As संरावः 'clamour', उपरावः &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>'? Observe रवः 'sound'.",
    "33023": "As संयावः, सन्द्रावः, सन्दावः । But प्रयवः where the preposition is not <i>sam</i>.",
    "33024": "This debars the affix अच् [[3.3.56]]. As श्रायः 'shelter', नायः 'a means', भावः 'a condition'.\n\nBut with <i>upasargas</i>, we have प्रश्रयः 'respect', प्रणयः 'love'; प्रभवः 'source'.\n\nHow do we explain the form प्रभाव in प्रभावो राज्ञः 'the splendour of the king'? Here the word प्रभाव is not made from the compound root प्रभू + घञ्, but by compounding प्र with भाव by the rules of <i>samasa</i>, meaning 'excellent condition'.\n\nHow do you explain the form नय in नयो राज्ञः ? Here the root नी has taken the affix अच् diversely by [[3.3.113]].",
    "33025": "This debars the affix अप् [[3.3.57]]; as, विक्षावः 'cough'; विश्रावः 'flowing forth', 'celebrated'. But when without preposition, we have क्षवः and श्रवः ।",
    "33026": "As अवनायः 'throwing down'; उन्नायः 'elevation'.\n\nHow do you explain उन्नयः in उन्नयः पदार्थानाम् ? Here the affix is '<i>ach</i>' by [[3.3.113]].",
    "33027": "As प्रद्रावः, प्रस्तावः, प्रस्रावः। But not so in द्रवः, स्तवः and स्रवः ।",
    "33028": "The word पू refers to both पूङ् and पूञ्. The rule (I. 3. 10.) must be applied here, and thus निर् comes before पू, and अभि before लू । As निष्पावः 'winnowing'; अभिलावः 'moving'. But पवः and लवः, without these prepositions.",
    "33029": "The verb गृ here refers to both the verbs गृ 'to make sound', and गृ 'to swallow'. As उद्गारः समुद्रस्य 'the roaring of the sea'; निगारो देवदत्तस्य 'the swallowing of <i>Devadatta</i>'. But when without these prepositions, we have गरः ।",
    "33030": "The verb कॄ here means 'to scatter', and not 'to injure', because no words formed by this affix are found in Sanskrit in that sense.\n\nAs उत्कारो धान्यस्य 'the winnowing of corn'; निकारो धान्यस्य  the winnowing of corn'. But when not referring to grain, we have भैक्षवोत्करः 'a heap of alms', पुष्पनिकरः 'the essence or heap of flowers'.",
    "33031": "As संस्तावश्छन्दोगानाम् 'the <i>Sanstava</i> of the <i>Chhandogas</i>'; संस्ताव (= समेत्य स्तुवन्ति यस्मिन् देशे छन्दोगाः स देशः) means 'the place which the <i>Brahmanas</i> repeating hymns and prayers, occupy at a sacrifice'.\n\nBut when not referring to sacrifice we have संस्तवश्छात्रयोः 'the praising together of the two pupils'.",
    "33032": "As, शङ्खप्रस्तारः 'a bed of conch'; मणिप्रस्तारः 'strewing of gems'.",
    "33033": "The word प्रथनं means 'extent, circuit, range'. As पटस्य विस्तारः 'the extension of the garment'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning extent'? Observe, तृणविस्तरः 'a collection of grass'. Why do we say 'not referring to words'? Observe विस्तरो वचसाम् 'prolixity of words'.",
    "33034": "The word छन्द here means prosodial metre such as <i>Gayatri</i> & c; and not the Vedas; otherwise the word नाम would not have been used. Thus वि + स्तृ + घञ् = वि + स्तृ + घञ् [[8.3.94]] = विष्टारः 'the name of a metre called <i>Vishtara</i>-<i>Pankti</i>'.\n\nThe whole word विष्टारपङ्क्ति is the name of a metre, and is not a word ending with the affix <i>ghan</i>; only a member of this word, i.e. the first part ends with <i>ghan</i>. The seventh case-affix in the word छन्दोनाम्नि has the force of location i.e. when the word so formed occurs in a portion of a name of a metre; it is not the full name, but it is in the name i.e. forms a portion of the name.",
    "33035": "This debars the affix अप्. As उद्ग्राहः 'lifting up'.\n\nVart:- In the Vedas this affix is applied even when the word  ग्रह is preceded by नि; and the ह is changed into भ; the sense of the two words being 'to lift up' and 'throw down' respectively of the sacrificial ladle; as, उद्ग्राभं च निग्राभं च ब्रह्मदेवा अवीवृधन् ।",
    "33036": "The word मुष्टि means 'boxing', 'fist'; as, अहो मल्लस्य सङ्ग्राहः 'O! the clenching of the fist of the athlete'; अहो मुष्ठिकस्य सङ्ग्राहः 'O! the seizing of the boxer', meaning grasping firmly.\n\nWhy do we say 'referring to fist'? Observe सङ्ग्रहो धान्यस्य 'a collection of grain'.",
    "33037": "Here again we take help of [[1.3.10]] in interpreting this <i>sutra</i>. The verbs परि + नी and नि + इ, take घञ् when respectively meaning 'gambling' and 'fitness'. As परिणायेन शारान् हन्ति 'he kills (or takes) many pieces by moving a chessman.' Here परिणायेन = समन्तान्नय means 'the moving of chess-pieces from every side, and so winning the game'. So also नि + इ + घञ् = नि + ऐ + अ = नि +  आय = न्यायः 'justice', 'propriety', 'logic'.\n\nBut when not having these senses, we have परिणयः 'marriage', and न्ययं 'decay'; as न्ययङ्गतः पापः 'the sin has been destroyed'. The word अभ्रेष means पदार्थानामनपचारो यथापापकरणम् ।",
    "33038": "As पर्यायः 'turn, succession'; तव पर्यायः 'thy turn'; मम पर्यायः 'my turn'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning turn'? Observe कालस्य पर्ययः 'the lapse of time'. The word अनुपात्ययः क्रमप्राप्तस्यानतिपातः 'not breaking the series or order'.",
    "33039": "As, तव विशायः 'thy turn of sleeping' (i.e. the rest enjoyed in rotation by the sentinels on watch); मम विशायः 'my turn of rest'; तव राजोपशायः राजानमुपशयितुम्पर्यायः 'thy turn of sleeping the king'.\n\nWhy do we say 'regular succession'? Observe उपशयः 'lying by the side of or ambush'; विशयः 'doubt'.",
    "33040": "By saying 'taking by hand' the close proximity of the person taking to the thing accepted or taken is indicated. As पुष्पप्रचायः 'gathering flowers by hand'; फलप्रचायः 'gathering fruits by hand'.\n\nWhy do we say 'taking by hand'? Observe वृक्षाग्रस्थानां फलानां यष्टया प्रचयं करोति 'he gathers with the stick the fruits hanging on the top of the tree'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not meaning to steal'? Observe पुष्पप्रचयश्चौर्येण 'the gathering of flowers by theft'.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the word उच्चयः 'gathering', as पुष्पोच्चयः 'gathering of flowers by hand'.",
    "33041": "That in which people dwell (निवसति) is called निवासः or 'dwelling'. That which is gathered together (चीयते) is called चिति or 'funeral pile'. शरीर means the body of all living beings; and उपसमाधान means making a heap. Thus निकाय 'a dwelling'; as in काशीनिकायः '<i>Kasi</i>-dwelling'; आकायमग्निं चिन्वीत 'let him arrange the <i>akaya</i> fire i.e. the funeral fire'; कायः 'body', as अनित्यः कायः 'a perishable body'; महान् गोमयनिकायः 'a heap of cow-dung'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when having these senses'? Observe चयः 'gathering'. Why is not this rule applied in महान् काष्ठनिचयः 'a large heap of wood'? Here multiplicity is expressed and not collection or aggregation.",
    "33042": "The word सङ्घ means a collection or assembly of living beings. It is of two sorts:- either by collection of persons possessing common qualifications, or a mere confused crowd of men. The collection denoting a confused crowd is here excepted and by <i>paryudasa</i> negation the other is taken. Thus भिक्षुकनिकायः 'the assembly of beggars'; ब्राह्मणनिकायः 'the assembly of <i>Brahmanas</i>'; वैयाकरणनिकायाः 'the assembly of Grammarians'.\n\nBut सूकरनिचयः 'a herd of hogs'; because it is a mere collection. So also कृताकृतसमुच्चयः 'the collection of what is done and not done'; प्रमाणसमुच्चयः 'the collection of proofs'. Here there is no सङ्घ in either of the two senses, it not being a collection of living animals, the affix <i>ghan</i> is not employed.",
    "33043": "The word कर्म means 'action' and is not the technical '<i>Karma</i>' meaning the accusative case. व्यतिहार means reciprocity or interchange of action. The word so evolved is feminine in form and denotes mere 'action' (भाव) also. The <i>anubandha</i> च in णच् is qualitative and is added to distinguish this affix from other affixes: thus in <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.14]] this particular affix is meant.\n\nThus वि + अव + क्रुश् + णच् + अञ् + ङीष् = व्यावक्रोशी (V. 4. 14,) and [[7.3.6]] 'mutual abuse'. So also व्यावहासी, व्यावलेखी. The affix णच् forms only an imaginary stem; for this stem must take the affix अञ् by [[5.4.14]], which even does not form the complete word until the affix ङीष् of the feminine is added.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the feminine'? Observe व्यतिपाको वर्तते ।\n\nThe making of this a separate <i>sutra</i> by itself and not reading it in the subdivision of feminine affixes beginning with क्तिन् [[3.3.94]] is for the sake of removing the obstructing aphorisms that would otherwise have prevented the application of this rule.\n\nFor, had it been taught in connection with क्तिन् &c, then the affixes that would have debarred क्तिन् &c, would a fortiori have debarred this also. But by keeping it separate from that class, it is indicated that those obstructive affixes which debar क्तिन् &c, do not debar this. Thus व्यावचोरी, व्यावचर्ची । Here चुर् being a ण्यन्त class root would have taken युच् [[3.3.107]] in the feminine, as चोरणा; and चर्च् would have taken अङ् by [[3.3.104]], as चर्चा. The roots ईक्ष् and ईह्, by [[3.3.102]] & [[3.3.103]], take अ by debarring क्तिन् । This debarring affix अ, however, is not debarred by this rule; as व्यतीक्षा, व्यतीहा are the proper feminine forms, and not व्यतीक्षी &c. The form व्यातुक्षी is, however, an apparent exception. All these exceptions, counter-exceptions &c. are examples of बहुलं taught in [[3.3.113]].",
    "33044": "The word अभिविधि means co-extensiveness, that is to say, the complete comprehension or relation between the action and the quality. Thus सांराविणम् 'a general or tumultuous uproar'; सं + कूट् + इन् + अण (V. 4. 15.) and (VI 4. 164) = 'a general confusion'; so सांस्राविणम् 'a general flow or stream'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning co-extensiveness'? Observe सङ्कोटः, संरावः, सन्द्रावः ।\n\nWhy do we use the word भाव again in this <i>sutra</i>, when its <i>anuvritti</i> was already flowing from <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.18]]? The object is that the वाऽसरूप rule [[3.1.94]] should not apply here and hence घञ् never comes in this sense. <i>Patanjali</i> says that the repetition is for the sake of indicating that in neuter gender, when co-extensiveness is expressed, the affixes क्त &c. are prohibited; so that the affixes क्त &c. should not come in the neuter with the force of भाव ।\n\nThe separateness of this <i>sutra</i> is for the same purpose as the last aphorism. The affix ल्युट् is not, however, prohibited; as सङ्कुटनम्. See rule कृत्यल्युटो बहुलं [[3.3.113]]. The affix इनुण् (the operative part being इन्) forms but an imaginary stem, which does not become real and complete till it takes the affix अण् by [[5.4.15]], as shown above.",
    "33045": "Though इनुण् is immediately, near, we take the <i>anuvritti</i> of घञ् [[3.3.16]], because we see that its <i>anuvritti</i> is possible.\n\nThe word आक्रोश means 'cursing'. As अवग्राहो हन्त ते वृषलभूयात् 'cursed be thou, O! sinner'. So also निग्राहस्ते भूयात् ।\n\nWhy 'when meaning cursing'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य; निग्रहश्चोरस्य ।",
    "33046": "As पात्रप्रग्राहेण चरति भिक्षुः पिण्डार्थी 'the beggar walks for the sake of alms, carrying a vessel in hand'; स्रुवप्रग्राहेण चरति द्विजो दक्षिणार्थी 'carrying a sacrificial ladle, the <i>Brahmana</i> walks about for his fee'. The word लिप्सा means 'the wish to have something'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning desire of gain'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य ।",
    "33047": "As उत्तरपरिग्राहः 'the northern fencing of the sacrificial altar'; अधरपरिग्राहः 'the southern fencing of the sacrificial altar'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when relating to sacrifices'? Observe परिग्रहः देवदत्तस्य 'the fencing of <i>Devadatta</i>'.",
    "33048": "The वृ here means both वृङ् and वृञ्. This debars the affix अप्. As नीवाराः 'rice growing wild or without cultivation'.\n\nWhy do we say 'meaning grain'? Observe निवरा कन्या 'a virgin girl'.",
    "33049": "This debars the affix <i>ach</i> [[3.3.56]]. Thus उच्छ्रायः 'rising of a planet'; उद्यावः 'mixing'; उत्पावः 'purifying ghee'; and उद्रावः 'flight'.\n\nHow do you explain the form समुच्छ्रयः in पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः ? The word विभाषा 'optionally' in the next <i>sutra</i>, exerts a retrospective effect on this <i>sutra</i>, and the form is an optional one. This is a most unusual thing and is called सिंहावलोकनन्यायः 'the maxim of the lion's backward glance'. It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind, while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bonds his neck backwards to see if any thing be within its reach.",
    "33050": "As आरावः or आरवः 'noise'; आप्लावः or आप्लवः 'bathing'.",
    "33051": "The word 'optionally' is understood here. The word वर्षप्रतिबन्ध means the absence of rain, from some cause or another, when the season has arrived; as अवग्राहः or अवग्रहो देवस्य 'the draught of rain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning obstruction of rain'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य ।",
    "33052": "Both the words <i>grah</i> and <i>vibhasha</i> are understood here. By 'relation to commerce' is meant here the string of the balance; and not commerce in general. That string by which a balance is held is called तुलाप्रग्रहः or तुलाप्रग्राहः, as तुलाप्रग्राहेण चरति or तुलाप्रग्रहेण चरति; and this may be said of any person whether he be a trader or not.\n\nWhy do we say 'when belonging to commerce'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य 'the whip of <i>Devadatta</i>'.",
    "33053": "The word रश्मि means here the bridle by means of which horses &c. joined to the carriage, are held under control; as प्रग्रहः or प्रग्राहः 'a rein'.",
    "33054": "As प्रावारः or प्रवरः 'a cloak, a veil'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it means a covering'? Observe प्रवरागौ ।",
    "33055": "The word अवज्ञान means 'contempt', 'neglect', 'disregard' &c. As परिभावः or परिभवः 'insult, humiliation'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when meaning disregard'? The word परिभवः may be then constructed to mean सर्वतोभवनं = परिभवः 'surrounding'.",

As भी + अच् = भयम् 'fear'; वर्षम् 'rain'. These being neuter words, otherwise would have taken the affix क्त &c. but for this <i>Vartika</i>.\n\nVart:- The words जव and सव are formed by this affix, and occur in the Vedas. As ऊर्वोरस्तु मे जयः, पञ्चोदनसवः । These roots जु and सु would have otherwise taken the affix अप्. The form would have been the same, but there would be difference of accent. See <i>Rig</i>.

As ग्रहः 'a planet'; वरः 'a boon'; दरः 'tearing, a cave'; निश्चयः 'certainty'; गमः 'march'.\n\nThe verb निश्चि would have taken अच्, but takes अप् which causes difference of accent.\n\nVart:-The roots वश् and रण् should also be included in this; as वशः 'obedient'; रणः 'battle'.\n\nVart:- When the sense is that of घञ्, the affix क is directed to be employed, after the following verbs :- स्था, स्ना, पा, व्यध्, हन् and युध् । As प्रस्थः 'a table-land' (on which they move); प्रस्नः 'a vessel for bathing' (in which they bathe); प्रपाः 'a place where water is distributed to travellers' (that out of which they drink); आविधः [[6.1.16]] 'an awl, a drill' (that by which they pierce); विघ्नः 'an obstacle' (in which they are obstructed); आयुधः 'battle' (where they fight).",

    "33065": "This debars the affix घञ्. Thus निक्वणः or निक्वाणः 'a musical tone'. क्वणः or क्वाणः 'sound'. When it refers to 'flute', it must have some <i>upasarga</i> not necessarily नि; as कल्याणप्रक्वणा वीणा.\n\nBut not so here, अतिक्वाणो वर्तते, where the <i>upasarga</i> being अति and the word not referring to 'a flute', no option is allowed. When flute is not meant the <i>upasarga</i> must be नि or no <i>upasarga</i> at all, for the optional application of the affix अप्. To sum up, क्वण् takes अप् optionally under three conditions:- Ist when preceded by नि, or 2ndly when having no <i>upasarga</i>, or 3rdly when it refers to 'flute', and then it must have some <i>upasarga</i>.",
    "33066": "The word नित्यं 'invariably' is used in the aphorism in order to stop the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word optionally. Thus मूलकपणः 'a handful of radishes'; शाकपणः 'a handful of vegetable'. These words secondarily have come to mean 'a measure equal to a handful', irrespective of any thing.\n\nWhen not meaning measure, we have पणः 'trade'.",
    "33067": "This debars घञ्. As विद्यामदः 'pride of knowledge'; धनमदः 'pride of wealth'; कुलमदः 'pride of family'. When compounded with <i>upasargas</i>, we have उन्मादः 'mad'; प्रमादः 'error or carelessness'.",
    "33068": "As कन्यानां प्रमदः 'the joy of girls'; कोकिलानां सम्मदः 'the rejoicing of cuckoos'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning delight'? Observe प्रमादः 'carelessness'; सम्मादः 'frenzy'.\n\nInstead of saying 'the verb <i>mad</i> preceded by <i>pra</i> and <i>sam</i> takes the affix <i>ap</i>' which also would have given the above forms, the full forms have been used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that these words are रूढि in this sense; for the sense of the root is not visible in these words.",
    "33069": "This debars घञ्. The root अज 'means to go, to throw'. When preceded by सम्, it means 'a collection'; and preceded by उत् it means 'driving'. As समजः पशूनां 'a herd of cattle'; उदजः पशूनां 'driving forth of cattle'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when applying to cattle'? Observe समाजो ब्राह्मणानां, उदाजः क्षत्रियाणां ।",
    "33070": "This word is derived from the root ग्रह्. The verb ग्रह् takes the affix अप् and thus forms ग्रह्, and then irregularly र is changed into ल; as अक्षस्य ग्लहः 'cast of the dice'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when referring to gambling'? Observe ग्रहः पादस्य ।\n \nOthers say, this word is derived regularly from the root ग्लह् 'to gamble', by adding the affix अप्, and thus debarring घञ्. They suppose, therefore, the existence of the root ग्लह्, to explain the form ग्लहः । The counter-example which they would give, is ग्लाहः 'receiving', formed by adding the affix घञ् ।",
    "33071": "This debars घञ्. The word प्रजनं means 'the first covering of a cow by a bull'. As गवामुपसरः 'impregnation of cows'; पशूनामुपसरः 'impregnation of cattle'.",
    "33072": "This debars घञ्. As नि + ह्वे + अप् = नि + हु + अ [[6.1.108]] = नि + हो + अ [[7.3.84]] = निहव [[6.1.78]] 'invocation'; अभिहवः 'invocation'; उपहवः 'invitation'; विहवः 'calling'. But प्रह्वायः 'a summons'.",
    "33073": "As आहवः 'battle' (where they challenge each other). But otherwise आह्वायः 'calling'.",
    "33074": "The word आहावः is irregularly formed from ह्वे by the prefix आ, then <i>samprasarana</i>, and the <i>vriddhi</i> of the vowel. Thus आ + ह्वे + अप् = आहु + अ = आहौ + अ = आहावः 'a trough near a well for watering cattle'. Otherwise आह्वायः 'calling'. Even in the word आहावः the sense of calling is understood. It is that place near a well, containing water, where cattle are called or invited to drink water.",
    "33075": "As हवः 'calling'; हवे हवे सुहवं शूरमिन्द्रम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when no <i>upasarga</i> is in composition with it'? Observe आह्वायः । Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word भाव was understood in this aphorism from <i>sutra</i> 18, its repetition here shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sutra</i> 19. which was running, must not be taken; so that this word applies to agent-<i>karaka</i> also.",
    "33076": "Thus वध has <i>udatta</i> accent on its final. The affix अप् which is <i>andatta</i> generally (III. I. 4) thus becomes <i>udatta</i>.\n\nAs वधश्चोराणाम् 'the killing of thieves'; वधोदस्यूनाम् 'the killing of robbers'.\n\nWhen action is not denoted, the affix घञ् applies; as घातः 'a blow'.\n\nSo also when an <i>upasarga</i> is in composition with it; as प्रघातः, घातः ।\n\nThe word च in the aphorism does not connect हन् with the substitute वध, there being no co-ordination, it refers to the affixes under discussion. Thus we have the affix घञ् also; as घातः 'killing'.",
    "33077": "The word मूर्त्ति means 'hardness', 'solidity'. Thus अभ्रघनः 'a mass of cloud'; दधिघनः 'solid curd'. How do we say घनं दधि ? Here the quality is taken for the thing qualified.",
    "33078": "As अन्तर् + हन् + अप् = अन्तर् = घन् + अ = अन्तर्घनः 'name of a country of <i>Bahika</i>'; (a porch or court, an open space before the house between the entrance door and the house). Some write the word with a ण as अन्तर्घणः, that is also valid.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a country'? Observe अन्तर्घातो 'striking in the middle'.",
    "33079": "Thus प्रघणः or प्रघाणः 'a porch before the door of a house, a portico'. This is formed from हन् with प्र, irregularly.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a portion of a house'? Observe प्रघातः ।",
    "33080": "This is formed from उत् + हन् irregularly. Thus उद्घनः 'a carpenter's bench' (the wood on which placing other planks &c. the carpenter carves &c).\n\nWhen not having this sense, we have उद्घातः 'uneven'.",
    "33081": "This is formed irregularly from अप + हन्. Thus अपघनः 'a limb or member of the body'. The word अङ्गम् means a portion of the body, such as hand or foot, and not the whole body. Otherwise we have अपघातः ।",
    "33082": "As अयोघनः 'a forge-hammer' (whereby the iron is destroyed); विघनः 'a mallet'; द्रुघनः 'an axe'. Some write द्रुघणः, the न being changed into ण either by rule (VIII. 4. 3.) or by including this word in the class of आरोहणादि [[4.2.80]].",
    "33083": "The word च in the <i>sutra</i> draws in अप् from the last aphorism and in that case घन् replaces हन्. Thus स्तम्बघ्नः or स्तम्बघनः 'a small hoe for weeding clumps of grass'. In the feminine gender, the forms are स्तम्बघ्ना as well as स्तम्बघना । when क is added, we have स्तम्बघ्नः । Thus हन् + क + ह्न् + अ [[6.4.98]] = घ्न [[7.3.54]]. When अप् is added हन् is totally replaced by घन् । When instrument is not meant, we have स्तम्बघातः ।",
    "33084": "Thus परिघः or पलिघः [[8.2.22]] 'an iron beam used for locking or shutting the gate, an iron club'.",
    "33085": "It is formed by adding अप् [[3.3.76]] to the verb हन् preceded by the <i>upasarga</i> उप, then eliding the penultimate अ of ह; this is the irregularity. Then by <i>sandhi</i> rules हन् is changed into घ्नः । This form would have been given by the affix क also, without any irregularity.\n\nThe word आश्रय refers to 'proximity, contiguity'. Thus पर्वतोघ्नः 'the declivity of the mountain'; so also ग्रामोपघ्नः 'bordering the village'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning support'? Observe पर्वतोपघातः ।",
    "33086": "These words are thus formed; सम् + हन् + अप् = सं + ह् + अ = सं + घ् + अ = सङ्घः। Thus सङ्घः पशूनाम् 'a herd of cattle'; so also उद्घो मनुष्यः 'an excellent man'. The word 'respectively' is inserted from [[1.3.10]]. When not used in these senses, we have सङ्घातः 'union'.",
    "33087": "The word निमित means 'measured all round' i.e. 'as high as broad'. As निघा वृक्षाः 'trees as high as broad'. निघा शालयः 'square or cubic or circular halls'. Otherwise, when not meaning 'as high as broad', we have निघातः 'a blow'. The word निमित = समन्तान्मितं, समारोहपरिणाहम् । It may be derived from मा or from मि । In the first case it will mean 'measured' and in the other, 'erected, built'. Professor Bothlingk refers to <i>Apastamba</i> <i>Dharma</i>. I. 20. 30 for the meaning of this word.",
    "33088": "The phrases 'when the sense is that of mere action', and 'when the sense is that of an appellative, the word being related to the verb from which its name is deduced, but not as agent', are of course understood in this, as in all the previous aphorisms. Then by [[4.4.20]], (of the affix क्ति, मप् is always the augment) we must add म, for we can not use the affix त्रि alone; but we must always use त्रिम. Thus डुपचष् to cook--पक्तिमम् 'what is ripe'; डुवप्--उपत्रिमम् 'sown' (VI. I. 15); डुकृञ्--कृत्रिमम् 'artificial'.",
    "33089": "As टुवेपृ--वेपथुः 'a trembling'; टुओश्वि--श्वयथुः 'swelling'; टुक्षुः--क्षवथुः 'sneezing'; टुदु--दवथुः 'burning'.",
    "33090": "The conditions of <i>sutras</i> 18 and 19 are understood here also. The ङ् of नङ् is for the sake of prohibiting <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> (I. I. 5); as यज्ञः 'sacrifice'; याच्ञा 'solicitation'; यत्नः 'effort'; विश्नः [[6.4.19]] 'lustre'; प्रश्नः 'a question'; रक्ष्णः 'protection.\n\n The root प्रच्छ, by [[6.1.16]], ought to have changed its र into ॠ before the ङित् affix नङ्. Its not doing so must be taken to be an irregularity countenanced by <i>Panini</i>, as we know from the fact that <i>Panini</i> himself uses the form प्रश्नः in (III. 2. II7).",
    "33091": "The final न् is indicatory and regulates the accent (VI. I. 197); as स्वप्नः 'a dream'.",
    "33092": "The क् is indicatory, by force of which the final आ is elided [[6.4.64]]. Thus प्र + दा + कि = प्रदिः 'a present'; प्रधिः 'the periphery of a wheel'; उपाधिः 'fraud'; अन्तर्द्धिः 'vanishing'.",
    "33093": "As जलधिः 'the ocean (in which water is held)';  शरधिः 'a quiver (that in which arrows are put)'.\n\nThe word 'location' in the aphorism indicates that the words so formed should have no other significance. The word च in the aphorism draws in the affix कि from the last <i>sutra</i>.",
    "33094": "The conditions of rules (III. 3. 18.) and [[3.3.19]] are understood here also. This supersedes घञ्, अच् and अप् affixes. Thus कृतिः 'action'; चितिः 'a gathering'; मतिः 'understanding'.\n\nVart:- The affix <i>ktin</i> should be declared to come after the verbs आप् 'to get' &c. There is no list of these words given anywhere, but by seeing the form, we can infer the affix. Thus आप्तिः 'getting'; राद्धिः 'accomplishment'; दीप्तिः 'shining'; स्रस्तिः 'a slip'; ध्वस्तिः 'destruction'; लब्धिः 'gain'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verbs श्रु 'to hear', यज् 'to worship' and स्तु 'to praise', when instrument is meant; as श्रुतिः 'ear' (that by which we hear); so इष्टिः 'a sacrifice'; स्तुतिः 'a praise.\n\nVart:- The affix नि comes after the verbs ग्लौ 'to be exhausted', म्लै 'to fade', ज्या 'to grow old' and हा 'to leave'; as ग्लानिः 'exhaustion'; म्लानिः 'fading', ज्यानिः 'old age'; हानिः 'loss'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्तिन् coming after verbs ending in long ॠ and the verbs लू &c. is like a <i>Nishtha</i>. Thus कीर्णिः 'scattering': This form is thus evolved: कॄ + क्तिन् = कि + ति [[7.1.100]] = किर् + ति [[1.1.51]] = कीर् + ति [[8.2.77]]. At this stage, त is changed into न by the affix being treated as a <i>Nishtha</i> [[8.2.42]], and this न is changed into ण by the ordinary rules of <i>sandhi</i>; so also गीर्णिः 'praise'; जीर्णिः 'old age'; शीर्णिः 'drying'; लूनिः [[8.2.44]] 'cutting'; यूनिः 'joining'; धूनिः 'agitation'; पूनिः 'destruction'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्विप् comes after the verbs सम्पत् & c; as सम्पत् 'prosperity'; विपत् 'a calamity'; प्रतिपत् 'access'. The affix क्तिन् is also employed after these verbs:-- as, सम्पत्तिः, विपत्तिः । The verbs लू &c. are 21 verbs of <i>kryadi</i> class.",
    "33095": "This debars the affix अङ् [[3.3.106]] which generally supersedes क्तिन् in cases of compound verbs ending in long आ. Thus प्रस्थितिः 'a journey' [[7.4.40]]; उद्गीति 'a singing aloud'; गै + क्ति = गा + ति [[6.1.45]] = गी + ति [[6.4.66]]; सगीतिः 'a concert'; प्रपीतिः 'a cistern'; सम्पीतिः 'drinking together'; पक्तिः 'cooking'.\n\nThe repetition of the word भाव in this aphorism, in spite of its <i>anuvritti</i> being understood from <i>sutra</i> 18 is to exclude every other significance.\n\nHow do we get forms like अवस्था and संस्था ? <i>Panini</i> himself, in his <i>sutras</i>, has used forms like व्यवस्था &c. See [[1.1.34]]. This is enough justification for us to derive forms like अवस्था, संस्था &c. by applying the affix अङ् under rule 106 inspite of the present <i>sutra</i>, which requires us to apply क्तिन् only.",
    "33096": "The construction of this <i>sutra</i> is anomalous. Instead of the bases being put in the ablative case, they are put in the nominative case. Thus वृष्टिः 'raining'; इष्टिः 'wishing'; पक्तिः 'cooking'; मतिः 'thinking'; वित्तिः 'knowing'; भूतिः 'being'; वीतिः 'consuming'; रातिः 'giving'.\n \nThe affix क्तिन् has been generally ordained by <i>sutra</i> 94 after all verbs. The present <i>sutra</i> is made for the sake of regulating the accent in the case of these nouns. From इष् we have also an irregular noun इच्छा (III 3. 101), and another by the general rule 94 having acute accent on the first syllable, altogether 3 forms. See <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> I. II6. 12; II 5. 6; 1.62. 3, 57. 2; IV. 24. 7; III. 39. I; I. 6. 5, 60. I; X. 95. 17 for these words.",
    "33097": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word मन्त्रे does not exist in this; but the word उदात्त of the last syllable is understood here. The word ऊति is thus formed :- अव् 'to protect' + क्तिन् = ऊ + तिः [[6.4.20]] = ऊतिः । this form is regular and could be evolved from <i>sutra</i> 94 also; but not so the accent. The irregularity in पूतिः and जूतिः consists in the lengthening of उ into ऊ; in सातिः the आ of the root सै which becomes सा by (VI. I 45), is not changed into इ, as rule [[7.4.40]] required, and this is the irregularity. This form may also be derived from the root सन् with perfect propriety, except as to the accent which would be regulated by the present <i>sutra</i>: thus सन् + क्तिन् = सा + क्तिन् [[6.4.42]] साति. The form हेति may by derived either from हन् or हिनोति ।\n\nइन्द्र वाजेषु नोऽव सहस्रप्रधनेषु च । उग्रउग्राभिरूतिभिः । (<i>Rig</i>. I. 7. 4) 'O <i>Indra</i>, mayst thou mighty, defend us in battles and in fights of a thousand duels, with thy mighty protections'.",
    "33098": "This supersedes क्तिन्. Thus व्रज्या 'wandering about'; इज्या [[6.1.15]] 'worshipping'. The प् of क्यप् is indicatory, and though it serves no purpose in this <i>sutra</i>, it is, however, necessary in the next, for it is by force of क्यप् having प् that we add a त by (VI 1. 71), in the words formed in the next aphorism.",
    "33099": "Thus समज्या 'an assembly'; निषद्या 'a small bed or couch'; निपत्या 'slippery ground'; मन्या 'thinking'; विद्या 'knowledge'; सुत्या [[6.1.71]] 'extraction of <i>soma</i> juice, parturition'; शय्या 'bed'; भृत्या 'wages, service'; इत्या 'a litter, palanquin'.\n\nHere a question arises as regards भृ. By rule [[3.1.112]], भृ would have taken क्यप्, and we could have got the form भृत्या by that rule also. But the भृत्या formed under that rule would not have denoted an appellative which the present rule does. It would be said that rule [[3.1.112]] when it used the words असञ्ज्ञायां, was rather too wide, for क्यप् does come in denoting सञ्ज्ञा in feminine nouns by the present rule; so that the word असञ्ज्ञायां there, must be qualified by the phrase, 'except in the feminine'. The test whether rule 112, is too widely worded or not, has been made to hinge on the forming of the term भार्या meaning 'wife'. This word is formed by the affix ण्यत् to the exclusion of क्यप् ।\n\nसञ्ज्ञायां पुंसि दृष्टत्वा न ते भार्या प्रसिध्यति ।\nस्त्रियां भावाधिकारोऽस्ति नेन भार्या प्रसिध्यति ॥\n\nThe word भावाधिकारः is explained by the author of <i>Kasika</i> as भावव्यापारो, वाच्यत्वेन विवक्षितः, नतु शास्त्रीयोऽधिकारः।",
    "33100": "By the force of the word च we draw the affix क्यप् into this <i>sutra</i>, and by the process called योगविभाग we can split up this aphorism into two :-\n\n(1) कृञः 'after the root कृ there is the affix क्तिन्'\n\n(2) श च 'and the affix श as well as क्यप्'. Thus क्रिया, कृत्वा [[6.1.71]] and कृतिः । When the affix श is added, the root assumes the form क्रिय by [[3.1.67]].",
    "33101": "The word is thus formed : इष् + श = इच्छ् + अ = इच्छा. The यक् ordained by [[3.1.67]] is not added, this is the irregularity.\n\nVart:- The following words are also irregularly formed :- परिसर्या 'perambulation'; परिचर्या 'attendance, service'; मृगया 'hunting'; अटाट्य 'the habit of roaming about as a religious mendicant'.\n\nVart:- From the root जागृ we have either जागरा or जागर्या 'waking'. The first is formed by the affix अ, the latter by श which brings in यक् (III. I. 67).",
    "33102": "The verbs that end in an affix are derivative roots, such as Desideratives, Causatives, Intensives and Denominatives. Though taking affixes, they are called धातु [[3.1.32]], after these verbs the affix अ is used in forming the feminine noun.\n\nThus कृ + सन् = चिकीर्ष् 'to wish to do'; this is a Derivative root; after this root चिकीर्ष्, we add अ । Thus चिकीर्ष् + अ [[6.4.48]] = चिकीर्ष । Then we add टाप् by (IV. 1. 4.) and get चिकीर्षा 'the desire to do'; so also जिहीर्षा 'the desire to take'; पुत्रीया 'the desire to be like a son'; पुत्रकाम्या 'desire of a son'; लोलूया 'much cutting'; कण्डूया 'itch'. The <i>sutra</i> is also found as अः प्रत्ययात् ।",
    "33103": "This debars क्तिन् । Thus कुण्डा 'an adulteress'; हुण्डा 'a tigress'; ईहा 'effort'; उहा 'supplying an ellipsis'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which has a prosodially heavy vowel'? Observe भक्ति devotion'. Why do we say 'which ends in a consonant'? Observe नीति 'polity'.",
    "33104": "Thus जॄष् has an indicatory ष्, the real root being जॄः । From it we have जरा 'old age' [[7.4.16]]; त्रपुष्--त्रपा 'bashfulness'.\n\nSo also from verbs of <i>Bhidadi</i> class we have भिदा 'breaking'; in the alternative we have भित्तिः । So also छिदा 'cutting'; छित्तिः 'cutting'; आरा 'a knife, an iron instrument'; आर्तिः 'distress'; धारा 'a stream'; धृतिः । The list of <i>Bhidadi</i> verbs will not be found given in one place in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>. They have been collected from different <i>Ganas</i>, and are the following:-\n\nभिदा, छिदा, विदा, क्षिपा, गुहा (गिर्योषध्योः), श्रद्धा, मेधा, गोधा, आरा, हारा, कारा, क्षिया, भारा, धारा, लेखा, रेखा, चूडा, पीडा, वपा, वसा, मृजा, सृजा, कृपा, (क्रपेः सम्प्रसारणं च)॥",
    "33105": "The force of च is to include the affix युच् into this <i>sutra</i> (see III. 3. 107). All these verbs belong to the <i>Churadi</i> or 10th class, and would have exclusively taken युच् by [[3.3.107]]. \n\nThus चिन्ता 'thought'; पूजा 'worship'; कथा 'narration'; कुम्बा 'a covering', 'a thick petticoat'; चर्च्चा 'recitation'.\n\nWhen the affix is युच्, the forms are चिन्तना &c. (VII. I. I).",
    "33106": "This supersedes क्तिन्. Thus प्रदा, प्रधा, उपदा, उपधा, &c.\n\nVart:- For the purposes of this rule the particles श्रत् and अन्तर् should be treated like <i>upasargas</i>. Thus श्रद्धा 'faith' अन्तर्द्धा [[1.4.59]].",
    "33107": "This excludes the affix अ (III. I. 102). Thus कृ + णिच् = कारि; कारि + युच् = कारणा (the इ is elided by [[6.4.51]]) 'the causing to do'; हारणा 'the causing to take'; आसना 'the sitting'; श्रन्थना 'the loosening'. How do we get the form आस्या ? It is the feminine of आस्य formed by adding ण्यत् to the root आस् by [[3.1.124]]. Is not that rule made non-applicable by rule [[3.1.94]], which declares that वाऽसरूप rule does not apply to Feminine affixes? Yes, that is, however, not total exclusion. The phrase अस्त्रियाम् in (III 1. 94) is to be interpreted thus:-  \"Non-uniform affixes prohibit each other, when they belong to the class of affixes especially ordained for the feminine nouns; such as the affix क्तिन् [[3.3.9]], क्यप् [[3.3.98]], अ [[3.3.102]]: That is to say, an <i>utsarga</i>-feminine affix will be always superseded by an <i>apavada</i>-feminine affix; but a feminine affix in general will not supersede another affix which is not enjoined in the feminine gender especially. In other words, feminine affixes inter se supersede each other totally, but not so with regard to general कृत् affixes\". Now by the present <i>sutra</i> the root आस् takes युच्; this totally excludes other feminine affixes like अ [[3.1.102]]; but it does not exclude the non-feminine affix ण्यत् ।\n\nThe root श्रन्थि taken here belongs to the <i>Kryadi</i> class, meaning 'to loosen' and is not the श्रन्थ of <i>Churadi</i> class, for the latter would be included, as a matter of course, by belonging to the <i>Churadi</i> class which class of verbs take the affix णिच् ।\n\nVart:- The verbs घट्ट 'to move', वन्द 'to praise', and विद 'to feel', should also be enumerated, as taking युच्. Thus घट्टना 'shaking', वन्दना 'praising', वेदना 'knowledge, feeling, pain'. The verb घट्ट here belongs to the <i>Tudadi</i> class, and means 'to move' and not घट्ट of the <i>Churadi</i> class, for that is already included by being णिजन्त ।\n\nVart:- The affix युच् comes after इष् when it does not mean 'to desire'. Thus अध्येषणा 'solicitation'; अन्वेषणा 'the searching after'.\n\nVart:— So also optionally when इष् takes the <i>upasarga</i> परि; as, पर्येषणा or परीष्टिः 'investigation by reasoning'.",
    "33108": "This debars क्तिन् and all the rest. By using the word आख्या in the <i>sutra</i> it is meant that the word so formed by this affix should be the appellation of the disease. The word 'diversely' shows the usual licence in the application of all the rules of grammar. Thus प्रच्छर्द्दिका (VII. I. 1) 'vomiting'; प्रवाहिका 'diarrhea'; विवर्चिका 'itch, scab'. Sometimes this affix does not apply; as शिरोर्त्तिः 'head-ache'.\n\nVart:- The affix <i>nvul</i> is employed also in simply pointing out the meaning of the roots; thus, आशिका 'to enjoy', शायिका 'lie down' &c.\n\nVart:- The affixes इक् and श्तिप् (that is शप् and तिप्) are also employed in merely pointing out the roots; as भिदिः, छिदिः, पचतिः &c. The constant use of these affixes is to be found in these very <i>sutras</i>. In the aphorisms the roots are exhibited in various ways; thus in <i>sutra</i> 49 of this chapter we have the root श्रि and यु exhibited as श्रयतिः and यौतिः । These latter forms indicating nothing more than the simple roots. So also, see [[8.4.17]]; [[6.4.49]].\n\nVart:- The affix कार is employed in merely pointing out letters; as ककारः means 'the letter क'; so also अकारः 'the letter अ'; इकारः 'the letter इ'.  \n\nVart:- The affix इफ is employed in pointing out the letter र; as रेफ ।\n\nVart:- The affix छ् comes after the word नत्वर्थ in merely pointing it out, and there is elision of the final अ; as मत्वर्थीयः ।\n\nVart:- The affix इञ् comes after the verbs  अज् & c; as आजिः, आतिः, आदिः ।\n\nVart:- The affix इक् comes after the verbs  कृष् & c; as, कृषिः, किरिः, &c.",
    "33109": "As उद्दालकपुष्पभञ्जिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which <i>uddalaka</i> flowers are broken or crushed'. वरणपुष्पप्रवाहिका 'a sort of game'; आभ्यूषखादिका; आचोषखादिका; शालभञ्जिका; तालभञ्जिका ।",
    "33110": "The word परिप्रश्न means 'question' and आख्यान means 'answer'; in the <i>sutra</i>, in making the compound of these words, the logical sequence is not observed. The compound आख्यानपरिप्रश्न may, however, be justified on the ground that in a Compound a word consisting of smaller number of syllables should stand first (II. 2. 34,) and hence <i>akhyana</i> is put first.\n\nThe force of च is to draw the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word ण्वुल् from the last into this. By the word 'optionally', it is meant that those affixes which would otherwise present themselves from the subsequent rules, should also be applied; thus: Q.—कां त्वं कारिमकार्षीः 'What work did you do'? A.—सर्वां कारिमकार्षम् 'I did all work'. Optionally we may have instead of कारि the following also. Q.—कां कारिकां, कृत्यां, कृतिं, क्रियां, अकार्षीः A.— सर्वां कारिकां or कृत्यां or कृतिं or क्रियां अकार्षम् । Similarly, Q.—कां गणिं (गणनां, गणिकां &c.) अजीगणः A.— सर्वाङ्गणिं &c. अजीगणम्. So also कां याजिम् or याजिकाम्; कां याचिम् or याचिकां &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'in question and answer'? Observe कृतिः and हृतिः ।",
    "33111": "The word पर्याय means turn or order of succession; अर्ह means worthy of respect; ॠणं means debt owed to another; and उत्पत्ति means birth or production. This rule supersedes क्तिन् and other affixes. Thus: (1) भवतः शयिका 'your turn of sleeping'; भवतोऽग्रग्रासिका 'your turn of eating first'. (2) अर्हति भवानिक्षुभक्षिकाम् 'you deserve to have a meal of sugar and molasses'. (3) इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि 'thou owest me a meal of sugar and molasses'; ओदनभोजिकां 'a meal of rice'; पयः पायिकां 'a drink of milk'. (4) इक्षुभक्षिका मे उदपादि ।\n\nThe word 'optionally' is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also; as चिकीर्षोत्पद्यते ।\n\nThe forms given by ण्वुल् and ण्वुच् are the same, the difference is only in the accent. (VI. 1. 193,) and [[6.1.163]].",
    "33112": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'optionally' does not extend to this aphorism. The word आक्रोश means to curse. This supersedes the affixes क्तिन् &c. Thus अकरणिस्ते वृषल भूयात् 'may failure be to thee, O sinner'! तस्याकरणिरेवास्तु 'may he be disappointed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to curse'? Observe अकृतिस्तस्य कटस्य 'the non-making of his mat'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when नञ् is in composition'? Observe सृतिस्ते वृषल भूयात् 'may death be to thee, O! sinner'!",
    "33113": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrases 'when denoting action' and 'when the relation of the word formed to its parent verb is not that of an agent', which began with <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.18]] and [[3.3.19]], does not extend to this <i>sutra</i> or further. By saying 'diversely' we mean that they occur in other places than those where ordained by the rules. Thus the <i>kritya</i> affixes are ordained to come when 'act' or 'object' is to be expressed, but they come also when the <i>karaka</i> is other than the objective. Thus स्नानीयं चूर्णम् 'powder for bathing'; दानीयो ब्राह्मणः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> to whom a donation is to be made'. In the first of these examples the 'powder' is the 'instrument' expressible by the 3rd. case, and in the second the '<i>Brahmana</i>' is the recipient expressible by the fourth case; so that in both cases the affix is applied without any express rule.\n\nSimilarly, ल्युट् is ordained to come in denoting instrument, location, and a verbal noun [[3.3.115]] and [[3.3.117]]. But it is applied in other senses also. Thus राजभोजनाः शालयः 'halls for the eating of kings'; राजाच्छादनानि वासांसि 'dresses to be worn by the king'.\n\nBy using the word 'diversely', even the <i>krit</i> affixes are applied in places other than those expressly ordained. Thus, पादाभ्याम् ह्रियते = पादहारकः । गले चोप्यते = गलेचोपकः । For accent see [[6.2.150]].",
    "33114": "These are neuter abstract nouns: thus, हसितम् 'laugh'; जल्पितं 'speech'; शायितं 'sleeping'. So also गतं, सहितं &c.",
    "33115": "Thus हसनं छात्रस्य 'the laughter of the student'; शोभनं 'beauty'; जल्पनं 'speech'; शयनं 'sleep'; आसनम् 'seat'.\n\nThe separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, in which it might well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>lyut</i> only runs, and not that of क्त ।",
    "33116": "This <i>sutra</i> is thus translated by Bohtlingk:-\"The affix ल्युट् comes in connection with an object, when through the contact with that, the agent of the action feels a lively pleasure\". Though the affix <i>lyut</i> would have presented itself by the last aphorism, under the circumstances mentioned in this <i>sutra</i>, the framing of this <i>sutra</i>, is really for the purpose of teaching, that the compound so formed is a नित्य or invariable compound i. e. a compound which cannot be analysed into its component members:--for every उपपद compound is a नित्य compound. [[2.2.19]] Thus पयः पानंसुखं 'the pleasure of drinking milk'; ओदनभोजनं सुखं 'the pleasure of eating rice'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word in construction is in the accusative case'? Observe तूलिकाया उत्थानं सुखं 'rising from a bed of down is pleasant'. Here there is no compounding as the <i>upapada</i> तूलिका is in the ablative case.\n\nWhy do we say 'from the contact'? Observe अग्निकुण्डस्योपासनं सुखं 'it is pleasure to sit near by a fire-hearth'. Here there being no contact between 'fire' and 'body', there is no compounding.\n\nWhy do we say 'to the agent'? Observe गुरोः स्नापनं सुखं 'to the teacher it is pleasure, when he is made to bathe'. Here the word गुरुः is not the agent, but the object of the verb स्नापयति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'corporally'? Observe पुत्रस्य परिष्वञ्जनं सुखम् 'embracing of the son is a pleasure'. Here the pleasure is a mere mental satisfaction and not a physical one.\n\nWhy do we say 'a pleasant sensation'? Observe कण्टकानां मर्दनं दुःखम् 'it is painful to rub thorns'. In all the above counter-examples there is no compounding; see [[2.2.19]] and the connected <i>sutras</i>.",
    "33117": "Thus इध्मप्रव्रश्चनः 'an axe' (lit. an instrument for cutting wood); '<i>palasa</i>-cutter'; गोदोहनी 'milk-pail' (a vessel into which milk is milked); so also सक्तुधानी । In other words, this affix expresses also the idea of the instrumental case (a tool), and of the locative case (a repository).",
    "33118": "The force of the word प्रायेण 'generally' is to show that this rule is not a universal rule. Thus दन्तच्छदः 'the lip'. छादि 'to cover' + घ [[6.4.96]] = छद lit. 'that by which the teeth are covered'; so also उरच्छद 'a breast plate'; घटः । These denote instruments.\n\nSo also in denoting 'location'. Thus आ + कृ + घ = आकरः 'a mine', so named because men work (<i>akurvanti</i>) in it, आलयः 'a house' that in which men settle down.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the masculine gender'? Observe प्रसाधनम् 'a comb'; (lit. that by which men decorate). Here the affix is <i>lyut</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the complete word so formed is merely an appellative'? Observe प्रहरणो दण्डः 'the beating stick'.\n\nThe indicatory घ् is merely qualifying; for the application of <i>sutra</i> (VI. 4. 96.) by which after the causative छादि, when घ is added, the long आ is shortened.",
    "33119": "These words are irregularly formed by the affix घ with the same force as in the last aphorism. This is an <i>apavada</i> or exception to rule [[3.3.121]], by which after roots ending in consonants, the affix घञ् is added. Thus गोचरः 'pasturage', (lit. that in which the cows graze); सञ्चरः 'a passage', (lit. through which they move ); वहः 'a vehicle' (lit. by which men are carried); व्रजः 'a cow-pen' (by which they go); व्यजः 'a fan' (by which they move the air); the anomaly in this consists in not replacing the अज् of व्यज् (वि + अज्) by the substitute वी as required by <i>sutra</i> [[2.4.56]]; आपण 'a market' (lit. that in which men come and traffic); निगमः 'the <i>Veda</i>', 'a market' (that into which they enter).\n\nThe force of the word च in the aphorism is to include other words also, which have not been already mentioned. Thus कषः, निकषः 'a touch-stone', (lit. that on which they rub).",
    "33120": "This supersedes घ । The ञ् is indicatory and causes the <i>vriddhi</i> of ॠ [[7.2.115]] and is also for the sake of regulating the accent [[6.1.195]], [[6.1.197]]. The indicatory घ् is useful in the subsequent aphorism where it changes the palatals into gutturals. Thus अवतारः 'the descent (or incarnation of a diety); अवस्तारः 'a screen round a tent'.\n\nHow do we apply अवतार also in phrases like अवतारो नद्याः 'the descent of rivers', for here the word <i>avatara</i> is not an appellative? This use is also allowed, because the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word प्राय is understood here also; so that those words <i>avatara</i> &c. may be employed in senses other than appellative.",
    "33121": "The whole of the phrase within brackets is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.118]]. This excludes घ. Thus  लेखः 'a writing' (that in which something is inscribed); वेदः 'the <i>Veda</i>' (that by which all is known); वेषः 'dress' (that which is entered into); बन्धः 'obstruction'; मार्गः 'a way' (that on which they seek); अपामार्गः 'a plant' (that by which disease or the like is cleared away); रामः '<i>Rama</i>' (i. e. in which the devout delight).",
    "33122": "These words are formed by adding the affix घञ् to the exclusion of घ which would have come by rule [[3.3.118]]. All these words are derived from roots which end in vowels. Thus अधि + इ + घञ् = अध्यायः 'a chapter or book' (lit. that in which they read); नी--न्यायः 'logic, justice', (lit. that by which men are lead); उत्-यु--उद्यावः 'mixture' (lit. that in which they blend); सम्-हृ--संहारः 'destruction' (lit. by which they are destroyed); आ-धृ-आधारः 'support' (lit. in which anything is held); आ-वि--आवायः = आवयन्ति अस्मिन् ।\n\nThe force of च is to include others not enumerated above; as, अवहारः ।",
    "33123": "The word is thus formed: उत् + अञ्च + घञ् = उदङ्कः 'a vessel'.\n\nWould not the affix घञ् have come by <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.121]], why then this aphorism? This is made a separate aphorism in order to prohibit the application of the affix, where the word to be formed means 'water'.\n\nThus तैलोदङ्कः 'a leathern vessel for oil'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not referring to 'water'? Observe उदकोदञ्चनः 'a bucket for drawing water' (उद् + अञ्च + ल्युट्).\n\nWhy do not we give the counter-example by adding the affix घ to the root उदञ्च्? Because the form evolved by applying घ, would be the same in every respect as that evolved by घञ्; even the accent would be the same. For by <i>sutra</i> [[6.2.144]], the <i>udatta</i> accent, in the case of घञ्, will fall on the final.",
    "33124": "The word is thus formed in the sense of instrument. आ + नो + घञ् = आनायः 'a net' (by which they are caught); as आनायो मत्स्यानां 'a net for fish'; आनायो मृगाणाम् 'a net for wild deer &c'.",
    "33125": "The affix घञ् has been read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of the word च । Thus आखानः or आखनः 'a spade, a hoe'.\n\nVart:- The affix ड also comes in this sense after the verb खन्. Thus आखन् + ड = आखः 'a spade'. The indicatory ड् showing that the final portion called टि should be elided.\n\nVart:- The affix डर also comes in the same sense; as आखरः 'a spade'.\n\nVart:- So also the affix इक्ः; as आखनिकः 'a spade'.\n \nVart:- So too the affix इकवक as आखनिकवकः 'a spade'.",
    "33126": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrase 'when related as instrument or location' ceases with this aphorism. The word कृच्छ्र means heavy, and दुर् has the force of conveying that sense. The word अकृच्छ्र means 'light, easy'; and the words ईषत् and सु convey that sense. Thus ईषत्करो भवता कटः 'a mat is made easily by you'; so also दुष्करः 'made with difficulty'; सुकरः 'made with ease'. Similarly ईषद्भोजः 'eating pleasantly'; दुर्भोजः and सुभोजः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'after ईषत् &c'.? See कृच्छ्रेण कार्यः कटः 'the mat which is made with difficulty'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning 'hard or light'? Observe ईषत्कार्यं 'a small work'.\n\nOf the affix खल्, the letter ख and ल् are indicatory; ख causing the insertion of a nasal (technically called मुम् augment, [[6.3.67]]); and ल् regulates the accent [[6.1.196]]. The augment मुम् will be added in the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, the ख thus having no work in this <i>sutra</i>.",
    "33127": "Thus ईषदाढ्यं भवं 'being enriched easily'; दुराढ्यं भवम् 'to be enriched with difficulty'; स्वाढ्यङ्करो देवदत्तो भवता '<i>Devadatta</i> can be made rich by you easily'.\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the agent and object in composition should be, as if they ended in the affix च्वि [[5.4.50]]. Compare [[3.2.56]] and (III. 2. 57.) &c. Therefore we do not have it here स्वाढ्येन भूयते or आढ्येन सुभूयते ॥",
    "33128": "The word ईषद् &c. are to be read into this <i>sutra</i>, not so the words कर्तृकर्मणा &c. This supersedes the affix खल्. Thus ईषत्पानः सोमो भवता 'the <i>soma</i> juice can be lightly drunk by you'; दुष्पानः 'difficult to be drunk'; सुपानः 'easy to be drunk'. ईषद्दानो गौर्भवता 'the cow can be given with ease by you'; दुर्दानः सुदानः &c.",
    "33129": "This debars the affix खल्. Thus सूपसदनोऽग्निः । सूपसदनमन्तरिक्षम् । See T.S. 7. 5. 20. I",
    "33130": "Thus सुदोह नाम कृणोद् ब्रह्मणे गां; so also सुवेद नाम कृणोद् ब्रह्मणे गां ॥ (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Veda</i>. X. 112. 8).\n\nVart:- In the modern Sanskrit, the affix '<i>yuch</i>' comes after the verbs, आस्, युध्, दृश्, धृष्, and मृष्; as दुःशासनः '<i>Duhsasana</i>'; दुर्योधनः '<i>Duryodhana</i>'; दुर्दर्शनः, दुर्द्धर्षणः and दुर्मर्षणः ।",
    "33131": "The words समीप and सामीप्य are the words with the same signification, the latter being derived from the first by adding the affix ष्यङ्. This affix is added with a self-descriptive force, without making any modification in the meaning. We learn thus incidentally from <i>Panini</i>'s using the word सामीप्य, that the affix ष्यङ् also comes with a self -descriptive (<i>svartha</i>) force, and the words चातुर्वर्ण्यः &c. are thus formed.\n\nThe affixes which begin with <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.123]] (वर्तमाने लट्) and end with (III. 3. I) (उणादय बहुलं,) are affixes which come in denoting the present time. These affixes come also with the force of the past or future time, when the sense is that the action has just taken place, or will immediately take place. Thus, to the question कदा देवदत्ताऽगतोसि 'when didst thou come <i>Devadatta</i>', it may, be replied, either अयमागच्छामि 'I come now', or आगच्छन्तमेव मां विद्धि 'know me even to have come'; or अयमागमम् 'I have now come'; or एषोस्म्यागतः 'I have come now'. So also to the question कदा देवदत्त गमिष्यसि 'when will you go <i>Devadatta</i>', it may be replied, either एष गच्छामि 'I go now' or गच्छन्तमेव मां विद्धि or एष गमिष्यामि or गन्तास्मि &c.\n\nThe phrase 'in like manner' (वत्) has been employed to indicate complete resemblance; that is to say, with whatever qualifications, the affixes have been enjoined to denote present time, namely, with whatever bases (प्रकृति), and words in compositions (उपपद), and restrictive significations (उपाधि), certain affixes have been enjoined;-the same affixes under those conditions and those circumstances, only will denote also immediate future and recent past. Thus शानन् by rule [[3.2.128]] comes after the <i>prakritis</i> पू and यज् in forming present participles; this affix, to denote past and future, must come only after पू and यज्, and so on. Thus पवमानः, यजमानः, अलङ्करिष्णुः [[3.2.136]] &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'not remote from the present, (सामीप्य)'? This rule will not apply when distant future or distant past is intended to be expressed. As परुद् अगच्छत् पाटलिपुत्रम् 'he went day before yesterday to <i>Pataliputra</i>'; वर्षेण गमिष्यति 'he will go in a year'.\n\nOne may say that \"the word गच्छामि can denote by itself nothing but the present tense, and it is because it occurs in a sentence in connection with other qualifying words, that it is made to denote any other time; and it is a well-known fact that a tense which a sentence as a whole may indicate, has no bearing on the question as to what tense a verb must take, when we are preparing it for taking a grammatical tense; and hence the present <i>sutra</i> is superfluous\". To such we reply that the present <i>sutra</i> and those that follow are not meant for those who know the proper idioms of Sanskrit language; but for those only who do not know this.\n\nDr. Bohtlingk translates this <i>sutra</i> thus:-- 'Whatever is near to the present time, may be expressed as a present tense'.",
    "33132": "The word 'optionally' is understood here also. The phrase 'not remote from the present' is not valid in this aphorism. The word आशंसा means the wish or expectation of getting an object not yet obtained, and consequently this can refer only to future time. The force of च is to draw the word वर्त्तमानवत् from the last <i>sutra</i> in this aphorism. This <i>sutra</i> has been thus put by Mr. <i>Apte</i>:--\"When hope is expressed in a conditional form, the Aorist (लुङ्), the Present, or Simple Future is used in both the clauses to denote a future time. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदगमत् or आगतः, or आगच्छति or आगमिष्यति वा एते व्याकरणमध्यगीष्महि, or अधीतवन्तः or अधीमहे or अध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come, we should read grammar'.\n\nThis construction is possible only when the past tense is expressed by लुङ् (Aorist); and not by लङ् or लिट्. For लुङ् denotes past time in general, while लङ् and लिट् denote particular forms of past time; (see [[3.2.110]]), [[3.2.111]] and [[3.2.115]]. The phrase भूतवत् making an analogy with time in general, will not therefore, refer to लिट् or लङ् which refer to past time in special.\n\nWhy say 'when hope is expressed'? Observe आगमिष्यति 'he will come'.",
    "33133": "This supersedes the last rule by which Aorist could also have been employed. By the present rule the Second Future can only be employed. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेत्क्षिप्रमागमिष्यति (or उपाध्यायश्चेदागतः--<i>Apte</i>.) क्षिप्रं व्याकरणमध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come soon, we shall soon learn grammar'.\n\nBy force of the word वचन in the aphorism, we take the synonyms of क्षिप्र also, such as शीघ्रं, आशु, त्वरितम्, &c. \n\nAn objector might say, \"the use of the word लृट् in the <i>sutra</i> is redundant; for Future tense is the natural tense to be used, whenever hope is indicated. <i>Sutra</i> [[3.3.132]] was merely an exception to this rule; so that the present <i>sutra</i> re-enacting the general rule, ought to have been worded thus;-- न क्षिप्रवचने 'not so when a word expressing quickness is employed'; for such a rule debarring the past tenses given by [[3.3.132]], would have, of necessity, given scope to the Future tense which is the natural tense to express hope\". To them we say, that there are two future tenses, लृट् and लुट् । By specifying लृट् we mean that लुट् should not be employed even where it would otherwise have come, such as in the following:- श्वः क्षिप्रमध्येष्यामहे 'to-morrow we shall learn soon'.",
    "33134": "This is also an <i>apavada</i> of rule [[3.3.132]], and teaches the employment of the Potential with a future force. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेद्, आशंसेयुक्तोऽधीयीय 'if the teacher will come, I hope, you will study with diligence'. This being a subsequent rule, will apply even when the words expressive of 'quickness' are in composition. Thus आशंसे क्षिप्रमधीयीय 'I hope, you will learn soon'. So also, अवकल्पये युक्तोऽधीयीय, &c.",
    "33135": "The affixes लङ् (Imperfect Past) and लुट् (First Future), have been ordained to come, when past time not belonging to the current day, and future time not belonging to the current day, are respectively indicated. The present <i>sutra</i> prohibits these two affixes. The word क्रियाप्रबन्धः means 'performing an action with continuity'; and सामीप्य means 'not remoteness of time, immediateness, without the intervention of anything of the same genus'. Thus यावज्जीवं भृशमन्नमदात् (not अददात्) 'he gave food throughout his life'; or भृशमन्नं दास्यति 'he will give much food'. यावज्जीवं पुत्रोप्यापिपत् 'throughout his life he taught', or यावज्जीवमध्यापयिष्यति  'throughout his life he will teach'. In both these cases the Aorist and the Second Future are used instead of the Imperfect and the First Future.\n\nSo also when recent past or immediate future is meant, the Aorist and the Second Future are employed, instead of the Imperfect and the First Future. Thus येयं पौर्णमास्यतिक्रान्ता, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधित or सोमेनायष्ठ or गामदित 'during the full-moon that has just past, the teacher consecrated the fire, or performed the <i>soma</i>-sacrifice or gave a cow'. Here the Aorist is for the Imperfect. येयममावास्याऽऽगामिनी, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधास्यते or सोमेन यक्ष्यते, or स गां दास्यते 'on the next new-moon day, the teacher will perform the fire-sacrifice or the <i>soma</i>-sacrifice, or he will give a cow'. Here the Second Future is employed instead of the First Future.\n\nThe double negative न अनद्यतन 'not non-today' implies the proper corresponding tenses which indicate <i>adyatana</i>.",
    "33136": "The phrase नानद्यतनवत् is valid in this <i>sutra</i> also. The two conditions of the last aphorism, namely, 'continuity of action' and 'immediateness', however, do not apply here. Thus योऽयमध्वागन्तव्य आपाटलिपुत्रात्तस्य यदवरं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्ष्यामहे, तत्र सक्तून्पास्यामः 'on this side of the road from the city of <i>Kosambi</i> to the city of <i>Pataliputra</i>, there we will eat rice, and there we will drink <i>saktu</i>'.\n\nWhy do we say 'in denoting future time'? Observe योऽयमध्वागत आपाटलिपुत्रात् तस्य कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्यैमहि 'on this side of the road that leads from the city of <i>Kosambi</i> to the city of <i>Pataliputra</i>, we read together &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when signifying limit'? Observe योऽयमध्वानिरवधिकगन्तव्यस्तस्य यदवरं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे, सक्तून् पातास्मः । Here the First Future is employed.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word अवर is in construction'? Observe योऽयमध्वागन्तव्य आपाटलिपुत्रात् तस्य यत्परं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे &c.\n \nThe examples of limit given in this aphorism, refer to local limit; in the subsequent <i>sutras</i> examples will be given as to the limit of time and some difference will be observed therein.",
    "33137": "The whole of the last <i>sutra</i> should be read into this. The difference between this and the last <i>sutra</i> is, that <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.136]] referred both to the limit of space and time, while <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.137]] refers to the limit of time only; moreover with regard to time, there is exception with regard to the portions of day and night. The <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>, the separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, is for the sake of subsequent aphorisms. Thus योऽयं संवत्सर आगामी तत्र यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र अध्येष्यामहे 'in the month of <i>Chaitra</i>, the year after next, we shall read together'; तत्रोदनं भोक्ष्यामहे 'we shall eat rice then &c'.\n\nThis construction is, of course, only valid in denoting future time, otherwise not. Therefore not here: योऽयं वत्सरोऽतीतस्तस्य यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्यैमहि 'in the month of <i>Chaitra</i>, the year before last, we read together'; तत्रौदनमभुञ्जमहि 'we ate together &c'.\n\nWhy do we say 'limit'? Observe योऽयं निरवधिकः काल आगामी तस्य यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्येतास्महे--तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे ।\n\nThe limit must be 'on this side i. e. अवर side'. With the वर side limit, this rule will not apply. With the word पर, this construction is optional. See the next <i>sutra</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not divisions of day and night'? There are three sorts of counter-examples in this case; as, योऽयं मास आगामी तस्य योऽवरः पञ्चदशरात्रः or योऽयं  त्रिंशद्रात्र आगामी तस्य योऽवरोर्द्धमासः or योऽयं त्रिंशदहोरात्र आगामी तस्य योऽवरः पञ्चदशरात्रस्तत्र युक्ता अध्येतास्महे तत्र सक्तून् पातास्मः । Here <i>Lut</i>; or First Future has been employed and not the Second Future.",
    "33138": "The whole of the last aphorism must be read into this: The <i>sutra</i> will then stand thus: \"The Second and the First Futures are optionally both employed in denoting future time, not belonging to the current day, instead of the First Future alone, when the word पर is used signifying a limit of time on that side of a fixed period, provided that this word does not give the sense of day or night\".\n\nThis rule allows an option when the time refers to the पर side of a starting limit. Thus योऽयं संवत्सर आगामी तस्य यत् परमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्येष्यामहे or अध्येतास्महे 'we will read together in the month of <i>Chaitra</i>, the year after next'.\n\nAll the counter-examples given under the last aphorism, are also valid here by substituting the word पर instead of अवर.",
    "33139": "The words 'in denoting future time' are here. The reasons for affix लिङ् are such as cause and effect &c. mentioned in <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.156]] and [[3.3.157]] &c. The लृङ् is called the conditional tense. \"It comes in the conditional sentences in which the non-performance of the action is implied; or where the falsity of the antecedent is implied as a matter of fact. It usually corresponds to the English Plu perfect Conditional, and must, in Sanskrit, be used in both the antecedent and the consequent clauses\".-- <i>Apte</i>'s Guide.\n\nThus सुवृष्टिश्चेदभविष्यत् तदा सुभिक्षमभविष्यत् 'if there had been good rain, then there would have been plenty of food; or if there were to be good rain then there would be plenty of food'. It is implied that there was not good rain, nor consequent plenty: or that the occurrence of good rain is dubious, and the desirable consequence equally so.\n\nSo also here, दक्षिणेन चेदायास्यन्न शकटं पर्याभविष्यत् 'if he were to go by the right side, the carriage would not be upset'; यदि कमलकम् आह्वास्यन् न शकटं पर्याभविष्यत् 'if he were to call <i>Kamalaka</i> (which he will not), the carriage would not be upset'; आभोक्ष्यत भवान् घृतेन यदि मत्समीपम् आगमिष्यत् 'you would eat food with clarified butter, if you (were to) come to me (but you will not come)'.\n\nAll these sentences refer to future time. The non-upsetting is a future contingency and is an effect the cause of which is the 'calling of <i>Kamalaka</i>'. The speaker--having apprehended the cause and effect, and having also learned from other sources that such an effect will not take place, that is to say, that <i>Kamalaka</i> will not be called, and the carriage will be upset-- has employed this conditional tense to express his idea. The whole sentence यदि कमलकम्  &c. really gives this sense:-That both actions, 'the calling' and 'the non-upsetting', which are subjects of a future time, and which are related as cause and effect, will not be completed; that neither <i>Kamalaka</i> will be called, nor the impending fate averted from the carriage. The <i>sutra</i> may also be thus rendered according to Professor Bohtlingk:- In a conditional sentence, which would require a Potential according to [[3.3.156]], is used, if the sense is that of Future time, the Conditional Tense, when the action is not complete.",
    "33140": "The whole of the last aphorism is understood in this. The last <i>sutra</i> enjoined लृङ् in the Future tense; this <i>sutra</i> ordains it in the Past, the Conditional tense having both these significations. The reasons for affixing लिङ् are given in <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.152]] and those that follow it. In <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.141]] and those that follow, as far as [[3.3.152]], optional rules for the employment of the Conditional tense will be given. Thus:- दृष्टो मया भवत्पुत्रोऽन्नार्थी चङ्क्रम्यमाणः अपरश्च द्विजो ब्राह्मणार्थी, यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत्, तदाऽभोक्ष्यत, न तु भुक्तवान्, अन्येन पथा स गतः । 'I saw your son, wandering about in search of food, I saw also a twice-born in search of a <i>Brahmana</i>(whom he would feast); if he (your son) had been seen by him (the twice-born), then he would have been fed; but as a matter of fact, he has not been fed, he went by a different road'.\n\nThe conditional sentence यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत् तदाऽभोक्ष्यत is employed under circumstances set out above. It refers to a past time, there is the relation of cause and effect existing, one being in search of food, and another in search of a guest to feed; and the action is not completed; both taking different roads, did not come across each other.",
    "33141": "All the words within brackets must be supplied from the previous <i>sutras</i> to complete the sense. This <i>sutra</i> consists of three words वा 'optionally', आ 'as far as' and उताप्योः (the <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.152]]). The words वा + आ + उ form वो by the rules of conjunction. The particle आ in this aphorism has the force of limit exclusive and not that of limit inclusive. The optional use of the conditional tense will be illustrated in the following aphorisms, where, in addition to the special tenses to be employed by those rules, we may employ the conditional also under those very circumstances, in the alternative, provided that the non-completion of the action is understood. Prof. Bohtlingk translates this aphorism thus: \"optionally so, in connection with उत् and अपि, the conditional tense may be employed\".",
    "33142": "The word गर्हा means 'censure', 'blame'. The affix लट् has been enjoined to come with a present signification, and would not have come to denote time in general, which, however, it does here, for here the Present tense is employed in preference to the tense required by the time of the action, which is totally excluded. Hence the present <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus अपि तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति 'even your honor sacrifices (or sacrificed or will sacrifice) to a <i>Sudra</i>'; जातु तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति गर्हामहे, अहोअन्याय्यमेतत् 'possibly your honor sacrifices for a <i>Sudra</i>'; the sense implied being that such conduct on the part of those men are blameworthy.\n\nIn the present case, there being no occasion for the application of लिङ्, of course, we cannot employ लृङ् to denote the non-completion of the action.\n \nSo also अपि or जातु जायां त्यजसि ' Fie! you abandon (or abandoned or will abandon) your wife'!",
    "33143": "The word 'censure' is understood, and by च we draw लट् from the previous <i>sutra</i> into this. By using the word 'optionally' in the aphorism, it is indicated that this rule does not exclude the application of the alternative tenses which would otherwise have been required by the time of the action. It is not total exclusion like the last. Thus कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयति or याजयिष्यति 'Indeed, how your honor can (or will) sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i>'.\n\nSo also, कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिता, अयाजयत् or याजयाञ्चकार ।\n\nHere there is an occasion for the application of the Potential mood (लिङ्); therefore when we intend to express non-completion of action in the past time, we can optionally employ the Conditional also (लृङ्). As कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् अयाजयिष्यत् or याजयेत् 'Indeed, why did your honor (attempt to) sacrifice for that <i>Sudra</i> (in vain)'.\n\nUnder similar circumstances, in denoting future time, the Conditional (लृङ्) must invariably be employed [[3.3.139]]; as, कथं धर्मम् अत्यजिष्यः 'why will you (attempt to) give up your duty'.",
    "33144": "Here also the Potential and the First Future are employed in preference to the time required by the action.\n\nThe word 'censure' is understood here; not so, however, the word 'optionally'. This excludes all other tense-affixes. The repetition of the word लिङ् in this <i>sutra</i>, is for the sake of excluding लट्, whose <i>anuvritti</i> would also have run into this <i>sutra</i>, had we taken the <i>anuvritti</i> of लिङ् from the last <i>sutra</i>, instead of repeating it. Thus कः कतरो वा हरिं निन्देत्, निन्दिष्यति वा 'who will censure <i>Hari</i>'?\n\nIn the Past tense, when the non-completion of action is implied, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्); and in the Future tense, under similar circumstances, we must employ the Conditional necessarily; as को नाम वृषलो यं तत्र भवानयाजयिष्यत् 'who is the <i>Sudra</i> for whom your honor did sacrifice (in vain)'. This <i>sutra</i> may be rendered thus also:—\" In connection with an Interrogative Pronoun, when censure is implied, may be employed the Potential or the First Future\".",
    "33145": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'censure' ceases. The word अनवक्लृप्तिः means 'impossibility, not to be believed'. The word अमर्षः means 'not endurable or not to be tolerated'. This excludes all other tenses, the Potential and the 2nd. Future coming in preference to all other tenses required by the time of the action. In the <i>Dvandva</i> Compound अनवक्लृप्त्यमर्षयोः, the word अनवक्लृप्ति ought to have stood as second member of the compound as it contains larger number of syllables than the word अमर्ष [[2.2.14]]. The non-compliance with rule (II. 2. 14.) indicates that the rule of यथासङ्ख्यं, [[1.3.10]] does not apply here, which would otherwise have applied-- the sense of the <i>sutra</i> then being 'that the Potential should be employed when the act is not likely to occur, and the 2nd. Future to be used when the act is not to be tolerated'. This is not, however, the interpretation which we should put upon the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus नावकल्पयामि, न सम्भावयामि, न श्रद्दधे, तत्र भवान् नाम वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयिष्यति 'I do not believe, or think it possible or trust that your honor sacrifices (or sacrificed or will sacrifice) for a <i>Sudra</i>'. न मर्षयामि तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयिष्यति 'I can not tolerate that your honor does (did or will) sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i>'.\n\nWhen past time together with the non-completion of the action is to be expressed, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्), but necessarily so, when Future time is to be expressed. Thus नावकल्पयामि तत्रभवान् नाम वृषलं अयाजयिष्यत् 'I do not believe that your honor did or will sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i>'.",
    "33146": "The words within brackets must be supplied from the last aphorism. The whole word किङ्किल is to be taken as an <i>upapada</i> and not the word किं and किल separately. This word expresses anger. The words having the sense of <i>asti</i> are अस्ति, भवति and विद्यते । This rule supersedes the Potential (लिङ्). Thus किङ्किल or अस्ति or भवति or विद्यते नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिष्यति, न मर्षयामि, न श्रद्दधे 'Is it possible that your honor will (or did or does) sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i> ? I cannot believe or tolerate it'.\n\nAs there is no occasion for लिङ् here, we cannot have the Conditional (लृङ्) required by rule [[3.3.141]].\n\nAnother example is न श्रद्दधे न मर्षये वा किङ्किल त्वं शूद्रान्नम् भोक्ष्यसे 'I do not believe or can tolerate that thou shouldst eat the food of <i>Sudra</i>'; अस्ति भवति विद्यते वा शूद्रीं गमिष्यसि 'Is it possible that thou shouldst go to a female <i>Sudra</i>'.",
    "33147": "This excludes the First Future or '<i>Lrit</i>'. जातु तन्न भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, or यन्नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि ।\n\nVart:- The words यदा and यदि should be enumerated along with the words जातु and यत् in this rule. As यदि or यदि वा त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देन्नावकल्पयामि न मर्षयामि 'neither do I think, nor do I tolerate that one like you should blaspheme <i>Hari</i>'.\n\nHere also when the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional (लृङ्) is necessarily employed in denoting future time, and optionally so in denoting past time. As जातु, यत्, यदा or यदि त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देत् or अनिन्दिष्यन् नावकल्पयामि, न मर्षयामि वा 'neither do I believe, nor do I tolerate that one like you did attempt to blaspheme <i>Hari</i>'. यदि सुरभिमवाप्स्यस्तन्मुखोच्छ्वासगन्धम् तव रति रभविष्यत् पुण्डरीके किमस्मिन् 'if you had felt (which you clearly have not) the fragrant smell of her breath, would you have had any liking for this lotus'?",
    "33148": "This supersedes the First Future. The separation of this aphorism from the previous one, is for the sake of the rules that follow. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not also apply here. Thus यच्च यत्र वा त्वमेवं कुर्याः न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि 'I do not think, nor can I tolerate that thou wilt do so'.\n \nThe Conditional (लृङ्) will also be employed under its own proper conditions as shown in the last aphorism.",
    "33149": "The governing force of the words <i>anavaklipti</i> and <i>amarsha</i> ceases. This debars all other tense-affixes. Thus यच्च or यत्र तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् ॠद्धौ वृद्धः सन् ब्राह्मणः, गर्हामहे, अहो अन्याय्यमेतत् 'we blame you who being an opulent, old <i>Brahmana</i> (who ought to know better) officiate as a sacrificial priest for a <i>Sudra</i>, O! It is improper'!\n\nWhen the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional tense must be employed under the rules given in [[3.3.139]]- [[3.3.140]]- [[3.3.141]]. As यच्च or यत्र त्वं हरिं निन्देः or अनिन्दिष्यः, गर्हामहे 'we censure that you should (have attempted to) blaspheme <i>Hari</i>', &c.",

Thus यच्च or यत्र तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् आश्चर्यमेतत् 'this is a wonder that you should sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i>'.\n \nWhen the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional is employed under the rules [[3.3.139]], [[3.3.140]] and [[3.3.141]]. Thus आश्चर्यमेतत् यच्च or यत्र त्वं शूद्रं याजयेः or अयाजयिष्यः 'it is a wonder that you should (have attempted to) perform a sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i>'; आश्चर्यमेतत् यच्च or यत्र त्वं शूद्रं अयाजयिष्यः 'it is a wonder that you should (hereafter attempt to) make a <i>Sudra</i> perform a sacrifice'.",
    "33151": "In all other cases, that is to say, in cases where the words यच्च or यत्र are not employed, as well as where the word यदि is not used, the First Future is used in preference to the Potential.\n\nThus आश्चर्यं, चित्रं, अद्भूतम् अन्धो नाम पर्वतमारोक्ष्यति, बधिरो नाम व्याकरणम् अध्येष्यते 'it is wonderful, strange and astonishing that the blind man should ascend a mountain, or a deaf person should read grammar'.\n\nNot so, when the word यदि is employed. Thus आश्चर्यं यदि सोऽधीयीत 'a wonder, if he study'. आश्चर्यं यदि स भुञ्जीत 'a wonder, if he eat'.\n\nAs there is, in this case, no occasion to employ the Potential, we cannot employ the Conditional as directed in <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.139]], [[3.3.140]] and [[3.3.141]].",
    "33152": "This excludes all the other tense-affixes. The meaning which is common both to उत and अपि is that of बाढम् 'assuredly, certainly, surely, really'. Thus उत कुर्यात् 'certainly he does'; अपि कुर्यात् 'assuredly he does' उताधीयीत 'certainly he studies (will study &c)'; अप्यधीयीत 'surely he studies &c'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when they mean certainly'? Observe उत दण्डः पतिष्यति 'will the stick fall'? अपि द्वारं धास्यति 'he shuts the door'. Here उत is employed in asking questions, and अपि with धा means 'to shut'. The option allowed by rule (III. 3. 141.) ceases. Hereafter the Conditional (लृङ्) must invariably be used even in indicating Past action, when action is not completed, and there is reason for the employment of लिङ्(Potential). In indicating Future time, of course, लङ् must necessarily be employed as before. Henceforward, therefore, no option is allowed, but लृङ् must be employed where <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.139]] and [[3.3.140]] require it.",

Observe कच्चिज्जीवति ते माता कच्चिज्जीवति ते पिता । माराविद त्वां पृच्छामि कच्चिज्जीवति पार्वती ॥ 'I hope thy mother is living, I hope thy father is living, I ask thee, O <i>maravid</i> ! (Parrot), I hope that <i>Parvati</i> is living'.",
    "33154": "The word लिङ् is understood here. The word सम्भावन means supposition and expectation in the power or ability of another to perform any action. This word is here qualified by the sense of the word अलं. The word अलं means 'adequate'; so that the above-mentioned सम्भावनं must be completed, full and true i.e. realised. The phrase सिद्धाप्रयोगे qualifies अलं, and means 'if the non-employment or omission of अलं is valid or unobjectionable. When is that unobjectionable, when the sense of अलं is implied by the sentence, but this word itself is not used? The Potential Mood is employed when the expectation is of the kind above described. This rule debars all other tense-affixes. Thus अपि पर्वतं शिरसा भिन्द्यात् 'l expect he will break even the hill with his head'; अपि द्रोणपाकं भुञ्जीत 'I expect you will eat away even a <i>drona</i> of cooked food'.\n\nWhy do we use the word अलं 'competent to do'? Observe, विदेशस्थायी देवदत्त प्रायेण गमिष्यति ग्रामम् 'I expect <i>Devadatta</i> who is living in a foreign country, will some day go back to his country'. Here though 'expectation' is expressed the idea conveyed by अलं, namely, the power to do something or adequacy to do is not present; and hence the Future is employed instead of the Potential.\n\nWhy do we use the phrase सिद्धाप्रयोगे 'when the actual result does not take place'? Observe, अलं देवदत्तो हस्तिनं हनिष्यति '<i>Devadatta</i> is in a position to kill the elephant, and he will carry it out also'.\n\nUnder similar circumstances, in past and future times, when non-completion of action is indicated, the Conditional tense (लृङ्) must be invariably used in preference to every other tense. Professor Bohtlingk translates the <i>sutra</i> thus: \"The Potential is employed when it is expressed that some one is believed to be capable of doing something, pre-supposing that the actual performance of the action does not take place\".",
    "33155": "The whole of the last <i>sutra</i> qualifies this <i>sutra</i>; the 'expectation' indicated here being of the kind mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i> and governed by the conditions laid down in that aphorism. The word by which an 'expectation' is expressed such as सम्भावय अपि, or अपिनाम, is called सम्भावन-वचन. This <i>sutra</i> enjoins an option where by the last aphorism, there would have been necessarily the Potential Tense. Thus सम्भावयामि भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I expect you will eat'; अवकल्पयामि भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I hope you will eat'; श्रद्दधे भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I believe you will eat'. But no option is allowed, and the Potential must necessarily be used, when the word यत् is employed. As सम्भावयामि यद् भुञ्जीत भवान् 'I expect you will eat'.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> may also be rendered thus. \"The Potential is not necessarily employed where there is in connection with it a verb in the sense of 'to hold as possible', but not when यद् is employed.\"",
    "33156": "The word हेतु means 'cause' or 'condition' and हेतुमत् means 'consequence or effect'. This supersedes all other tense-affixes; in other words, 'in conditional sentences in which one statement is made to depend upon another as its reason or ground, the Potential is used in both the antecedent and the consequent, otherwise called the protasis (हेतु) and apodosis (हेतुमत्), the former containing the condition or ground of argument, and the latter the conclusion based upon it'. Thus :- दक्षिणेन चेद्यायान्न शकटम् पर्याभवेत् 'if he go by the right side, the cart will not be upset'; यदि कमलकम् आहूयेन्न शकटम् पर्याभवेत् 'if he calls <i>Kamalaka</i>, the cart will not be upset'. Here 'going by the right side' is the protasis (हेतु), and 'not-upsetting' the apodosis (हेतुमत्).\n\nThis is an optional use of the Potential; we may use the Second Future in the alternative; thus दक्षिणेन चेद् यास्यति न शकटं पर्याभविष्यति 'if he goes by the south, the cart will not be upset'.\n\nThe word विभाषा 'optionally' used in the <i>sutra</i> immediately preceding is also understood here.\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of लिङ् could have been taken from the last aphorisms, its repetition here is for the sake of pointing out the particular time, namely, the Future, in which the Potential should be employed. Therefore it is not employed in the following sentences: हन्तीति पलायते 'he kills, therefore he flies'; वर्षति इति धावति 'it rains, therefore he runs'.\n\nIt, of course, follows that when the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional (लृङ्) should be employed, under these very circumstances. See examples under <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.139]].",
    "33157": "This supersedes all other tense-affixes. When words expressing 'wish', such as इष्, कम्, प्राथ &c, are used, the Potential or Imperative is used; thus of इच्छामि कामये or प्रार्थये भुञ्जीत भवान् or भुङ्क्तां भवान् 'I wish, desire or pray that your honor may eat'.\n\nVart:- It is only when a desire is expressed that Potential or Imperative should be employed and not merely when the verb 'to wish' or its synonyms are in composition. Therefore the Potential or Imperative are not used here: इच्छन् करोति 'wishing, he does'.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> may be rendered thus: 'In connection with a verb in the sense of 'wishing' the Potential or the Imperative may be employed.",
    "33158": "Thus इच्छति, वष्टि or वाञ्छति भोक्तुम् 'he desires to eat'; कामयते भोक्तुम् 'he wishes to eat'; पिनाकपाणिं पतिम् आप्तुम् इच्छति 'desires to obtain for her husband the <i>Pinaka</i>-handed God <i>Siva</i>'.\n\nBut why do we say 'when the agent of the Infinitive and the verb are the same'? We can not say देवदतं भोक्तुम् इच्छति यज्ञदत्तः '<i>Yajnadatta</i> wishes <i>Devadatta</i> to eat'; for here the agents of भुज् and इष् are not the same. We must say, भुञ्जानम् instead of भोक्तुम् ।\n\nWhy do not we use it here:- इच्छन् करोति 'wishing, he does'? Because the Infinitive is never found in such constructions. In other words, the Infinitive in तुम् is employed when both the verbs have the same agent.",
    "33159": "Under similar conditions, with words implying 'wish', the Potential is used in the sense of the Infinitive; Thus भुञ्जीय इति इच्छति 'he wishes that he may eat'; अधीयीयेतीच्छति 'he wishes that he will read'.\n\nWhen the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional must be employed under rule [[3.3.139]].",
    "33160": "This ordains लिङ् where there would have been otherwise लट्. Thus इच्छति or इच्छेत् 'he wishes'; वष्टि or उश्यात्; कामयते or कामयेत ।",
    "33161": "The word विधिः means 'commanding or directing a subordinate'; निमन्त्रणं means 'giving invitation'; आमन्त्रणं means 'expressing permission to do as one likes'; अधीष्ठः means 'to politely express a wish'; सम्प्रश्नः means 'a question'; and प्रार्थना means 'a prayer'.\n\nThis excludes all other tense-affixes. Thus:--\n\n(1)\tकटं कुर्यात् 'let him make the mat'; ग्रामम् भवान् आगच्छेत् 'you come to the village';\n\n(2 and 3) इह भवान् भुञ्जीत 'you will or may dine here'; इह भवान् आसीत 'here you will or may sit';\n\n(4) अधीच्छामो भवन्तं माणवकं भवानुपनयेत 'we wish that you should condescend to initiate this boy';\n\n(5) किं भो व्याकरणमधीयीय उत तर्कम् ? 'Sir, what shall I learn, the Grammar or the Logic'?\n\n(6) भवति मे प्रार्थना व्याकरणं अधीयीय 'this is my prayer that I should learn Grammar'.",
    "33162": "The Imperative Mood is employed also under the circumstances mentioned in the last aphorism. The division of this aphorism from the last, is for the sake of subsequent <i>sutras</i> in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of लोट् only runs and not those of others. Thus :--\n\n(1) कटं तावद् भवान् करोतु 'make the mat'; ग्रामं भवान् आगच्छतु ।\n\n(2 and 3) अमुत्र भवान् आस्ताम् 'there you are invited to, or you may, sit'. \n\n(4) पुत्रम्भवान् अध्यापयतु 'you will teach, I hope, the son'.\n\n(5) किं भो वेदमध्ययै उत तर्कं 'Sir what shall I learn, the Veda or the Logic'?\n\n(6) भवति मे प्रार्थना व्याकरणमध्ययै छन्दोऽध्ययै 'this is my prayer that I may learn the Grammar, or that I may learn the Prosody'.",
    "33163": "The word प्रैष means 'direction'; अतिसर्गः means 'permission to do as one likes'; प्राप्तकालः means 'arrival of appropriate occasion or time for the doing of an action'. The force of च is to introduce the word लोट् into this aphorism. Thus भवता कटः करणीयः, कर्तव्यः, or कृत्यः or कार्यः 'you must, (may, or it is proper time for you to) make the mat'.\n\nSo instead of the Passive Potential Participles, for such the <i>Kritya</i> affix [[3.1.95]] &c)) may properly be called; we may have the Imperative also. Thus करोतु कटं  'you must (may or it is the appropriate time to) make the mat'.\n \nIt might be asked 'Why the <i>kritya</i> affixes are enjoined to come with the force of direction, permission &c'. They have been ordained most generically to come in denoting action in the Abstract (भाव) and object (कर्म) and a fortiori they will come in denoting the senses of direction, permission & c; for the latter are but a species of action. If you say that लोट् being ordained in these special senses, will (on the principle, that an <i>apavada</i> or special rule excludes an <i>utsarga</i> or general rule within the jurisdiction of such special rule) exclude <i>kritya</i> affixes; we would reply, that <i>kritya</i> affixes will not be excluded, for the rule of non-uniform affixes [[3.1.94]] will apply'.\n\nTo this objection we answer 'the special mention of the word <i>kritya</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, indicates the existence of the following maxim :--\n\n'The rule of non-uniform affixes [[3.1.94]] does not necessarily apply in all cases after <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.94]] treating of primary affixes by which feminine nouns are formed'.\n\nQ.-- What is the difference between the words विधि and प्रैष ? Some say विधि means a precept enjoining something for the first time; while प्रैष means mere 'direction'.",
    "33164": "The words प्रैष &c. of the last <i>sutra</i> must be read into this. The force of च is to introduce the words कृत्या and लोट् from the last <i>sutra</i>, into this. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य भवता खलु कठः कर्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः, or भवान् खलु कटं कुर्यात (Potential) or करोतु (Imperative). 'You may make the mat after an Indian hour'; or 'you must &c', or 'it is proper time for you to make a mat just now'. Compare [[3.3.9]].",
    "33165": "This supersedes the Potential (लिङ्) and Potential Passive Participles (कृत्या). Thus ऊर्ध्वम् मुहूर्ताद् भवान् कटं करोतु स्म, ग्रामं गच्छतु स्म, माणवकमध्यापयतु स्म 'you (may, must, or it is proper time to) make the mat, or go to the village, or teach <i>Manavaka</i> just now'.",
    "33166": "The word स्म is understood here. The word अधीष्ट has already been explained in <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.161]]. This rule supersedes the Potential. Thus अङ्ग स्म राजन् माणवकमध्यापय or अङ्ग स्म राजन्नग्निहोत्रं जुहुधि 'O! King! I wish that you teach the boy or make <i>Agnihotra</i> sacrifice'.",
    "33167": "Thus कालो भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'; समयः खलु स्नानभोजने सेवितुम् 'it is time to bathe and take food'; वेला भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'. In short, Infinitive in तुमुन् may be used with words meaning 'time'; as अवसरोऽयमात्मानं प्रकाशयितुम् 'this is, indeed, the time to show myself'.\n\nWhy do not we use the Infinitive here? कालः पचति भूतानि 'time devours all creatures'. The sense of 'direction &c'. is understood in the <i>sutra</i>; so when 'direction &c' is not meant, the Infinitive will not be used.\n\nWhy do not we use the Infinitive here, कालो भोजनस्य 'proper time to eat'? Because, by the rule of non-uniform affixes [[3.1.94]], we can use also the affix ल्युट् (by which the word भोजन is formed). As we have already in <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.163]] that after <i>sutras</i> (III 1. 113) and forward, namely, in other <i>sutras</i> than those treating of feminine affixes, the rule of [[3.1.94]] may be employed as an <i>Anitya</i> or a non-universal rule.",
    "33168": "This ordains the Potential and supersedes the Infinitive in '<i>tumun</i>'. Thus कालः, समयः, वेला वा यद् भवान् भुञ्जीत 'it is time that your honor should take your meals'.",
    "33169": "The force of च is to introduce the Potential (लिङ्) into this, from the last. Thus भवता खलु कन्या वोढव्या वाह्या or वहनीया, (<i>kritya</i>); or भवान् खलु कन्यया वोढा (<i>trich</i>); or भवान् खलु कन्यां वहेत् (<i>lin</i>) 'your honor is fit to marry the girl'.\n\nWhy specifically enjoin '<i>kritya</i>' and '<i>trich</i>' in the sense of fitness? They being enjoined universally, would a fortiori, be applied when fitness is to be denoted ? Because the लिङ् being specially enjoined to denote fitness, and being an <i>Apavada</i>, would have debarred <i>kritya</i> and <i>trich</i>, which being universal affixes, would give way. Nor can we, to prevent this contingency, take shelter under rule [[3.1.94]] of 'non-uniform affixes', for we have seen that that rule is not universally valid.",
    "33170": "Thus अवश्यं कारी 'must be done'. The compounding here takes place by [[2.1.72]]. So also शतं दायी 'ought to be given a hundred'; सहस्रं दायी; निष्कं दायी &c.",
    "33171": "Thus भवता खलु अवश्यं कटः कर्त्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः or कृत्यः 'you ought to make the mat'; भवता शतं दातव्यं, देयं, &c, 'you ought to pay a hundred'.\n\nQ.-- Where is the necessity of this aphorism ? The <i>kritya</i> affixes, being enjoined universally without any limitation would, of course, come under these special circumstances also.\n\nA.-- They would be excluded by the special affix णिनि of the last <i>sutra</i>, which comes especially with the force of 'necessity' and 'obligation'.\n\nQ.-- Not so, for णिनि comes in denoting the 'agent' (कर्ता), while <i>kritya</i> denotes the 'action' (भाव) and the 'object' (कर्म); so their scope being different, how can one supersede the other ?\n\nA.-- Well, to remove this objection, some say, that <i>kritya</i> words like भव्य, गेय &c. [[3.4.68]] which especially refer to the agent, are the proper examples to be given under this aphorism; and not examples of <i>kritya</i>-formed words in general.",
    "33172": "The word 'capability' qualifies the root so that the sense of capability must be inherent in the root; Thus भवता खलु भारो वोढव्यः, वहनीयः, वाह्यः (<i>kritya</i>), or भवान् खलु भारं वहेत् 'you can carry the load'.\n\nThough <i>kritya</i>-affixes would have come in this sense, even without any special rule, for they are general affixes, their special mention in this <i>sutra</i> is to guard against their being superseded by लिङ्, for rule [[3.1.94]] is not universally valid.",
    "33173": "The word आशीस् means the wish to obtain an object which one desires, a blessing, an expression of one's good wishes. The लिङ् here referred to is what is known as the आशीर्लिङ् or the Benedictive tense. Its conjugation is different from the conjugation of the ordinary लिङ् which we have called the Potential or Optative; as चिरं जीव्याद् भवान् or चिरं जीवतु भवान् 'may you live long'!\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting benediction'. Observe चिरं जीवति देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> lives long'.",
    "33174": "The affixes therefore, 'give the sense of the agent, with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent, the sense being simply appellative'. Thus तन्तिः = तनुतात् 'a weaver' (lit. may he weave); सातिः or सतिः = सनुतात् [[6.4.45]] 'wealth or gift'; भूतिः = भवतात् 'success'; मन्मिः = मनुतात् 'respect'. These are examples of words formed by the affix क्तिच् । Of words formed by क्त in this sense, we have देवदत्तः = देवा एनं देयासुः <i>Devadatta</i> (lit. may the Gods give him). Though the affix क्त has already once been generally ordained, its repetition here is to prevent its being superseded by क्तिच् । The च् of क्तिच् is qualifying only, distinguishing it from क्तिन् &c. and is useful in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.39]].",
    "33175": "This sets aside all other tense-affixes. As मा कार्षीत् 'let him not do' मा हार्षीत् 'Iet him not take'.\n\nHow have we then the Imperative and the Future tenses in the following sentence instead of the Aorist ? मा भवतु तस्य पापं मा भविष्यति । This sentence is against good usage. Or, we may explain it by saying that there is another मा which has not the indicatory ङ; and with that मा, other tenses may be used. The augment is elided after the prohibitive participle मा, by [[6.4.74]].",
    "33176": "By च we introduce लुङ् into the aphorism. Thus मास्म करोत् or कार्षीत् 'let him not make'; मास्म हरत् or हार्षीत् 'let him not take'.",
    "34001": "The above <i>sutra</i> is thus translated by Professor Bohtlingk:- \"Words formed with affixes stand, (in reference to the time) in closer relation to the verb (with which they are allied)\". Thus [[3.2.85]] has taught that words like अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् have a past significance, i.e. they denote a person who has already performed the ceremony of <i>Agnishtoma</i>. According to the present <i>sutra</i>, in spite of this past significance, inherent in the word, one may use this word with a future tense, whereby it is reduced to a future-denoting word. Thus अग्निष्टोमयाज्यस्य पुत्रो जनिता means 'to him a son will be born who will perform the said <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice'.\n\nThe above is not a literal translation but rather an adaptation. The literal translation will be something like this. \"Affixes are employed in denoting relation (सम्बन्ध) between the senses of verbs\". The word धातुसम्बन्ध is a Genitive Compound meaning 'relation of root'. The word धातु 'root' is figuratively used for धात्वर्थ 'sense of root'; so that the above compound means 'relation of the senses of roots'. In other words, the relation between the roots should be that of qualifier and the qualified. When there exists such a relation between the senses of two verbs, namely, that of qualifier and the thing qualified, then the affixes may be employed in denoting other times than that specifically ordained for them. In other words, to quote from the Guide to <i>Panini</i>: \"It is to be observed, that when primitive words are joined with verbs so as to qualify them, the time of the verbs being mainly the time that controls the sentence, any time denoted by the primitive affixes, by which the former words have been formed will be subordinate to and regulated by, but need not correspond to, the time of the verbs, so far as the form of those words is concerned.\"\n\nThus तत्र वसन् ददर्श 'living there, he saw'; अग्निष्टोमयाज्यस्य पुत्रो जनिता 'to him a son will be born, a performer of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice'; कृतः कटः श्वो भविता 'he will be to-morrow maker of the mat'; भाविकृत्यमासीत् ।\n\nHere, though the time of the action of living denoted by वसन् is present, [[3.2.124]], this action is present only in relation to the action of seeing, and though because the latter action is past, the former action also is past with reference to the speaker or writer, this circumstance does not affect the form of वसन्, which therefore may remain as it is. In other words, 'affixes are related directly to the root, and not to the whole sentence'.\n\nSimilarly the word अग्निष्टोमयाजी is formed by an affix [[3.2.85]] denoting past time, while the word जनिता is in the Future tense. Now, this linking together of a word in the Past tense with a word in the future is a valid usage. Here the time of the qualified verb भविता does not affect the special time of the qualifier <i>Agnishtomayaji</i>.\n\nQ.-- Why has the word प्रत्यय been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, when it was understood in this from [[3.1.1]] ? Ans.-- The repetition is for the sake of indicating that affixes which are not ordained to come after roots (धातु), but which are enjoined to come after nouns &c. such as <i>Taddhita</i> affixes, are even valid in other tenses than those in which they have been specifically enjoined when related to a verb. Thus गोमानासीत् 'he was possessed of a cow'; गोमान् भविता 'he will be possessed of a cow'. Here the <i>Taddhita</i> affix मतुप् is added to the noun गो 'cow', with a present signification [[5.2.94]], the word गोमत् meaning 'who has cows' or 'in which there are cows.' This word, गोमत्, however, is related and validly so, to the words आसीत् and भविता—one in the Past tense and the other in the Future.",
    "34002": "Professor Bohtlingk translates this as follows: \"When the repetition of an action is expressed, the Imperative is used, and though the second person singular is used, it may also stand for the second person plural.\"\n\nThe phrase धातुसम्बन्ध of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. The frequency or repetition of an action is called समभिहारः । This word qualifies the sense of the original. In other words, \"when the sense of frequency &c, is understood in connection with the action, this sense not being included in that of the verb, as it may be in the case of a verb from frequentative roots.\"\n\nThis Imperative mood is employed in all Tenses and Persons in connection with all moods. But this peculiar use of the Imperative is confined to the 2nd. person singular and plural <i>Parasmaipada</i> (हि and त); and 2nd. person singular and plural <i>Atmanepada</i> (स्व and ध्वम्). In other words, \"the Imperative second person (<i>Parasmaipada</i> and <i>Atmanepada</i>) is repeated, though the subject of the main verb be different and the verb be in any tense.\" Thus लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति 'he cuts repeatedly', as if some one was always calling out to him 'cut thou, cut thou'. लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव इमौ लुनीतः or इमे लुनन्ति 'they cut often and often'. So also लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव त्वं लुनासि, युवाम् लुनीथः or यूयं लुनीथ 'thou or you two or you all cut repeatedly' as if some one was calling out to you 'cut you, cut you'.\n\nSo also लुनीत लुनीतेत्येव यूयं लुनीथ, अहं लुनामि, अयमलावीत् &c. 'you cut, I cut, he has cut repeatedly', as if some one was calling out to us 'cut ye, cut ye'. Similarly with <i>Atmanepada</i> roots; as अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवायमधीते, इमौ अधीयाते, इमे अधीयते &c. 'he or they study hard' as if some one was calling out to them 'study thou, study thou'.\n\nSo also अधीष्वमधीष्वमित्येव यूयमधीध्वे &c. Similarly in every tense, mood and person; as, अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवाहमधीये, आवामधीवहे, वयमधीमहे ।\n\nThe Intensive verbs in यङ् also have this meaning of frequency, but there the verb is not repeated, as the sense of frequency there is inherent in the verb; in this case we must repeat the verb to express frequency. See [[8.1.4]].\n\nThis use of the Imperative is not found in Literature (Bohtlingk), but in <i>Marathi</i>.",
    "34003": "In this case also the terminations of the second person singular and plural <i>Atmanepada</i> and <i>Parasmaipada</i> are employed, namely, हि, स्व, or त and ध्वम् । Thus भ्राष्द्रमट मठमट खदूरमट स्थाल्यपिधानमटेत्येवायमटति or इमावटतः, or इमेऽटन्ति ।\n\nSimilar examples can be formed as in the last aphorism; only the Imperative is not doubled as in the last case.\n\nSimilarly छन्दोऽधीष्व, व्याकरणमधीष्व, निरुक्तमधीष्वेत्येवायमधीते, or इमावधीयाते or इमेऽधीयते 'he or they two or they all learn, learning Prosody, learning Grammar, learning <i>Nirukta</i>'.\n\nThis being an optional rule, we have these forms also; व्याकरणमधीते, छन्दोऽधीते, निरुक्तमधीते, इत्येवायमधीते, इमावधीयाते, इमेऽधीयते । छन्दोधीषे, व्याकरणमधीषे, निरुक्तमधीषे, इत्येव त्वमधीषे, युवामधीयाथे, यूयमधीध्वे । छन्दोधीये व्याकरणमधीये, निरुक्तमधीयइत्ये याहमधीये, आवामधीवहे, वयमधीमहे ।",
    "34004": "The examples have already been given under <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.2]]. We cannot say लूनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं छिनत्ति; we must use a verb from the root लू 'to cut'. Such as लुनाति, &c. So also अधीष्वाधीष्व takes अधोते only after it and not a synonymous verb like पठति &c.",
    "34005": "Thus ओदनं भुङ्क्ष्व, सक्तून्पिब, धानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति 'he takes his meals, eating rice, drinking <i>saktu</i>, and tasting fried corn'. Here the verb अभ्यवहरति has a sense common to all the verbs in the Imperative mood. The object of taking the second verb, having the senses common to all the antecedent verbs, is to prevent the repetition of all the previous ones. In the secular vernacular, the brevity, however, is often not approved.",
    "34006": "The words धातुसम्बन्ध and अन्यतरस्याम् are understood here also. By saying 'optionally', other tense-affixes may be similarly employed.\n\nThus देवो देवेभिरागमत् (<i>Rig</i>. I. I. 5.) 'O God <i>Agni</i>! come hither with the gods'. Here the Aorist आगमत् has the force of the Imperative. ये भूतस्य प्रचेतस इदं तेभ्योऽकरं नमः 'I make salutation &c. &c'. (<i>Rig</i>. X. 85. 17). Here अकरं is Aorist (लुङ्) and has the sense of the Present.\n\nSo also अग्निमद्य होतारमवृणीतायं यजमानः। Here लङ् is used instead of लट् ।\n\nSo also अद्या ममार = अद्य म्रियते । Here लिट् is used instead of लट् ।",
    "34007": "Thus in the sense of 'command' &c., he may be employed instead of लिङ्. This is called the Vedic Subjunctive and is peculiar to the Vedas only. Thus जोषिषत् (<i>Rig</i>. II. 35. 1) 'may he make us beautiful'. तारिषत् (<i>Rig</i>. I. 25. 12) 'may he increase'. पताति विद्युत् (<i>Rig</i>. VII. 25. 1) 'may the thunder-bolt fall'. भवाति (<i>Rig</i>. V. 37.5) 'may he become'. So also मन्दिषत्, नेता, नेषत्, तक्षिषत्, उदधिं च्यावयाति ।",
    "34008": "The word उपसम्वाद means 'reciprocal agreement, contracting to do'. Thus यदि मे भवानिदं कुर्य्याद् अहमपि भवत इदं दास्यामि 'If you do this for me, I will give this to you'. Agreements like these are called उपसम्वाद; while guessing or inferring the result from a cause is called आशङ्का 'apprehension or fear'.\n\nThus अहमेव पशूनामीशै ॥ मदग्रा एव वो ग्रहा गृह्यान्तै ॥ मद्देवत्यान्येव वः पात्राण्युच्यान्तै ॥ नेज्जिह्यायन्तो (or नेज्जिह्यायन्त्यो) नरकं पताम ॥ (<i>Nir</i>. I. II. Bohtlingk) = जिह्माचरणेन नरकपात आशङ्कयते ॥ All the above examples have the sense of Potential, but the Subjunctive (<i>Let</i>) must be employed necessarily in these senses and not optionally, which <i>anuvritti</i> was understood in the last <i>sutra</i>.",
    "34009": "In the Vedic literature the Infinitive is formed by the above 15 affixes. These, when stripped of their indicatory letters, will be found to consist of the following five affixes :-- (1) से = से, सेन् and क्से ॥ (2) असे = असे, असेन् and कसेन् ॥ (3) अध्यै = अध्यै, अध्यैन्, कध्यै, कध्यैन्, शध्यै and शध्यैन् ॥ (4) तवै ॥ (5) तवे = तवेङ् and तवेन् ।\n\nThe difference in the affixes is made by four indicatory letters, viz. न्, क्, श् and ङ् । The forces of क्, श् and ङ् have already been explained; the indicatory न् makes the word take the <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable [[6.1.197]]. Thus से is acute (III. I. 3); सेन् has acute on the first syllable of the word [[6.1.197]]; असे has accent of the affix (III. I. 3); असेन् throws the accent on the first syllable of the word; the indicatory श makes the numbers 11 and 12 <i>Sarvadhatuka</i>, and the root takes the proper <i>Vikarana</i> of its class before these affixes; while before तवै, the acute falls both on the first syllable and the last syllable simultaneously [[6.1.200]], [[6.2.51]].\n\nBefore going to give examples of these affixes, let us explain what is meant by तुमर्थ 'the sense of the affix तुम्' । The word तुमर्थ is here equivalent to भाव or 'action'; for the <i>pratyayas</i> or affixes, to which no meaning has been assigned in grammar, convey the meaning of the bases to which they are added. Thus no special meaning having been attached to तुमुन्, it will convey the meaning of the root to which it is added, i. e. it will denote the 'action' of the verb, or Infinitive mood. (1) से—वक्षे रायः । (2) सेन्—तवामेषे स्थानाम् (<i>Rig</i>. V. 66. 3). (3 and 4) असे and असेन्—अस्मे शतं शरदों जीवसे धा (<i>Rig</i>. III. 36. 10). So also कृत्वे दक्षाय जीवसे (<i>Rig</i>. X. 57. 4). With असेन् the word will be जीवसे । (5) क्से—प्रेषे भगाय । (6) कसेन्—गवामिव श्रियसे (<i>Rig</i>. V. 59. 3). It has not the नित् accent [[6.1.197]] which would have given us श्रियसे । (7 and 8) अध्यै, अध्यैन्—कर्मण्युपचारध्यै । (9) कध्यै—इन्द्राग्नी आहुवध्यै (<i>Rig</i>. VI. 60. 13). (10) कध्यैन्—श्रियध्यै । (11 and 12) शध्यै, शध्यैन्—पिबध्यै (<i>Rig</i>. IV. 27. 5); the accent however is on पि । सह मादयध्यै (<i>Rig</i>. VI. 60. 13). (13) तवै—सोममिन्द्राय पातवै । (14) तवेङ्—तं ते गर्भं हवामहे दशमे मासि सूतवे (<i>Rig</i>. X. 184. 3). (15) तवेन् = गन्तवे (<i>Rig</i>. I. 46. 7); कर्तवे (<i>Rig</i>. 1. 85. 9); हर्तवे ॥",
    "34010": "Thus (1) प्रयै देवेभ्यो महीः (<i>Rig</i>. I. 142. 6); प्र + या + कै = प्रयै = प्रयातुम् । (2) अपामोषधीनां रोहिष्यै । रुह् + इष्यै =  रोहिष्यै = रोहणाय । (3) अ + व्यथ् + इष्यै = अव्यथिष्यै = अव्यथनाय ।",
    "34011": "Thus दृशे विश्वाय सूर्यम् (<i>Rig</i>. I. 50. 1) द्रष्टुम् । विख्ये त्वा हरामि = विख्यातुम् ।",
    "34012": "Of the affix णमुल् the real affix is अम्; the letter ण् causes <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.115]]; and ल regulates the accent (VI. I. 193). So also of कमुल्, the letter क् prevents <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> substitution (I. I. 5).\n\nThus अग्निं वै देवा विभाजं नाशक्नुवन् 'the Gods were not able to divide <i>Agni</i>'. विभज् +णमुल् = विभाजं = विभक्तुम् । So also अपलुपं नाशक्नुवन्, instead of अपलोप्तुम् ।",
    "34013": "Thus ईश्वरोऽभिचरितो = अभिचरितुम् । ईश्वरो विलिखः = विलिखितुम् । ईश्वरो वितृदः = वितर्दितुम् ।",
    "34014": "The force of <i>kritya</i> affixes is to denote 'action' (भाव) and 'object' (कर्मन्). Thus अन्वेतवै = अन्वेतव्यम्; परिधातवै = परिधातव्यम्; नावगाहे = नावगाहितव्यम्; दिदृक्षेण्यः (<i>Rig</i>. I. 146. 5) = दिदृक्षितव्यम्; शुश्रूषेण्यः = शुश्रूषितव्यम्; कर्त्वम्; (<i>Rig</i>. I. I0. 2) = कर्तव्यम् ।\n \nThe affix तवै was mentioned in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.9]] also; there it has the force of the Infinitive, and here that of the Passive Participle. For its accent, see (VI. I. 200; 2. 51).",
    "34015": "Thus रिपुणा नावचक्षे (<i>Rig</i>. IV. 58. 5)=नावख्यातव्यम् । अव + चक्ष् + एश् = अवचक्षे । The <i>sutra</i> [[2.4.54]] is not applied here.",
    "34016": "These are also Infinitives. The phrase कृत्यार्था is not to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. The word भावलक्षण qualifies the sense of the root (भावो लक्ष्यते येन). Thus, स्था--आ संस्थातोर्वेद्यां सीदन्ति = आसमादेः सीदन्ति । इण्--पुरा सूर्यस्योदेतोराधेयः । कृञ्-- पुरा वत्सानामपाकर्तोः । वद्--पुरा प्रवदितोरग्नौ प्रहोतव्यम् । चर्--पुरा प्रचरितोराग्नीध्रीये होतव्याः । (<i>Gopatha</i> <i>Brahmana</i> II. 2. 10)। हु--आ होतोरप्रमत्तस्तिष्ठति । तम्--आ तमितोरासोत (<i>Taitt</i>. <i>Br</i>. I. 4. 4. 2) । जन्--आ विजनितोः सम्भवाम (<i>Taitt</i>. S. II. 5. I. 5).",
    "34017": "Thus विसृपः । पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपः (<i>Yaj</i>. I. 28.); आतृदः (<i>Rig</i>. VIII. I. 12); पुरा अत्रुभ्य आतृदः (<i>Rig</i>. VIII. I. 12). These words are Indeclinable by (I. I. 40).",
    "34018": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'in the Vedas &c' does not extend further. Thus अलं कृत्वा 'do not make'; खलु पीत्वा 'do not drink'; अलं काले रुदित्या 'do not weep, O girl !\n\nWhy do we say 'when there are अलं and खलु'? Witness माकार्षीः 'do not make'. Why do we say 'when expressing prohibition'? Observe अलङ्कारः 'decoration'.\n \nThe phrase 'in the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians' shows that it is an optional rule. Therefore we have अलंरोदनेन 'do not weep'. Or if rule [[3.1.94]] be applied, then the use of the word प्राचां is for the sake of merely showing respect (<i>pujartha</i>); the rule could have stood without it.",
    "34019": "Thus अपमित्य याचते 'having offered an exchange, he asks' अप + मे + क्त्वा = अप + मा + ल्यप् = अप + मि + तुक् + य [[6.1.45]] and [[6.1.71]] = अप + मित्य [[7.4.40]]. This is an optional rule, as the phrase 'according to the northern' indicates. So we have in the alternative, याचित्वाऽपयमते 'having asked he exchanges'; and this is the more general use of <i>ktva</i>; namely, it comes after that verb which is concerned about a time anterior to that of the other; see rule 21. The present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[3.4.21]].\n\nThe root मेङ् has been exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> as माङ्, with the vowel आ instead of ए. This indicates the existence of the following <i>Paribhasha</i>:--\n\n\"A root, which, when destitute of <i>anubandhas</i>, ends in either ए, ओ or ऐ, must not be considered to have ceased to end in either ए, ओ, or ऐ, when an <i>anubandha</i> has been attached to it.\" By this <i>Paribhasha</i> दैप् must be regarded as ending in ऐ, and as therefore आ may be substituted for the vowel ऐ [[6.1.45]], even while प् remains, दैप् does assume the form दाप् and is consequently; by the prohibition अदाप् in <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.20]], forbidden to be termed घु ।",
    "34020": "The situation on the पर 'the other side' and अवर 'this' side, is called परावरयोगः । Thus अप्राप्य नदीम् पर्वतः स्थितः 'the mountain is situate without having reached the river i. e. on this side of the river, the river being on the other side. Here the word पर्वत is qualified by the word नदी which is the point from which the situation is taken; and which in this case, is on the other side of the mountain. Similarly अतिक्रम्य तु पर्वतं नदी स्थिता 'the river is situate on the other side of the mountain'. Here the relation between the 'mountain' and the 'river' is of अवर and पर ।\n\nIn other words:- \"The gerund of a root may be used to imply the situation of a thing with reference to the situation of another spoken of as the agent of the action denoted by that root and of the action denoted by another verb or primitive word used along with the gerund; though the action referred to in the gerund is not prior to the other action\"--G. P.",
    "34021": "Thus भुक्त्वा व्रजति 'having eaten he goes'; पीत्वा व्रजति 'having drunk, he goes'.\n\nThe rule is not confined to the case of two verbs: thus, स्नात्वा, पीत्वा, भुक्त्वा, दत्वा व्रजति 'having bathed, drunk, eaten and given, he goes'.\n\nWhy do we say 'having the same agent'? When the agents are different, the gerund cannot be used, but the Locative Absolute construction will have to be used to express the same sense. Thus भुक्तवति ब्राह्मणो गच्छति देवदत्तः the '<i>Brahmana</i> having been fed, <i>Devadatta</i> goes'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which denotes prior action'? For, if the actions are co-eval, the gerundial construction will not be employed. Thus व्रजति च जल्पति च 'he goes and chatters'.\n\nVart:- The phrase आस्यं व्यादाय स्वपिति, सम्मील्य हसति 'he sleeps, with his mouth open, and laughs with his mouth closed', is valid, though the affix क्त्वा is not added to the verb denoting prior action.",
    "34022": "The phrases 'when the agent of both the verbs is the same' and 'after the verb whose action occurs first in time' are to be read into this <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. The force of च is to introduce the affix क्त्वा into this <i>sutra</i>. The affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> express 're-iteration' then only when the verb is doubled, and not singly. See rule (VIII. I. 4). Thus भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'having eaten repeatedly, he goes'; similarly भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति, पायं पायं व्रजति 'having drunk repeatedly he goes'.",
    "34023": "The word आकाङ्क्षा means 'inter-dependence' or the inability of a word, phrase or sentence, to indicate the intended sense in the absence of another word, phrase, or sentence. In other words, when there are two actions one prior and another subsequent, and they complete the sense of the sentence, without standing in need of any other verb; in such a case, <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> are not used, when the word <i>yad</i> is in composition. This <i>sutra</i> prohibits the affix <i>ktva</i> also, though the affix <i>namul</i> is in immediate context. Thus यदयं भुङ्क्ते ततः पचति, यदयमधीते ततः शेते, 'having eaten, he cooks ; having read, he sleeps'.\n\nBut when there is inter-dependence or आकाङ्क्षा, we have यदयं भुक्त्वा व्रजति, अधीत एव ततः परम् । Professor Bohtlingk translates it thus : \"In connection with यद् the above-mentioned Absolutives will not be applied, unless the two verbs required one more as complement.\"",
    "34024": "This is an <i>Aprapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. The word 're-iteration' is not understood here. Thus अग्रे, प्रथमं, पूर्वं वा भोजं भुक्त्वा व्रजति  'having first eaten he goes'.\n\nBy using the word 'optionally' it is indicated, that the regular Tenses, such as the Present &c, may be employed also. Thus अग्रे भुङ्क्ते ततः व्रजति 'he eats first and then goes'.\n\nQ-- The affixes of <i>Lat</i> (Present tense) &c. would have been applied by the rule of वाऽसरूप [[3.1.94]]; why then use the word 'optionally'?\nAns.-- The very use of the word 'optionally' in this <i>sutra</i> indicates the existence of this <i>Paribhasha</i> :- \"The rule (III. I. 94) has no concern with the affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i>, when both these affixes are enjoined at one and the same time by a single rule.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot apply [[3.1.94]] and use the affixes <i>Lat</i> &c, when 're-iteration' is meant That is the exclusive province of क्त्वा and णमुल् ।\n\nWhy is not here the <i>Upapada</i> compounding by rule [[2.2.20]]? For an answer to this, see the commentary on [[2.2.20]]. Had only णमुल् been enjoined by this <i>sutra</i>, and not क्त्वा also, then we could have formed the उपपद समास, for such is the force of the word एव in that <i>sutra</i>.",
    "34025": "Of the affix  खमुञ्, the efficient portion is अम्; the indicatory ख introduces the augment मुम् [[6.3.67]]. Thus चोरं कारमाक्रोशति 'he reviles him as thief, i. e. he calls out in abuse 'thou art a thief., thou art a robber, &c.' The person is not really made a thief, but making him a thief is to express one's indignation.",
    "34026": "The words within brackets are to be read into the <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[3.4.21]]. Thus स्वादुङ्कारं or लक्षणङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having made his food sweet or seasoned'.\n\nIn the <i>sutra</i>, the word स्वादुम् is used ending with म्. It is an anomalous form, and indicates that a म् must be added to the <i>upapadas</i> in these cases the object served by this form being that rule [[4.1.44]], by which feminine of words like स्वादु ending in उ is formed by long ई, does not apply here. Thus स्वाद्वीम् कृत्वा यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते । Here though यवागू is feminine, the attribute is still स्वादुं and not स्वाद्वीं ।\n\nIt might be said 'why not use the previous affix खमुञ्? That will solve all difficulties; and will give us the augment मुम् । To this, however, there is a fatal objection. The augment मुम् will, no doubt, come in the last example, but it will not come when the word to be formed is an Indeclinable [[6.3.67]], such as, when the sense is of the affix च्वि and all <i>chvi</i>-ending words are Indeclinables [[1.4.61]]. Therefore, the affix खमुञ् will not remove the difficulty in the following case; अस्वाद्वीं स्वाद्वों कृत्वा भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having first sweetened what was not sweet before'.\n\nBy applying rule [[3.1.94]], we have the affix क्त्वा in the alternative. Thus स्वादु कृत्वा भुङ्क्तं । All these affixes form abstract nouns (भाव) as they have the sense of the affix तुमुन् [[3.4.16]]. In connection with णमुल्, the Instrumental case can not, however, be used, i. e. we cannot use the Passive construction; e.g. स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूर्भुज्यते देवदत्तेन will be wrong.",
    "34027": "When is the non-employment of कृञ् valid ? When the same sentence will remain correct by omitting कृ, i. e. when without employing it, the same idea will be expressed. Thus अन्यथाकारं, एवङ्कारं, कथङ्कारं or इत्थङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats otherwise, he eats so, how does he eat, or he eats thus'. In fact, the sentence अन्यथाकारं भुङ्क्ते is equivalent to अन्यथा भुङ्क्ते ।\n\nWhy do we say 'if the non-employment would be valid'? Witness अन्यथा कृत्वा शिरो भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having turned his head aside'. Here कृञ् could not be spared.",
    "34028": "When one questions or replies in indignation, displeasure or anger, then is this construction valid. Thus तथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन 'l will eat in that way; what is that to you'? Similarly यथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when an angry reply is made'? Observe यथाकृत्वाऽहं भोक्ष्ये तथा त्वं द्रक्ष्यसि 'in what way I will eat, that thou wilt see'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the omission of कृञ् would be valid'? Witness यथाकृत्वाऽहं शिरो भोक्ष्ये किं तवानेन 'what is that to you, in what way turning my head I will eat'?",
    "34029": "Thus कन्यादर्शं वरयति 'he woos every girl that he sees i.e. all the girls seen'. ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति 'he feeds as many <i>Brahmanas</i> as he knows, i.e. all'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the total number of such objects'? Observe ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा भोजयति 'having seen the <i>Brahmana</i> he feeds him'.",
    "34030": "As यावद्वेदं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats all that he gets'. यावज्जीवमधीते 'he studies as long as he lives, i.e. throughout his life'.",
    "34031": "Thus उदरपूरं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats so as to fill his belly'? चर्मपूरं स्तृणाति 'he spreads so as to cover the skin'.",
    "34032": "Thus गोष्पदपूरं or गोष्पदप्रं वृष्टो देवः 'it rained filling up small puddles (lit. the impression made by the foot of the cow on the soil)'. सीतापूरं or सीताप्रं वृष्टो देवः 'it rained filling up all furrows'.\n\nWhy have we used the word अस्य 'of this <i>pur</i>' in the <i>sutra</i> ? The long ऊ of पूर् is to be elided, and not the long ऊ, if there be any, of the <i>upapada</i>. Thus मूषिकाबिलपूरं or मूषिकाबिलप्रं वृष्टो देवः । Here the long ऊ of मू is not shortened.",
    "34033": "The verb क्नोपि is the causative root formed from the simple root क्नूय् 'to wet'. Thus चेलक्नोपं वृष्टो देवः or वस्त्रक्नोपं or वसनक्नोपं &c. 'it rained so as to wet the clothes'.",
    "34034": "Thus निमूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes down to the roots'; समूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes up to the roots'. In fact, the gerund of the root and the root itself denote the same thing; the whole sentence निमूलकाषङ्कषति being equal to निमूलं कषति. From this <i>sutra</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.46]], the subsequent verb governing the previous word, must be derived from the same root from which the gerund is derived; see <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.46]].",
    "34035": "Thus शुष्कपेषं पिनष्टि = शुष्कं पिनष्टि 'he grinds it dry'; चूर्णपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds to powder'; रूक्षपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds it dry'. Here also an appropriate verb from the same root पिष् must be used to govern the gerund.",
    "34036": "Thus समूलघातं हन्ति [[8.3.32]] and [[8.3.54]] 'he destroys so as to tear up by the roots i.e. he totally extirpates'; अकृतकारं करोति 'he does a thing which was not done before'; तं जीवग्राहं गृह्णाति 'captures him so as to preserve his life, i. e. captures him alive'. Here also appropriate verbs from the same roots are used to govern the gerund.",
    "34037": "Thus पाणिघातं वेदिं हन्ति [[7.3.32]] and [[7.3.54]] = पाणिना वेदिं हन्ति 'the strikes the <i>Vedi</i> with the hand'; पादघातं भूमिं हन्ति 'he strikes the ground with the foot'. Reading this <i>sutra</i> along with [[3.4.48]], we find that हन् here does not mean 'to kill', and the further difference between this aphorism and that is, that in the case of this <i>sutra</i> a cognate verb from the same root must be used, as the gerund; not so in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.48]]; or this <i>sutra</i> may be for the sake of forming Invariable compounds with the <i>upapadas</i>, such as पादघातं ।\n\nAccording to <i>Patanjali</i>, this affix comes after हन् under this aphorism, even when हन् means 'to injure'; thus counteracting rule [[3.4.48]], by anticipation, and in opposition to the general principle of interpretation enunciated in rule [[1.4.2]]. Thus असिघातं हन्ति 'he kills with the sword'; शरघातं हन्ति 'he kills with arrows'.\n\nRule [[3.4.46]] applies here also, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34038": "Thus उदपेषं पिनष्टि = उदकेन पिनष्ठि (VI. 3. 58.) 'he grinds with water'; तैलपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds with oil'. Here also [[3.4.46]] applies, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34039": "Thus हस्तवर्ते, करवर्ते or पाणिवर्ते वर्तयति = हस्तेन वर्तयति 'he revolves by the hand'. So also, तम् हस्तग्राहम् गृह्णाति 'he takes him by the hand': so पाणिग्राहम्, करग्राहम् &c.\n\nHere also rule [[3.4.46]] applies and appropriate verbs from the same roots must be employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34040": "The word स्व means 'self', 'kinsmen' and 'property'. Thus स्वपोषं पुष्णाति 'he feeds himself'; आत्मपोषं, गोपोषं, पितृपोषं, मातृपोषं, धनपोषं, रैपोषं &c. See [[1.1.68]]. Rule 46 applies here also.",
    "34041": "Of course, rule [[3.4.46]] applies here also, and the gerund must be governed by a verb from the same root <i>bandh</i>. Thus चक्रबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds to the wheel'; कूटबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in a snare'; मुष्टिबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in the fist'. चोरकबन्धं बध्नाति = चोरके बध्नाति ।",
    "34042": "Thus क्रौञ्चबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in the manner called <i>krauncha</i>-<i>bandhan</i> or 'heron-knot'. मयूरिकाबन्धं बध्नाति or बद्धः 'he binds or is bound in a 'peacock-knot'. अट्टालिकाबन्धं बद्धः 'bound in a knot called <i>attalika</i>-<i>bandhan</i>'.\n\nAll the above, <i>krauncha</i>-<i>bandhan</i> &c. are names of various sorts of 'bonds or knots'. The rule (III. 4. 46.) also applies here.",
    "34043": "Thus जीवनाशं नश्यति = जीवो नश्यति 'perishes, so that his life perishes i.e. dies away'; पुरुषवाहं वहति 'the man carries, i.e. the man becoming a servant, carries another on him = पुरुषः प्रेष्यो भूत्वा वहन्ति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an agent'? Observe, जीवेन नष्टः 'destroyed by life'; पुरुषेणोढः 'carried by a man'.",
    "34044": "Thus ऊर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति वृक्षः = ऊर्ध्वे शुष्यति 'the tree is dried up while it is still standing'. Compare यद्वोर्ध्वशोषतृणवद्विशुष्कः 'or wither like the up-heaved grass drying up' (<i>Bhatti</i>. III. 14); ऊर्ध्वपूरं पूर्यते 'is filled full to the brim'. Rule [[3.4.46]] applies here also.",
    "34045": "The word 'agent' is read into the <i>sutra</i>, by virtue of the word च 'also'. That with which any thing is compared is called उपमान or 'object of comparison or similitude'. As घृतनिधायम् निहितम् जलम् 'water was kept as ghee would be kept'. सुवर्णनिधायम् निहितः 'was kept as gold'. The force is that of इव; thus घृतनिधायम् निहितः = घृतमिव निहितः । So also when the object of comparison is as agent: thus, अजनाशे नष्टः 'he perished like a goat'. So also चूडकनाशम् दन्तनाशम्, &c.",
    "34046": "From <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.34]] up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.45]], a verb from the same root must be employed in the subsequent part, as <i>anuprayoga</i>, from which the gerund in <i>namul</i> was formed. This rule has been illustrated in the examples under the previous aphorisms.\n\nThe present is a restrictive or <i>niyama</i> rule. This chapter deals with affixes employed in denoting syntactical relation between two verbs (धातुसम्बन्धे प्रत्ययाः)। See [[3.4.1]] : so a gerund in <i>namul</i>, would, of course, be followed by some verb as <i>anuprayoga</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> declares that the other verb must be from the same root as the gerund.",
    "34047": "The <i>Upapada</i> <i>samasa</i> is optional in this case [[2.2.21]]. Thus मूलकोपदं शम् भुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशम् भुङ्क्ते 'he eats after having relished the food with radish'. Similarly आर्द्रकोपदंशम् भुङ्क्ते or आर्द्रकेणोपदंशम् 'relished with ginger'.\n\nThe words मूलक &c in the above examples are the 'objects' of the verb उपदंश्, and 'instruments' of the verb भुज् ।\n\nBy the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. I. 94) the affix क्त्वा (or its substitute ल्यप्) may be optionally used, wherever we may use the affix णमुल् । Thus मूलकेनोपदश्य भुङ्क्ते ।",
    "34048": "Thus दण्डोपघातम् गाः कालयति 'he collects together cows, beating them with a club'. The compounding is optional [[2.2.21]]. Thus we have also दण्डेनोपघातम् । Similarly with other verbs having the sense of हिंस; thus, दण्डताडम् or दण्डेन ताडम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the object of the gerund is the same as the object of the main verb'? When the objects are different, णमुल् will not be employed. Thus चोरम् दण्डेनोपहत्य, गोपालको गाः कालयति 'having beaten the thief with the club, the cowherd collects together the cows'.",
    "34049": "The phrase '3rd case-affix' must be read into the <i>sutra</i> by virtue of the word च । Thus पार्श्वोपपीडं शेते 'he sleeps pressing on his sides'. The compounding is optional [[2.2.21]]; so we have in the alternative, पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् or पार्श्वाभ्यामुपपीडम् ।\n\nSo also व्रजोपरोधम् (or व्रजे उपरोधम् or व्रजेनोपरोधम्) गाः स्थापयति 'he stations the cows so that they are all in the fold'. पाण्युपकर्षं (or पाणावुपकर्षम् or पाणिनोपकर्षम्) धानाः सङ्गृह्णाति । It is <i>Bhvadi</i> कृष् here, and not <i>Tudadi</i>.",
    "34050": "The word समासत्तिः means 'immediate contiguity'. Thus केशग्राहम् (or केशेषु ग्राहम् or केशैर्ग्राहम्) युध्यन्ते 'having closely caught each other by the hair, they fight.' Similarly हस्तग्राहम् or हस्तेषु ग्राहम् or हस्तैर्ग्राहम्; so also यष्टिग्राहम् 'taking a stick'; लोष्ट्रग्राहं &c. See [[2.2.21]].",
    "34051": "The word प्रमाणं means 'length or extension'. Thus द्वयङ्गुलोत्कर्षं ( द्वयङ्गुले उत्कर्षम् or द्वयङ्गुलेनोत्कर्षम्) खण्डिकां छिनत्ति 'he cuts pieces of the length of two fingers'. See [[2.2.21]].",
    "34052": "The word परीप्सा means 'haste, hurry'. Thus शय्योत्थायं (or शय्याया उत्थायं) धावति 'having risen from bed, he runs away'. That is to say, he runs with such a haste that he does not perform even the necessary ablutions &c, but as soon as he rises from the bed, he runs off. Similarly रन्ध्रापकर्षम् पयः पिबति 'he drinks milk from a hole in the vessel', he being in such a haste, that he does not care to drink from the proper aperture. भ्राष्ट्रापकर्षमपूपान् भक्षयति 'he eats cakes hot from the frying pan', not waiting till they are placed on a dish.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning hurry'? Observe, आसनादुत्थाय गच्छति 'having risen from the seat, he goes'. Here 'haste' not being intended, the affix क्त्वा (ल्यप्) is employed. See [[2.2.21]].",
    "34053": "Thus यष्टिग्राहम् (or यष्टिं ग्राहम्) युध्यन्ते 'they fight, having hastily taken up sticks'. That is, they are in such a haste to fight, that they do not tarry to take up the proper weapons, offensive and defensive, but engage in fight with anything that is at hand, such as sticks, stones &c. Similarly लोष्ट्रग्राहम् or लोष्ट्रं ग्राहम् ।",
    "34054": "Thus ध्रुविक्षेपं कथयति 'he narrates, throwing his eye-brows (glances) about in all directions'. अक्षिनिकाणम् जल्पति 'he prattles, having closed the eyes'.\n\nThe स्वाङ्ग word is \"a word denoting a thing which not being liquid or gaseous, and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being, or though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually, (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.\"\n\nThe word अध्रुव means 'non-vital organ', or a limb which even being cut off, does not necessarily destroy life. Therefore, we cannot use the affix णमुल् in the following, as head is not an अध्रुव limb:- उत्क्षिप्य शिरः कथयति 'he narrates, having thrown the head on one side'. Compare [[6.2.177]].",
    "34055": "The word परिक्लिश्यमान means 'completely hurt or affected'. Thus उरः प्रतिपेषं or उरःपेषं युध्यन्ते = कृत्स्नमुरः पीडयन्तः 'they fight so as to afflict their whole bosom'. So also शिरःपेषं or शिरःप्रतिपेषं ।\n\nThe difference between this and the last <i>sutra</i> consists in this, that this <i>sutra</i> applies even to vital organs, such as 'breast', 'head' &c; while the last aphorism applies 'non-vital organs' only.",
    "34056": "The word व्याप्ति (or व्याप्यमान) means the full and complete pervasion of the substances with the actions (denoted by the verbs विश्, &c). The word आसेवा means 'assiduous performance of any action, or absorption into it'. In other words, 'frequency' of an action is आसेवा । The word व्याप्ति therefore refers to the noun (in the accusative case) and आसेवा to the verb (such as <i>vis</i> &c). These two words have the same significance here as the words नित्य and वीप्सा in <i>sutra</i> (VIII. 1. 4.) and by the application of that rule, both the noun and the verb require to be repeated. That rule, however, will not apply here, when there is compounding by [[2.2.21]]. But when there is no compounding, (for rule (II. 2. 21.) makes composition only optional) then there is repetition of the noun if व्याप्ति 'all' is meant; and of the verb, if आसेवा 'frequency or assiduous performance' is meant. Thus गेहानुप्रवेशमास्ते, (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रवेशमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रवेशमनुप्रवेशमास्ते) 'having entered the house, he sits down', meaning either, 'having entered every house in succession, he sits down', or 'having repeatedly entered the house, he sits down'.\n\nSimilarly with the root पत्, we may have three examples as in the last, and so also with the roots पद् and स्कन्द् । Thus गेहानुप्रपातमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपातमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रपातमनुप्रपातमास्ते); गेहानुप्रपादमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपादं or गेहमनुप्रपादमनुप्रपादम्); गेहावस्कन्दमास्ते (or गेहगेहमवस्कन्दं or गेहमवस्कन्दमवस्कन्दम्) ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the sense is that of all or frequency'? Observe, गेहमनुप्रविश्य भुङ्क्ते 'having entered the house, he eats'.\n\nQ.- By <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.22]], <i>namul</i> would have been valid, when <i>abhikshna</i> was meant; and <i>abhikshna</i> and <i>aseva</i> mean the same thing i. e, 'frequency'. Why then ordain <i>namul</i> again, by the present <i>sutra</i>, in the sense of <i>aseva</i> ? If you say, \"we repeat it, in order to prevent the coming of the affix क्त्वा\", that is not so. For क्त्वा would come by वाऽसरूप rule; (see [[3.1.94]] and [[3.4.47]]).\n\nA.- The repetition is for the sake of <i>Upapada</i>-<i>samasa</i> with a word in the accusative case. Under rule 22, there was no <i>upapada</i>, while in the present case there is an <i>upapada</i>.\n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates this <i>sutra</i> thus:- \"विश्, पत्, पद्, and स्कन्द् in composition with an accusative, form the absolutive gerund in अम् (<i>namul</i>), when one wishes to express that every object of that name is completely affected by the action, or that the action is constantly repeated in that object.\"",
    "34057": "The word क्रियान्तर means 'the interval between two actions'. Thus द्व्यहात्यासं or द्व्यहमत्यासम्म् गाः पाययति 'he gives drink to the cows, after an interval of two days, i. e every third day'. So also द्व्यहतर्षं or द्व्यहं तर्षं गाः पाययति 'having kept the cows thirsty for two days, he makes them drink'. That is to say, 'having given them a drink today, he gives them another drink after an interval of two days'; &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'after the verbs अस् and तृष्'? Because the affix णमुल् will not be applied after other roots, though the sense be that of interval of time. Thus द्व्यहमुपोष्य भुङ्क्ते 'having fasted for two days, he eats'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an intermission of action'? Observe अहरत्यस्येषून् गतः; here there is no intermission in the action of 'going'.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting time' ? Observe योजनमत्यस्य गाः पाययति 'allowing an interval of four miles to pass, he gives drink to the cows i. e. he waters the cows at every four miles'. Here the interval is that of 'space' and not of 'time', and hence the affix is ल्यप् and not णमुल् ।",
    "34058": "Thus नामादेशमाचष्ठे 'he mentions it, telling his name'. नामग्राहं मामाहूयति 'he calls me by taking my name (i.e. by my name)'.",
    "34059": "The word अयथाभिप्रेताख्यान means literally 'to denote the expression of that which is not really intended' i.e. a manner not suited to the proper communication of that news, such as communicating a bad news in a loud voice and good news in a low voice. The compounding being optional, the affix क्त्वा may be replaced by ल्यप्. Thus we have three forms नीचैःकृत्य, नीचैःकृत्वा, or नीचैःकार. Thus if one had communicated an agreeable news like the birth of a son in a low voice, the other may retort \"किं तर्हि वृषल नीचैःकृत्वा, नीचैःकृत्य, or नीचैःकारमाचक्षे\"; and so, if one had communicated an unpleasant news as ब्राह्मण कण्याते गर्भिणी in a loud voice, the other may reply \"किं तर्हि वृषलोच्चैःकृत्वा, उच्चैःकृत्य, or उच्चैःकारमाचक्षे । (See [[2.2.22]] for compounding).\n\nWhy do we say 'communicating in an undesired manner'? Observe उच्चैःकृत्वाऽऽचक्षे पुत्रस्ते जातः । Here only क्त्वा is added. Why have we repeated क्त्वा in this <i>sutra</i>, when in this chapter, by the rule of वाऽसरूप [[3.1.94]], <i>ktva</i> would have presented itself in the alternative? The repetition is for the sake of <i>samasa</i> or composition, by the application of [[2.2.22]]. The repetition of णमुल् is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, into which the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> runs concurrently.",
    "34060": "The word अपवर्ग means 'completing or finishing'. Thus तिर्यक् कृत्य, तिर्यक् कृत्वा or तिर्यक्कारं गतः - समाप्य गतः 'having completed, he went away'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning completion'? Observe तिर्यक् कृत्वा काष्ठं गतः 'having placed the wood obliquely, he went away'. Here णमुल् is not employed. See [[2.2.22]] for compounding. The word तिर्यचि is the locative of the word-form तिर्यच्, and not of the word तिर्यच् । Other examples are: एतदोश् [[5.3.5]]; अदसो मात् (I. I. 12).",
    "34061": "The word स्वाङ्ग has already been defined in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.54]]. The <i>svanga</i> word in the present case must be such as should end in the affix तस् - a <i>taddhita</i> affix technically called तसि and तसिल् [[5.3.78]] &c)). Though here there are two roots कृ and भू, and there are two affixes to be applied i. e. क्त्वा and णमुल्; yet the rule of 'respective allocation' [[1.3.10]] does not apply here. Both the affixes are applied to each of the roots. Thus मुखतः कृत्य गतः or मुखतः कृत्वा गतः or मुखतः कारङ्गतः । Similarly पृष्टतःभूय तिष्ठति or पृष्टतः भूत्वा तिष्ठति or पृष्टतः भावं तिष्ठति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'a word denoting a limb of one's own body'? Observe सर्वतः कृत्वा गतः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'ending in the affix तस्'? Observe मुखीकृत्य गतः, मुखीभूय गतः ।\n\nWhy do we use the word 'the affix'? If तस् is not an affix, but a verb, the rule will not apply. Thus मुखे तस्यति = मुखतः 'throws in the mouth'. With this मुखतः so formed, we cannot apply the rule. Thus मुखतः कृत्वा गतः ।",
    "34062": "Two words, नाना 'various' and विना 'without' are formed by the affix ना [[5.2.27]]; affixes having the force of धा are धा, ध्यम्, धम् and एधा [[5.3.42]] to [[5.3.46]] which are added to numerals in the sense of 'part' or 'fold' &c. The force of <i>chvi</i> has already been explained.\n\nThus अनाना नाना कृत्वा गतः = नाना कृत्य गतः Similarly नाना कृत्वा or नानाकारं गतः । So also विना कृत्य, विना कृत्वा or विना कारं गतः । So also नाना or विना भूय-भूत्वा or भावं गतः । With words formed by धा and cognate affixes, we have:- द्विधा or द्वैधं कृत्य—कृत्वा—कारं—भूय—भूत्वा or भावं गतः । But not so in हिरुक् कृत्वा, पृथक् कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we use the word 'affix (प्रत्यय)' in the <i>sutra</i>? Without it, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus: नाधार्थे च्व्यर्थे, and then any word, having the sense of ना, which has the force of 'except', 'various' or the sense of धा which means 'part or fold', when in composition with कृ or भू, would have taken the affix णमुल् and क्त्वा. But that is not so. Thus the words हिरुक् 'except' and पृथक् 'separately' have the sense of ना and धा respectively; as हिरुक्कृत्वा, or पृथक् कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the <i>upapada</i> has the force of the affix <i>chvi</i>'? Observe नाना कृत्वा काष्ठानि गतः ।\n\nThe word अर्थ in नाधार्थ qualifies only the term धा, and not ना, for there are no other affix having the sense of ना, which is a single affix taught in [[5.2.27]]; while, as shown above, there are other affixes having the force of धा । The composition optionally takes place by [[2.2.22]].",
    "34063": "Thus तूष्णीम्भूय, तूष्णीं भूत्वा, or तूष्णीम्भावम् 'having become silent'. The repetition of भू in this <i>sutra</i>, shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of कृ does not run into it and altogether ceases.",
    "34064": "The word आनुलोम्य means 'agreeable, friendly or favourably disposed, or doing according to the wish of another'. Thus अन्वग्भूय—अन्वग्भूत्वा or अन्वग् भावमास्ते 'he is favourably disposed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning friendly' ? Observe अन्वग्भूत्वा तिष्ठति 'he remains behind'.",
    "34065": "The use of the Infinitive in तुमुन् formed by this rule, differs from that given in <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.10]]. In that <i>sutra</i> the Infinitive had the force of 'purpose' and here there is no such force. Moreover in this case there is an <i>upapada</i> in construction, though that <i>upapada</i> is a verb; in rule [[3.3.10]], there was no such <i>upapada</i>.\n\nThus शक्नोमि भोक्तुम् 'I am able to eat'. Similarly जानाति—ग्लायति—घटते—आरभते—लभते—प्रक्रमते—सहते—अर्हति—अस्ति—भवति—or विद्यते भोक्तुम् 'he knows', he is wearied, he strives, he begins, he gets, he proceeds, he bears, he condescends or he is, to eat'.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> presents a knotty point. <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshita</i> says अर्थग्रहणमस्तिनैव सम्बध्यते अनन्तरत्वात् i.e. the <i>sutra</i> gives roots from शक् to अर्ह and roots having the same sense as अस् 'to be'. But this is hardly consistent with the almost overwhelming evidence of usage. According to <i>Dikshita</i>'s interpretation, पारय 'to be able' cannot be used with the Infinitive, but न पारयामि निवेदयितुम् (S. 4), पारयिष्यस्यत्रभवत्यअपरान्दधुम् (M. 3.) are instances from a standard author; similarly विद् 'to know' cannot be used with the Infinitive; but न च वेद सम्यग् द्रष्टुम् न सा (R. VI. 30) is as good an instance. We must, therefore, suppose that the <i>sutra</i> indicates the existence of an interpretation connecting अर्थ with all the preceding roots; otherwise we shall have to condemn as wrong, all such constructions as those given above. Taking this view I have interpreted the <i>sutra</i>, connecting अर्थ with all the above roots.- <i>Apte</i>'s Composition.",
    "34066": "The word पर्याप्ति means 'capability, ability, fulness'. Thus लिखितमपि ललाटे प्रोज्झितुम् कः समर्थः (<i>Hitopadesa</i>) 'who is able to avoid that which is stamped on his forehead'. लोकान् अलं दग्धुम् हि तत्तपः (<i>Kumara</i> II. 56) 'his penance is able to burn the worlds'. अस्ति मे विभवः सर्वं परिज्ञातुं (<i>Vikramorvasi</i> 2) 'I have power to know every thing'. भोक्तुम् प्रवीणः कुशलः पटुर्वा 'skilful in eating'.\n\nAnother interpretation of the <i>sutra</i> is \"the affix <i>tumun</i> is added to a verb, when it has in composition with it, the word पर्याप्ति or अलम् or a synonym of <i>alam</i> having the sense of <i>paryapti</i>. Thus पर्याप्तो भोक्तुम्, अलं भोक्तुम्, भोक्तुम् पारयति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'having the sense of capability'? Observe अलम्कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we say 'having the meaning of अलम्'? Observe पर्याप्तुम् भुङ्क्ते । The word शक् in the preceding <i>sutra</i> has not the sense of अलम् in that aphorism. With the sense of अलम्, the present <i>sutra</i> will apply: as शक्यमेवं कर्तुम् ।",
    "34067": "The words formed by <i>krit</i> affixes have the sense of agency; when no other special sense has been assigned to them by any rule, then this rule will apply, and fix the force of the affix. This rule will not, therefore, apply to <i>krit</i> affixes like ख्युन् [[3.2.5]] and [[3.2.6]] to which a special sense has been assigned, but affixes like ण्वुल् and तृच् &c, [[3.1.133]]. Thus कारकः means a 'doer'; कर्त्ता 'an agent'; नन्दनः 'one who causes happiness'; ग्राही 'who seizes'; पचः 'who cooks'.",
    "34068": "These words are formed by <i>kritya</i> affixes and therefore by rule [[3.4.70]], they would generally denote an action in the abstract, and the object, but not the agent. The present <i>sutra</i>, however, makes them denote optionally the agent also. In the alternative they denote the action-name and the object also. Thus भव्य may mean 'existed', 'existence', or 'one who exists'; गेय means 'a singer', 'a song', or 'singing'; प्रवचनीय means 'one who explains', 'what ought to be explained', or 'an explanation'; उपस्थानीय means 'who waits upon', 'what ought to be waited upon or served', or 'waiting upon or attendance'; जन्य = जायतेऽसौ or जन्यमनेन means 'one who gives birth i. e. a father', 'birth' or 'what is born'; आप्लाव्य = आप्लवतेऽसौ or आप्लाव्यमनेन means 'who immerses', one 'immersing', or 'what ought to be immersed'; आपात्य = आपतत्यसौ or आपात्यमनेन means 'what falls upon', 'falling upon', or 'what ought to fall upon'. Thus गेयो माणवकः साम्नां 'the boy is the singer of the <i>Sama</i>'; or गेयानि माणवकेन सामानि 'the boy ought to sing the <i>Sama</i>'; प्रवचनीयो गुरुः स्वाध्यायस्य 'the <i>guru</i> is the expounder of the lesson'; प्रवचनीयो गुरुणा स्वाध्यायः 'the lesson ought to be explained by the teacher'; उपस्थानीयोऽन्तेवासी गुरोः 'the pupil is the servant of the teacher'; उपस्थानीयः शिष्येण गुरुः 'the teacher ought to be served by the pupil'.",
    "34069": "The term ल् means the ten affixes known as लट्, लिट्, &c; ल् is the common element of them all; and these affixes, when stripped of all indicatory letters, leave behind only the letter ल् which is thus common name for them all. The लः in the <i>sutra</i>, is the nominative plural of ल् । By the word च in the <i>sutra</i>, we draw in the word कर्ता or 'agent' from the last <i>sutra</i> into this. The force of these tense-affixes, when placed after transitive verbs is to denote the object and the agent; and when placed after intransitive verbs, is to denote either 'action' (भाव) or it may denote the 'agent'.\n\nThe verb itself denotes the action; to be or to do, generally; or to be or to do, in a particular manner. In the active voice the affix marks the agent; in the passive voice of a transitive verb, it marks the object; but in the passive form of an intransitive verb, the action itself. Thus, गम्यते ग्रामो देवदत्तेन 'the village is gone to by <i>Devadatta</i>'; here ते of गम्यते denotes the object and is in passive construction. गच्छति ग्रामं देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> goes to the village'; here the affix ति of गच्छति denotes the agent, and the sentence is in active construction. The verb गम् being a transitive verb, can take both the active and passive constructions or, to use the Sanskrit technical phraseology, the tense affixes, after transitive verbs, denote the agent and the object. They can never denote भाव or action after transitive verbs, that is, transitive verbs cannot be used impersonally. Let us now give examples of Intransitive verbs; आस्यते देवदत्तेन 'it is seated by <i>Devadatta</i>'; the verb आस्यते here denotes merely भाव or 'action'. In other words, we may call this an impersonal construction. आस्ते देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> sits'; here the verb आस्ते denotes the agent or is in the active voice.\n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates the <i>sutra</i> thus:- \"A finite verb expresses the agent as well as the object; but the Intransitive verbs denote, in addition to that, the Impersonal idea of the action\". The word भाव means action considered in the abstract.",
    "34070": "The word तयोः 'of those two' refers to भाव 'an Impersonal act', and कर्म, 'object'. The word एव 'only' is used in the <i>sutra</i> to exclude the word 'agent' from it. Thus कर्तव्यः कटो भवता 'the mat must be made by you'; भोक्तव्यः ओदनो भवता 'the rice must be eaten by you'. Here the affix तव्य has the force of denoting the object; we may, therefore, call it the Potential Passive Participle affix. So also आशितव्यं भवता 'thou must eat'; शयितव्यं भवता 'thou must lie down'. Here the sense of the affix तव्य being that of the action itself, which being Impersonal, is in the singular number, as it is one only, and neither male nor female, there is, from the nature of the case, a singular affix, and the neuter gender is employed.\n\nSimilarly the affix क्त denotes both the object and the action; कृतः कटो भवता 'the mat is made by you'; भुक्त ओदनो भवता 'the rice is eaten by you'. Here त is used with the force of denoting the object and may be called the past passive participle.\n\nSimilarly त may be used in denoting the mere act; आसितं भवता 'you sat'; शयितं भवता 'you lay down'.\n\nSimilarly the affixes having the sense of खल् [[3.3.126]] denote both the object and the Impersonal act. In the following examples the affixes denote the object; ईषत्करः कटो भवता 'this mat is made, by little at a time, by you'; सुकरः 'what is made with ease'; दुष्करः 'what is made with difficulty'. In the following examples the affixes denote the act; ईषदाढ्यम्भवं भवता and स्वाढ्यम्भवं भवता ।\n\nAfter transitive verbs, the <i>kritya</i>, the <i>kta</i> and the <i>khalartha</i> affixes only denote the object, but never denote the भाव or 'an Impersonal action'.",
    "34071": "The word आदिकर्मणि means 'the beginning of an action' or when the action signified by the roots, is intended to be expressed merely as having been simply begun. The force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that even when the beginning of an action is intended to be expressed, the क्त may be used to denote the act and the object as well. Thus प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः here the agent is denoted. प्रकृतः कटो देवदत्तेन; here the object is denoted. प्रकृतम् देवदत्तेन; here mere action is denoted. Similarly प्रभुक्त ओदनं देवदत्तः (agent); प्रभुक्त ओदनो देवदत्तेन (object); प्रभुक्तं देवदत्तेन (act).",
    "34072": "The phrase 'the act and the object' has been added into the <i>sutra</i> by virtue of the word च. Thus गतो देवदत्तो ग्रामम्  '<i>Devadatta</i> is gone to the village' (agent); देवदत्तेन ग्रामः गतः 'the village was gone to by <i>Devadatta</i> (object); गतं देवदत्तेन '<i>Devadatta</i> went' (act). The past participle forms from Intransitive verbs, denote the agent and the act only; or in other words, they are used impersonally and in the Active voice, but never in the Passive voice or denoting the object. Thus ग्लानो भवान् 'you were wearied' (agent), ग्लानं भवता (object); आसितो भवान् 'you sat' (agent), आसितं भवता (object); उपश्लिष्टो गुरुम् भवान् 'you embraced the teacher' (agent), उपश्लिष्टो गुरुः भवता 'the <i>guru</i> was embraced by you' (object), उपश्लिष्टम् भवता 'you embraced' (act); उपशयितो गुरुम् भवान् 'you lay near the <i>guru</i>' (agent), उपशयितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपशयितं भवता (act); उपस्थितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), उपस्थितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपस्थितं भवता (act); उपासितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), उपासितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपासितं भवता (act); अनूषितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), अनूषितो गुरुः भवता (object), अनूषितं भवता (act); अनुजातो माणवको माणविकाम् (agent), अनुजाता माणवकेन माणविका (object), अनुजातं माणवकेन (act); आरूढो वृक्षं भवान् (agent), आरूढो वृक्षो भवता (object), आरूढं भवता (act); अनुजीर्णो वृषलीं देवदत्तः (agent), अनुजीर्णा वृषली देवदत्तेन (object), अनुजीर्णं देवदत्तेन (act). The verbs श्लिष् &c, become transitive with certain prepositions or <i>upasargas</i>, hence they have been mentioned here. Otherwise there was no necessity of mentioning them separately; as they, being intransitive verbs, when without prepositions, would be included in the word <i>akarmaka</i> of the <i>sutra</i>.",
    "34073": "The word दाश comes from the root दाशृ 'to give' by adding  affix अच् under rule [[3.1.134]]. This being a कृदन्त word would have otherwise denoted the agent by rule [[3.4.67]] of this chapter. The present <i>sutra</i> makes it denote the recipient or have the force of the dative case. Thus दाश means 'to whom something is given i. e. a servant'. Similarly <i>goghna</i> does not mean 'the killer of cow' but 'he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest'. It is this irregularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law &c, and not the regularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which means 'a killer of cow' or a '<i>Chandal</i>'. Thus दाशः = दाशन्ति तस्मै; गोघ्नः = तस्मै दातुं गां घ्नन्ति ॥",
    "34074": "These words are formed by <i>Unadi</i> affixes. Thus भी + मक् = भीम (<i>Un</i>. I. 145, 148); भी + षुक् + मक् =भीष्म (<i>Un</i>. I. 148) &c. By the next <i>sutra</i>, <i>Unadi</i> words do not denote ordinarily the recipient and the ablation.\n\nThe present <i>sutra</i> makes them do so in the case of भीमादि words. The following is a list of <i>Bhimadi</i>words :- भीमः, भीष्मः, भयानकः (<i>Un</i>. III. 82), वरुः, चरुः, (<i>Un</i>. I. 7), भूमिः (<i>Un</i>. IV. 45), रजः (<i>Un</i>.

    "34075": "The <i>Unadi</i> affixes being a subdivision of <i>krit</i> affixes, would have, by rule [[3.4.67]], denoted the agent. By the present <i>sutra</i> they are made to denote the object, the instrument and the location also. The word ताभ्यां has been used in the <i>sutra</i> in order to include the word <i>sampradana</i> also. For, had the <i>sutra</i> been अन्यत्रोणादयः, only the <i>Apadana</i> <i>karaka</i> would have been excluded, as being the nearest; but not so the <i>Sampradana</i> <i>karaka</i>. Thus कृषितोऽसौ = कृषिः (<i>Un</i>. IV. 120) 'agriculture i.e. what is ploughed' (object); तन्यत इति = तन्तुः (<i>Un</i>. 1. 69) 'a thread i.e. what is drawn out'; वृत्तमिति वर्त्म (<i>Un</i>. IV. 145) 'a way i.e. what is established'; चरितं = चर्म (<i>Un</i>. IV. 145) 'skin' (in which they live).",
    "34076": "The verbs denoting ध्रौव्य or 'persisting in a place' are Intransitive verbs. The word <i>pratyavasana</i> means 'eating' also; the force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is that the affix <i>kta</i> expresses other relations also. Thus after verbs denoting 'fixedness' or <i>dhrauvyartha</i> it denotes the agent, the act and the location; after verbs denoting 'motion' it gives the sense of agent, object, act and location; after verbs denoting 'taking or eating', it has the sense of object, act and location. Thus आसितो देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> sat'; आसितं तेन 'sitting by him' (act); इदमेषामासितम् 'this was their seat' (location); यातो देवदत्तो ग्रामम् '<i>Devadatta</i> went to the village' (active); यातो देवदत्तेन ग्रामः (passive); यातं देवदत्तेन (abstract); इदमेषां यातम् 'this is their place of going' (location); भुक्त ओदनो देवदत्तेन (passive); भुक्त ओदनं देवदत्तः (active); देवदत्तेन भुक्तम् (abstract); इदमेषां भुक्तम् (location); कथं भुक्ता ब्राह्मणाः । पीता गावः । The आ in भुक्ता and पीता has the force of मतुप् [[4.2.85]]. भुक्तमेषामस्ति or पीतमेषामस्ति ।",
    "34077": "This <i>sutra</i> consists of one word लस्य meaning 'of ल'. It is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. The word लस्य is the genitive singular of ल, the अ in ल being for the sake of pronunciation. The ल means the ten affixes: लट् present, लिट् perfect, लुट् first future, लृट् second future, लोट् imperative लेट् Vedic subjunctive, लङ् imperfect, लिङ् potential and benedictive, लुङ् aorist, लृङ् conditional. Six of these tenses have indicatory ट्, and four have indicatory ङ् । \n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates this <i>sutra</i> thus:- In the following <i>sutras</i>, the word लस्य should be supplied to complete the sense, i.e. the phrase 'in the place of all those endings which are known as the Personal endings of various tenses and moods, and are known in their totality as ल' ।",
    "34078": "These are the well-known Conjugational-affixes, called also Personal endings, and are ordained generally after all the ten tenses. But as a matter of fact, they undergo various additions and alterations in the different tenses. Some of these changes have already been mentioned before; see <i>sutra</i> (II 4. 85), [[3.1.33]], &c. Others will be mentioned hereafter. It is only in the present tense or लट् that the affixes as above given, may be applied to the root, in some cases, without any alteration.\n\nThe प in तिप्, सिप् and मिप् is for the sake of accent [[3.1.4]]; the ट् in इट् for distinguishing it in the <i>sutra</i> इटोऽत् [[3.4.106]]; and the ङ in महिङ् for forming the <i>Pratyahara</i> तिङ् which is the general name of the above 18 conjugational or personal affixes. Stripped off their indicatory letters, the following table shows the conjugational affixes as added under various tenses:-\n\nPRESENT TENSE.--लट् ।\n\n<i>Parasmaipada</i>.\n\n- 3rd person, ति, तस्, अन्ति\n- 2nd person, सि, थस्, थ\n- 1st person, मि, वस्, मस्\n\n<i>Atmanepada</i>.\n\n- 3rd person, ते, आते, अन्ते\n- 2nd person, से, आथे, ध्वे\n- 1st person, ए, वहे, महे\n\nIMPERFECT OR FIRST PRETERITE.—लङ् ।\n\n<i>Parasmaipada</i>.\n\n- 3rd person, त्, ताम्, अन्\n- 2nd person, स्, तम्, त\n- 1st person, अम्, व, म\n\n<i>Atmanepada</i>.\n\n- 3rd person, त, आताम्, अन्त\n- 2nd person, थास्, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, इ, वहि, महि  \n\nPOTENTIAL OR OPTATIVE.—विधिलिङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, यात्, याताम्, युस्\n- 2nd person, यास्, यातम्, यात\n- 1st person, याम्, याव, याम  \n\n- 3rd person, ईत, ईयाताम्, ईरन्\n- 2nd person, ईथास्, ईयाथाम्, ईध्वम्\n- 1st person, ईय, ईवहि, ईमहि  \n\nIMPERATIVE.--लोट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, तु, ताम, अन्तु\n- 2nd person, हि, तम्, त\n- 1st person, आनि, आव, आम  \n\n- 3rd person, ताम्, आताम्, अन्ताम्\n- 2nd person, स्व, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, ऐ, आवहै, आमहै  \n\nPERFECT OR SECOND PRETERITE.—लिट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, अ, अतुस्, उस्\n- 2nd person, थ, अथुस्, अ\n- 1st person, अ, व, म  \n\n- 3rd person, ए, आते, इरे\n- 2nd person, से, आथे, ध्वे\n- 1st person, ए, वहे, महे  \n\nFIRST FUTURE OR DEFINITE FUTURE.—लुट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, ता, तारौ, तारस्\n- 2nd person, तासि, तास्थस्, तास्थ\n- 1st person, तास्मि, तास्वस्, तास्मस्  \n\n- 3rd person, ता, तारौ, तारस्\n- 2nd person, तासे, तासाथे, ताध्वे\n- 1st person, ताहे, तास्वहे, तास्महे  \n\nSECOND FUTURE OR INDEFINITE FUTURE.—लृट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, स्यति, स्यतस्, स्यन्ति\n- 2nd person, स्यसि, स्यथस्, स्यथ\n- 1st person, स्यामि, स्यावस्, स्यामस्  \n\n- 3rd person, स्यते, स्येते, स्यन्ते\n- 2nd person, स्यसे, स्यथे, स्यध्वे\n- 1st person, स्ये, स्यावहे, स्यामहे  \n\nAORIST OR THIRD PRETERITE.—लुङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, सीत्, स्ताम्, सुस्\n- 2nd person, सीस्, स्तम्, स्त\n- 1st person, सम्, स्व, स्म\n\n- 3rd person, स्त, साताम्, सत\n- 2nd person, स्थास्, साथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, सि, स्वहि, स्महि  \n\nPRECATIVE OR BENEDICTIVE.—आशीर्लिङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, यात्, यास्ताम्, यासुस्\n- 2nd person, यास्, यास्तम्, यास्त\n- 1st person, यासम्, यास्व, यास्म  \n\n- 3rd person, सीष्ठ, सीयास्ताम्, सीरन्\n- 2nd person, सीष्ठास्, सीयास्थाम्, सीध्वम्\n- 1st person, सीय, सीवहि, सीमहि  \n\nCONDITIONAL.—लृङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, स्यत्, स्यताम्, स्यन्\n- 2nd person, स्यस्, स्यतम्, स्यत\n- 1st person, स्यम्, स्याव, स्याम  \n\n- 3rd person, स्यत, स्येताम्, स्यन्त\n- 2nd person, स्यथास्, स्येस्थाम्, स्यध्वम्\n- 1st person, स्ये, स्यावहि, स्यामहि",
    "34079": "The ल or the tense-affixes that have an indicatory ट् are six:- लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लोट्, लेट् । In these tenses the final portion called टि of the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes is changed into ए । Thus त becomes ते, आताम् becomes आते, झ becomes झे &c, as shown in the foregoing table.\n\nThe affixes शानच्, and कानच् are also <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. Why are not their finals changed into ए as in पचमानः, यजमानः? Because the word आत्मनेपदानां in the <i>sutra</i> refers by context to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes included in the <i>Pratyahara</i> तिङ् ।",
    "34080": "In the six tenses already mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i>, the <i>Atmanepada</i> थास् is replaced by से, as we have already shown in the preceding table. Thus पचसे, पेचिषे, पक्तासे, पक्ष्यसे ।",
    "34081": "The श् of एश् indicates that it replaces the whole of the affix त [[1.1.55]]. The च् of इरेच् is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 165). Thus पेचे, पेचाते पेचिरे । See the foregoing table of tenses for the <i>Atmanepada</i>.",
    "34082": "- 3rd person, <i>nal</i> (अ), <i>atus</i> (अतुः), <i>us</i> (उः)\n- 2nd person, <i>thal</i> (थ), <i>atus</i> (अथुः), <i>a</i> (अ),\n- 1st person, <i>nal</i> (अ), <i>va</i> (व), <i>ma</i> (म)\n\nThe indicatory ल् in णल् and थल् is for the sake of accent [[6.1.193]]. The indicatory ण् is for the sake of causing वृद्धि [[7.2.25]]. Thus पपाच, पेचतुः, पेचुः, पेचिथ or पपक्थ, पेचथुः, पेच, पपाच or पपच, पेचिव पेचिम ।",
    "34083": "Thus:--\n\n- 3rd person, वेद or वेत्ति, विदतुः or वित्तः, विदुः or विदन्ति,\n- 2nd person, वेत्थ or वेत्सि, विदथुः or वित्थः, विद or वित्थ,\n- 1st person, वेद or वेद्मि, विद्व or विद्वः, विद्म or विद्मः",
    "34084": "Thus आह 'he says'; आहतुः 'they two say'; आहुः 'they say'; आत्थ 'thou sayst'; आहथुः 'you two say'; the rest like ब्रू as shown below:--\n\n- 3rd person, आह or ब्रवीति, आहतुः or ब्रूतः, आहुः or ब्रुवन्ति\n- 2nd person, आत्थ or ब्रवीषि, आहथुः or ब्रूथः, ब्रूत्थ\n- 1st person, ब्रवीमि, ब्रूवः, ब्रूमः\n\nThe word आदितः 'first' is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that the substitution should not take place in the case of the last four affixes. The repetition of the word ब्रुवः in the <i>sutra</i> indicates the original expression which is to be replaced; and shows that this change occurs in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes only.",
    "34085": "This is an अतिदेश <i>sutra</i>; as in the लङ् there are the affixes ताम्, तम्, त, व and म, so also in the लोट् । Thus पचताम्, पचतम्, पचत, पचाव, पचाम ।\n\nQ -- If लोट् is like लङ्, why have we not the augment अट्, आट्, or the substitution of जुस् or झि (see [[3.4.111]]) in the case of लोट् also ?\n\nA. -- The वा of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.83]] is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also, so that the analogy between लोट् and लङ् is a limited analogy and does not make all the rules which are applicable to लङ्, equally applicable to लोट् also.",
    "34086": "Thus ति becomes तु, अन्ति becomes अन्तु, as have already been given in the above table.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of affixes हि and नि of लोट् । In the case of these two affixes, the इ is not changed into उ, either because they have been so taught in the <i>sutras</i>, or because the वा of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.83]] is understood here also and makes this rule an optional rule of limited scope as in the last <i>sutra</i> (व्यवस्थित विभाषा). Thus पचतु, पचन्तु ।\n\nIn fact, this <i>sutra</i> is confined to ति and झि only and does not apply to सि to which the next <i>sutra</i> applies.",
    "34087": "The substitute being like the original expression (1. 1. 56), हि substituted for सिप्, would have been a पित् affix, but for this <i>sutra</i>, which clearly states in its latter portion that this हि is not to be regarded as having an indicatory प ।\n\nThus लुनीहि, पुनीहि, राध्नुहि, तक्ष्णुहि; and as this affix is अपित्, rule (1. 2. 4) makes it ङित् also, and thereby no <i>guna</i> takes place.",
    "34088": "The result is that in the <i>Chhandas</i> the second person singular of लोट् has two forms as प्रीणाहि or प्रीणीहि; युयुधि or युयोधि, धि being substituted for हि in the Vedas, by rule [[6.4.103]] as in the following verse:\n\nअग्ने॒॒ नय॑ सु॒॒पथा॑रा॒॒येऽअ॒॒स्मान्विश्वा॑निदेव व॒॒यूना॑निविद्वा॒॒न् ।\nयु योध्य॒॒स्मज्जु॑हुरा॒॒णमेनो॒॒भूयि॑ष्ठान्ते॒॒ नमाऽउक्तिम्विधेम ॥\n\n                          --<i>Rig</i> 1. 189. 1: <i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i>. 40. 16.",
    "34089": "This supersedes the rule relating to the change of इ into उ, and the rule of <i>lopa</i>; see the table; thus पचानि, पठानि ।",
    "34090": "This relates to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affix ए. In the <i>Atmanepada</i>, आम् is substituted for ए in the Imperative; see the table; पचताम्, पचेताम्, पचन्ताम् ।",
    "34091": "This supersedes the आम् substitution of the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus, for से we have स्व, and for ध्वे we have ध्वम्; see the table; thus पचस्व, पचध्वम् ।",
    "34092": "This is clear. Thus in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, we have आनि, आव, आम । Thus करवाणि, करवाव, करवाम; करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।",
    "34093": "This relates to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affix. Thus करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।\n\nBut the ए resulting from <i>sandhi</i>, is not to be changed into ऐ । Thus पचाव + इदम् = पचावेदम्, पचाम + इदम् = पचामेदम् । Here, no doubt, the ए belongs to the Imperative by [[6.1.85]], being the substitute of अ of म and व. But this is not to be changed into ऐ on the maxim that this ए is the result of a बहिरङ्ग rule, for the rule of <i>sandhi</i> [[6.1.87]], is a बहिरङ्ग rule, while the present <i>sutra</i> is an अन्तरङ्ग rule; because of the following <i>Paribhasha</i>, असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे 'that which is <i>Bahiranga</i> is regarded as not having taken effect, when an <i>Antaranga</i> rule is to be applied.",
    "34094": "The augments अट् and आठ् are not to be added at once, but by turns. Thus जुष् + सिप् + अट् + त् = जोषिषत्; तारिषत्, मान्दिषत्; similarly पत् + आट् + ति = पताति; च्यावयाति । See [[3.1.34]] for the addition of सिप् in the above.",
    "34095": "Thus मन्त्रयैते, मन्त्रयैथे, करवैते, करवैथे । Why is not the augment आट् changed into ऐ ? Because otherwise the rule enjoining आट् would be superfluous.",
    "34096": "Thus शयै, ईशै, &c, in the following examples:- सप्ताहानि शयै, अहमेव पशूनामीशै, मदया एव वो ग्रहा गृह्यान्तै, मद्देवत्यान्येव वः पात्राण्युच्यान्तै । And in the alternative we have simply ए, as यत्र क्व च ते मनो दक्षम् दधसउत्तरम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'in other places than these governed by the last <i>sutra</i>'? Observe मन्त्रयैते, मन्त्रयैथे ।",
    "34097": "The वा of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. Thus जोषिषत् (<i>Rig</i>. II. 35. I). तारिषत् (<i>Rig</i>. I. 25. 12. मन्दिषत् । In the alternative, it is not elided as पताति विद्युत् (<i>Rig</i>. VII. 25. 1). उदधिं च्यावयाति । The इ of इट्, वहि and महि of the <i>Atmanepada</i> are not elided.",
    "34098": "As करवाव or करवावः, करवाम or करवामः । The first person is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that the स् is not elided in any other person.",
    "34099": "The tense-affixes having indicatory ङ् are four, namely, लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् । In their case, the elision of स् is not optional as was the case in the last <i>sutra</i>, but compulsory. See the table already given. In other words, in the Imperfect, Potential, Aorist and Conditional, the स् is elided in the Ist person. Thus अपचाव, अपचाम। The word नित्यं 'always' is used in order to stop the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'optionally'.",
    "34100": "Thus, for ति we have त्, for सि we have स्, &c, as in the above table. The इ of <i>Atmanepada</i> is, however, not elided, because the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>Parasmaipada is understood here from </i>sutra_ [[3.4.97]]. Thus अपचत्, अपाक्षीत्, but अपचावहि and अपचामहि।",
    "34101": "This we have shown in the above table. Thus अपचताम्, अपचतम्, अपचत, अपचम्, अपाक्ताम्, अपाक्तम् अपाक्त, अपाक्षम् ।",
    "34102": "The ट् of सीयुट् is indicatory and shows that this augment is to be placed before the affixes [[1.1.46]]. The उ is for the sake of pronunciation; this rule applies to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. In the Potential, the स् of this augment is elided by [[7.2.79]], and the य् also, before a personal-ending beginning with a consonant, is dropped according to [[6.1.66]]. In this way, we have पचेत, पचेयाताम्, and by [[3.4.105]], पचेरन् । In the Benedictive, the augment retains its full form, only so far as it is not governed by [[6.1.66]]. Thus पक्षीट, पक्षीयास्ताम् पक्षीरन् ।",
    "34103": "This debars सीयुट्; the उट् of यासुट् is indicatory; the real augment is यास्. All augments being <i>anudatta</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> therefore especially uses the word <i>udatta</i> to show that this augment is an exception to the general rule. Though लिङ् has an indicatory ङ्, and therefore by the rule (I. I. 56), its substitutes would also be regarded as having an indicatory ङ्, the repetition of the word ङित् in this <i>sutra</i> shows the existence of the <i>paribhasha</i> \"that the ङ् belonging to ल does not influence its substitutes;\" in other words, the substitutes of लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् are not to be regarded as having an indicatory ङ् (लकाराश्रयङित्वमादेशानां न भवति). In the Potential, the स् of यासुट् is elided by [[7.2.79]]. So we get the forms कुर्यात्, कुर्याताम्, and by applying [[3.4.108]] and [[6.1.96]], कुर्युस् । For the Benedictive लिङ् the following <i>sutra</i> applies.",
    "34104": "The कित् of this <i>sutra</i> refers to the personal affixes of the Benedictive mood and not to the augment यासुट्, for that would have been unnecessary, being already ङित् by the last rule. ङित् and कित् are equal in prohibiting <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i>, but ङित् is distinguished from कित् in as much as ङित् causes the <i>guna</i> of जागृ [[7.3.85]], and also there is distinction between them with regard to the change of semi-vowel to vowel [[6.1.15]] and [[6.1.16]]. Thus इष्यात्, इष्यास्ताम्, इष्यासुः, and जागर्यात्, जागर्यास्ताम् and जागर्यासुः । In the Potential, वच्यात् (no <i>samprasarana</i>); in the Benedictive, उच्यात् (vocalisation). So also जागृयात् in the Potential.",
    "34105": "The झ in other places, is replaced generally by अन्त [[7.1.3]], but in लिङ्, it is replaced by रन् । Thus पचेरन्, यजेरन्, कृषीरन् ।",
    "34106": "Thus पचेय, यजेय, कृषीय, हृषीय ।\n\nQ.-- In the <i>sutra</i>, the word अत् is used, and the final त् belongs to the विभक्ति, therefore by rule (1. 3. 4), this त् is not indicatory; why is it made so ?  \n\nA.-- This त is not any portion or member of the substitute; it is added to अ merely for the sake of euphony.\n\nThe इट् refers to the आत्मनेपद affix of the first person singular; and not to the augment इट् on the strength of the maxim अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य । A combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning.",
    "34107": "The letters त and थ are the objects to which the augment सुट् is to be added; provided that the त and थ are the initial of the affixes employed in लिङ् ।\n\nThe augment सीयुट् is applied to लिङ् as such; in other words, लिङ् is there the आगमी; but in the case of सुट्, लिङ् is not आगमी, but त and थ are the आगमी । The scope of सीयुट् and सुट् being thus different, one does not debar the other.\n\nIn the <i>sutra</i>, the word ति is used; the इ of ति is merely for the sake of pronunciation. Thus कृषीट, कृषीयास्ताम् कृषीरन्, कृषीष्ठाः, कृषीयास्थाम् । In the Potential, the स् is elided by [[7.2.79]].",
    "34108": "This debars अन्त (VII. I. 3); thus पचेयुः, यजेयुः ।",
    "34109": "This applies to tenses having ङ् other than that of लिङ्, namely, the लङ् and लुङ् ।\n\nसिच् is employed in forming the first Aorist. The reduplicated verbs, as well as the verb विद्, form their third person plural in जुस्, in the tenses other than लिङ्, and those that take सिच् । The word ङितः of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.99]], is understood here also; and therefore this rule is restricted to the Imperfect (लङ्) of the reduplicated verb. Thus of सिच्, we have अकार्षुः, अहार्षः । Similarly, after the Imperfect of the reduplicated verbs, we have अविभयुः, अजिहयुः, अजागरुः । In the case of विद्, we have अविदुः ।",
    "34110": "The सिच् is elided by rule [[2.4.77]]. Thus अदुः, अधुः, अस्थुः । In other words, in those cases, where सिच् is elided by rules [[2.4.77]], [[2.4.78]] and [[2.4.79]], only जुस् is the substitute of झि where the verbs end in long आ । In other words, this <i>sutra</i> restricts the scope of the last <i>sutra</i>, by which after every सिच्, जुस् was to replace झि ।\n\nThe Present <i>sutra</i> says that after verbs in which सिच् has been elided, जुस् does not replace झि in the case of any other verb than that which ends in long आ; it is thus a <i>niyama</i> rule.\n\nThus, by rule [[2.4.77]], सिच् is elided after the verb भू, but as भू does not end in long आ, its 3rd person plural Aorist will not be in जुस् । Thus, अनुभवन् । Here, by the last rule, and on the maxim that 'though सिच् is elided, yet its force remains [[1.1.62]]', जुस् would have replaced झि; but the present <i>sutra</i> prohibits that. But where the सिच् is not elided, there, of course, जुस् does come. Thus अकार्षुः, अहार्षुः ।",
    "34111": "Thus अयुः, अवुः । In the alternative, we have अयान् and अवान् ।  \n\nWhy is लङ् repeated here, when the context would have supplied this word; for the <i>sutra</i> applies to ङित् tenses, of which लुङ् being dealt with in the last, would have लङ् only to be dealt with by this aphorism, for no other ङित् tense (like लिङ् or लृङ्) can end in आ ? The repetition shows that the rule applies to those affixes which come after लङ् as लङ्, and not to those which come after another tense which is treated like लङ् । Thus लोट् is treated like लङ्, but for the purposes of this rule, लोट् would not be so treated. Thus the झि of लोट् will not be changed into जुस् by [[3.4.109]]. Thus बिभ्यतु, जाग्रतु, विदन्तु । The word एव has been used in the <i>sutra</i>, for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>.",
    "34112": "Thus अद्विषुः । But according to others, अद्विषन् ।",
    "34113": "Of course, this applies to the affixes which have been already treated before, namely, the affixes which relate to verbal roots and not to तद्धित affixes &c. Thus, स्वपिति, रोदिति, पचमानः, पयमानः । लिट् and आशीर्लिङ् are exceptions.",
    "34114": "Thus the affixes तृ, तुम्, तव्यम् &c. are आर्धधातुक affixes as in the following words- लविता, लवितुम्, लवितव्यम् । Here the augment इट् is added, because of these affixes being called <i>ardhadhatuka</i> by [[7.2.35]].\n\nThe word धातोः whose <i>anuvritti</i> began with <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.91]], is understood here also. So that the affixes in relation to the verbal roots get the name of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardhadhatuka</i>; the affixes applied to nouns do not get these names. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् when added to the noun लू, is not called an <i>arthadhatuka</i> affix, and therefore we have लूभ्याम्, लूभिः &c. Had these affixes been <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, they would have caused the <i>guna</i> of the base [[7.3.84]]. Similarly the affixes त्वं and ता in the words वृक्षत्वं and वृक्षता are not <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Had they been so, there would have been the insertion of the augment इट् [[7.2.35]].\n\nSimilarly in <i>sutra</i> (III. I. 5), the affix सन् is used without changing the sense, after the roots गुप्, तिज् and कित् । But as this affix is added without the enunciation of the word धातोः as it is in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.7]], this सन् is not called <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, and does not take the augment इट्, as जुगुप्सते ।",
    "34115": "This debars them from being called <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and, being <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, some of them take the augment इट्; as पेचिथ, शेकिथ । Moreover by their being <i>ardhadhatuka</i> they do not admit of the <i>Vikaranas</i> शप् &c.\n\nSo from ग्लै (ग्ला, VI. 1. 45) we have जग्ले; here the आ is elided by [[6.4.64]], the affix being treated as <i>ardhadhatuka</i>; similarly मम्ले from म्लै ।",
    "34116": "This debars these affixes from being called <i>sarvadhatuka</i>. Being <i>ardhadhatuka</i> they take the augment इट्, and before these affixes the root does not take the <i>Vikaranas</i> शप् &c. Thus from the root लू 'to cut', we have in the आशीर्लिङ्, लविसीष्ट; and from the root पू 'to purify', पविषीष्ट. But in the विधिलिङ् (Potential), we have the proper <i>Vikaranas</i> &c. as लुनीयात्, पुनीयात् ।",
    "34117": "In the Vedas, there is no hard and fast rule about <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and  <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Sometimes the तिङ् and शित् are treated as if they were <i>ardhadhatuka</i>. Thus वर्धन्तु त्वा सुष्टुतयः । Here the affixes of the लोट् are treated as <i>ardhadhatuka</i> and consequently there is the elision of the णिच् by rule [[6.4.51]]; the proper form of this word would be वर्धयन्तु । Sometimes ardhadhatuka<i> affixes are treated like </i>sarvadhatuka<i> affixes; as विशृण्विरे; here the affixes of the लिट् are treated as </i>sarvadhatuka<i> and so there is the </i>Vikarana<i>  श्नु and the उ is changed into व । Thus, वि + शृ + श्नु + इरे = वि + शृ + नु + इरे [[3.1.74]] = वि + शृ + न्व् + इरे [[6.4.87]] = विशृण्विरे । Similarly, सुन्विरे । The लिङ् is sometimes treated in the Vedas both as </i>sarvadhatuka<i> and </i>ardhadhatuka<i> at one and the same time; as  उपस्थेयाम् शरणं बृहन्तम् । Here, by treating the affix as </i>sarvadhatuka<i>, there is elision of स in the लिङ् [[7.2.79]] and by treating it again as </i>ardhadhatuka<i>, the आ of स्था is changed into ए । So also in स्वस्ति the affix is treated as </i>sarvadhatuka_ and there is no substitution of भू for अस् as required by [[2.4.52]].",
    "41001": "This is an '<i>adhikara</i>' aphorism pure and simple. It simply consists of terms which other aphorisms, in order to complete their sense, are under the necessity of borrowing. In other words, this <i>sutra</i> points out the base प्रकृति to which the affixes beginning with सु treated of in the next <i>sutra</i>, and ending with कप् [[5.4.151]], are to be applied.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> consists of three words. The term ङी is a common name for the three affixes ङीप्, ङीष्, and ङीन् ॥ The term आप्, is the common name for the three affixes टाप्, डाप् and चाप् ॥ These are feminine affixes and are taught from <i>sutra</i> 4 to 65 of this chapter. The word प्रातिपदिक means 'a Nominal stem' and has been defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.45]], [[1.2.46]], i. e. that which is possessed of a meaning, not being a root or an affix; or what ends with a <i>Krit</i> or a <i>Taddhita</i> affix. The word ङ्याप् प्रातिपदिकात् is a <i>Samahara</i>-<i>dvandva</i>  or Collective aggregate of these three words.\n\nQ. All affixes are placed after the base (See <i>Sutra</i> [[3.1.2]]); the affixes treated of in the last Book were to be placed after the root ('<i>dhatu</i>'); the remaining affixes taught in Books Fourth and Fifth, will therefore, be placed after all such bases प्रकृति which are not roots (<i>dhatu</i>); and such bases remaining are  <i>pratipadika</i> and feminine words. What is then the necessity of making this <i>sutra</i>, when these <i>pratipadika</i> &c, are the only bases left to us to apply the affixes taught herein-after ?\n\nA. To this we reply, the necessity of making this <i>sutra</i> arose from the following considerations: that the word ङ्याप् प्रतिपदिकात् should qualify the words 'वृद्ध' 'अवृद्ध,' 'the letter अ,' 'अनुदात्तादि', and 'द्व्यच्,' wherever used in the following <i>sutras</i>. So that, where a rule says: \"let such an affix be applied to a <i>Vriddha</i> word,\" we must understand it to mean, \"let such an affix be applied to a <i>Vriddha</i> word which is a <i>pratipadika</i>, or which ends with '<i>ni</i>' or '<i>ap</i>'; and not to every <i>Vriddha</i> word.\" The principal aphorism, besides the present, which regulates the application of <i>Taddhita</i> affixes, is [[4.1.82]], which declares:- \"The <i>taddhita</i> affixes, on the alternative of their being employed al all, come after the word that is signified by the first of the words in construction.\" Thus [[4.1.157]] says;-- \"The affix फिञ् is added, according to the opinion of Northern Grammarians, in the sense of 'descendant,' after a word which is entitled to the designation of <i>Vriddham</i>, provided it does not end with a <i>Gotra</i> affix.\" Thus the idea, 'the son of <i>Amragupta</i>,' may be expressed either by the phrase 'आम्रगुप्तस्यापत्यम्'; or by adding the affix '<i>phin</i>' to the first of the word in construction, viz, '<i>amraguptasya</i>,' which is a <i>Vriddha</i> word (1. 1. 73). But can we apply the affix '<i>phin</i>' to the first of the word in construction in the following, ज्ञानाम् ब्राह्मणानामपत्यम्'; because the word '<i>jnanam</i>' the genitive plural of '<i>jna</i>', is a <i>Vriddha</i> word ? Certainly not, because the word '<i>pratipadikat</i>' must be read into this <i>sutra</i> (IV. I. 157), and the affix '<i>phin</i>' should be added after that <i>Vriddha</i> word which is in its crude-form also a <i>Vriddham</i>, and not that which becomes <i>Vriddham</i> only in construction. Now the <i>pratipadika</i> of '<i>jnanam</i>' is '<i>jna</i>', the latter is not a <i>vriddham</i>, therefore, the rule does not apply to it. So also the word '<i>jna</i>' is a <i>vriddham</i> in its <i>pratipadika</i> state; but in the following phrase, it loses its <i>vriddha</i> nature; 'ज्ञयो र्ब्राह्मनोरपत्त्यम्' meaning 'the son of two wise <i>Brahman</i> ladies'. Still the affix '<i>phin</i>' must be added to the word '<i>jnyor</i>', because its <i>pratipadika</i> is a <i>vriddha</i> word (2) Similarly the word 'अवृद्ध' (<i>sutra</i> (IV. I. 160); 'the affix <i>phin</i> is applied diversely to a non-<i>vriddha</i> word, according to the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians') must be qualified by the word '<i>pratipadika</i>'; otherwise it would lead to similar incongruous results as in the last aphorism. (3) Similarly the word अत् in <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.95]] ('the affix इञ् is added after a word which ends in the letter अ') must be qualified by the word '<i>pratipadika</i>'; that is to say, the word in its crude-form must end in अ, and not necessarily when it is in construction. If it were not so; then the affix 'इञ्' will apply only to the word 'दक्षस्य' in 'दक्षस्यापत्त्यम्' but will not apply to the words 'दक्षयोः', or 'दक्षानाम्' in the phrases 'दक्षयोरपत्त्यम्' or 'दक्षानामपत्त्यम्' ॥ But the affix applies to all those three words.\n\n(4). Similarly the word 'अनुदात्तादेः' in [[4.2.44]], (the affix अञ् is added to a word which has the grave accent on its beginning), must be qualified by the word <i>pratipadika</i>. That is, the word in its crude form must have the grave accent on its initial, though in construction, it may or may not have grave accent. Otherwise, the affix 'इञ्' will apply to the words 'वाचः' and 'त्वचः' which in construction are <i>anudattadi</i> as in 'वाचो विकारः' [[6.1.168]]; but which in their crude-forms (वाक्, त्वच्) are <i>udattadi</i>. And conversely, the affix 'अञ्,' will not apply to the word 'सर्वेषाम्' which in construction is <i>udattadi</i>, as, 'सर्वेषाम् विकारः,' but which in its crude-form is <i>anudattadi</i>.\n\n(5). Similarly the word 'द्व्यचः' in [[4.4.7]], (the affix 'ठन्' is employed after words consisting of two vowels, when the sense is that of crossing), must be qualified by the word <i>pratipadika</i>. That is, the word in its <i>pratipadika</i> state must consist of two vowels, though in construction it may consist of more than two syllables. Otherwise, this affix will not apply to the word घटेन in the phrase 'घटेन तरति', while it will apply to the words 'वाचा' and 'त्वचा' in the phrases, 'वाचा तरति,' 'त्वचा तरति'. But this is undesirable.\n\nQ Why have we employed the word '<i>ny</i>-<i>ap</i>' in the aphorism? Is not the word <i>pratipadika</i> wide enough to include the words ending with the feminine affixes, by virtue of the <i>paribhasha</i>:-- \"A <i>pratipadika</i> denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, also such a crude-form as is derived from it by the addition of an affix denoting gender\" ?\n\nA. Not so. The <i>paribhasha</i> you quote applies to that case, where there is a rule, relating to an individual word-form, given in the <i>Sutra</i> itself. In other words, \"this <i>paribhasha</i> is applicable when a word is employed in grammar which either denotes <i>pratipadikas</i> generally (as the word '<i>pratipadika</i>' does in this <i>sutra</i>) or denotes a particular <i>pratipadika</i>, (such as the words युवा, खलति, पलित, वलिन, and जरति, in [[2.1.67]]).\" That is, in [[2.1.67]], the masculine form <i>yuva</i>, also includes the feminine : but not so every-where. Moreover the words, ङी, आप् have been employed in the <i>Sutra</i>, in order to make the <i>Taddhita</i> affixes applicable to feminine words ending in long ई (ङी) or long आ (आप्). Thus the feminine of 'काल', and 'हरिण' is, 'काली', and 'हरिणी', the feminine of 'खट्वा' and 'माला' is 'खट्वा' and 'माला' । After these words we can apply the <i>Taddhita</i> affix तरप् : as 'कालितरा', 'हरिणितरा', 'खट्वातरा', and 'मालातरा' ॥\n\nNow, had we not used the word '<i>ny</i>-<i>ap</i>' in the <i>Sutra</i>, and wished to express the same idea as is done, say, by the word '<i>kalitara</i>,' we could not have got this form at all.\n\nQ. The word काल takes ङीप् by (IV. I. 42); to which when तरप् is added, the vowel is shortened by [[6.3.43]]; and we shall get the form कालितरा ॥ Why do you then say that the <i>Taddhita</i> affixes could not be applied, but for the words <i>ny</i>-<i>ap</i>?\n\nA. To this we answer, that by the rule of <i>vipratishedha</i>, the <i>Taddhita</i> would have debarred the feminine. Thus, when feminine alone is meant and not comparison, we shall have काली; and when comparison alone is meant and not feminine, we shall have कालतर; but when both feminine and comparison are meant, then would arise the difficulty; and according to the general maxim, the <i>Taddhita</i> would have debarred the feminine. But by using the word <i>ny</i>-<i>ap</i>, it is shown that first the feminine affixes are to be added, and then the comparison making affixes.",

Thus, शुभंयाः कीलालपाः ब्राह्मणी 'the auspicious-going, nectar-drinking <i>Brahmani</i>'.

N. But the feminine of शूद्र is शूद्री when the meaning is 'the wife of a <i>sudra</i>'; so also when the word शूद्र is compounded with the word महत् as, महाशूद्री 'a woman of 'महाशूद्र' class'.\n\nThe term 'महाशूद्र' is applied to the caste of <i>Abhiras</i>: and this compound word would have taken the affix 'टाप्' by the rule of <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> given in [[1.1.72]], but for the <i>vartika</i>, viz 'शूद्रा चामहत पूर्वा जातिः' It might be objected that the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> cannot apply here on the strength of the following maxim:- \"That which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>pratipadika</i> does not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself\". Therefore, the word '<i>sudra</i>' which cannot be anything but a <i>pratipadika</i>, does not denote '<i>maha</i>-<i>sudra</i>'. This objection is futile: the very fact of this <i>vartika</i> indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>), that with regard to the application of the feminine affixes, the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> is valid and does apply.

A <i>pratipadika</i> pure and simple, not formed by an affix, may be उगित्, thus the pronoun भवतु among the <i>sarvanamas</i>: an affix may be उगित् as the affixes क्तवतु and शतृ, and therefore, the words formed by these affixes will be उगित्; similarly a letter may be उगित् as तृ meaning त् in [[6.4.127]], (\"तु is the substitute of the final of an inflective base ending in अर्वन् &c\")\n\nThus, भवत् 'honored' sir.—f. भवती 'madam'. Applying the rule of <i>tadantavidhi</i>, we have अतिभवत्-अतिभवती 'most exalted lady'. Similarly पचत् (formed by adding शतृ [[3.2.124]]), forms the feminine पचन्ती, the नुम् comes by (VII. I. 82). So also यजनी 'a female sacrificing'; अर्वत् अर्वती 'a mare'.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of verbal roots having an indicatory '<i>uk</i>'. Thus the roots स्रंसु 'to fall down', ध्वंसु 'to fall down' have indicatory उ; and we get from these roots, the <i>pratipadikas</i> like उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत्,[[3.2.76]]. The उखास्रत् ब्राह्मणी, पर्णध्वत् ब्राह्मणी ॥ Here, the feminine is not formed by adding ङीप् ।\n\nVart:- The <i>pratipadikas</i> ending with the verb '<i>anchu</i>', however, take the affix ङीप् । As, प्राची, प्रती़ही, उदीची ॥",
    "41007": "Thus धीवन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 115) f. धीवरी 'a female artisan'; पीवन् f. पीवरी 'a young woman, a stout woman', शर्वन् f. शर्वरी 'night' (शृ + वनिप् [[3.2.75]]) lit. that which destroys light. So also परलोकदृश्वरी ॥\n\nWords ending in वन् are formed by the affixes ङ्वनिप्, [[3.2.103]] क्वनिप् and वनिप् [[3.2.74]] These words end in न् and consequently would have taken ङीप् even by [[4.1.5]]; the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> arose in order to teach the change of न् into र् in case of words ending in वन् ॥\n\nVart:- If the affix वन् is ordained to be added to a word ending in हश्, (a letter of हश् <i>pratyahara</i>), and is thus immediately preceded by a soft consonant then this rule does not apply, that is to say, there is neither the application of the affix ङीप् nor the change of म् into र् ॥ Thus सहयुध्वन् is both masculine and feminine as, सहयुध्वा ब्राह्मणः or ब्राह्मणी 'a <i>Brahman</i> brother or sister in arms'. In शर्वन् the वन् is preceded by र् which is a letter of हश् class, but as वन् is not ordained to be applied to शर् but to शृ, and we get the र् indirectly by <i>guna</i>, the <i>vartika</i> does not apply to such a case.

Thus पामन् + डाप् = पाम् + आ = पामा, This being an optional rule we have I. s पामा d, पामे or पामानौ, pl, पामाः or पामानः; similarly with सीमा, as, सीमा, सीमे or सीमानौ, सीमाः or सीमानः ॥\n\nSo also in <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds ending in अम्. As:-\n\nबहुराजा, बहुराजे or बहुराजानौ, बहुराजाः or बहुराजानः ॥\nबहुतक्षा, बहुतक्षे or बहुतक्षाणौ, बहुतक्षाः or बहुतक्षाणः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"optionally\" ? So that the option may apply to <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.7]] also; i. e. when a <i>pratipadika</i> ending in वन्, which can be regarded as ending in अन्, is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, then the change of न् into र् and the application of ङीप् are optional we may apply the affix डाप् instead. As:-\nबहुधीवा or बहुधीवरी; बहुपीवा or बहुपीवरी ॥",
    "41014": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> aphorism pure and simple, and has governing force upto [[4.1.77]]: and prohibits the application of affixes to '<i>upasarjanas</i>'. That is to say, whatever we shall treat of hereafter, is to be understood to apply to such terms only, which are not <i>upasarjana</i> or a subordinate term in a compound. (1. 2. 43). Thus the next <i>sutra</i> declares \"the affix <i>nip</i> is added in forming the feminine after what ends in short अ, if the affix with which it ends has an indicatory ट्, &c.\" Thus the word कुरुचर is formed by the affix ट (111.) 2. 16), and ends in अ. The feminine of this word will be formed by ङीप् as कुरुचरी, similarly मद्रचर—f मद्रचरी । But if these words being the last members of a compound, are treated as <i>upasarjana</i> (1. 2. 43), then they will not take the affix ङीप् in the feminine. Now in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, all the component members are <i>upasarjana</i>, [[2.2.35]]; therefore, the feminine of such compounds will not take ङीप् ॥ Thus, बहुकुरुचरा or बहुमद्रचरा मधुरा ॥ Similarly [[4.1.63]] says, \"the affix ङीप् is added after words denoting <i>jati</i>\" as, कुक्कुठी, शुकरी ॥ But where these words are <i>upasarjana</i>, '<i>nish</i>' will not be added : as, बहुकुक्कुटा बहुशूकरा मधुरा ॥\n\nAs a general rule, <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> (I, 1, 72) does not apply to compounds; but the present <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication that the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies to compounds for the purposes of the application of feminine affixes. For had it not been so, there would have been no necessity of making the present <i>sutra</i> ; for a rule applicable to a simple word as such, would not have applied to it when it was part of a compound-- whether subordinate (<i>upasarjana</i>), or principal (<i>pradhana</i>). But the present <i>sutra</i> indicates that the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> does apply, if the word does not become a subordinate member, but is regarded as the principal member, of a compound.\n\nThe feminine of कुम्भकार or नगरकार will be कुम्भकारी or नगरकारी, in as much as the second member here is <i>pradhana</i> : the word '<i>kumbha</i>-<i>kara</i>' being formed by अण् (III, 2, 1), and thus making it possible to apply ङीप् by [[4.1.15]]. The affix अण् referred to in the next <i>sutra</i> refers to the <i>krit</i>-affix अण् [[3.2.1]], as well as to the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अण् ॥",
    "41015": "The word अतः 'ending in short अ' is understood here by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[4.1.4]]; and qualifies the affixes above-mentioned, wherever necessary. This debars the affix टाप् of [[4.1.4]]. We shall give example of each seriatim (1) Thus, m., कुरुचर f., कुरुचरी m., मद्रचर f, मद्रचरी (चर + ई = चर् + ई; the final अ  is elided by [[6.4.148]].) The word <i>kuru</i>-<i>chara</i> is formed by ट [[3.2.16]]. of which ट् is indicatory.\n\nQ. It might be objected, \"why is not the affix ङीप् added after the words पचमान, formed by the affix शानच् [[3.2.124]] in as much as this affix is a substitute of लट्; and because लट् has an indicatory ट्, therefore, its substitute will also be supposed to have an indicatory ट् [[1.1.57]].\"\n\nA. To this we reply, 'the affix लट् is not टित् as it has two indicatory letters, ल् and ट्'.\n\nQ. If that be so, affixes like ल्युट् should also be called no टित् affixes, as they have also two indicatory letters.\n\nA. To this we reply, that if ल्युट् be not regarded टित्, then the indicatory ट् of ल्युट् finds no scope any where: as the indicatory ट् of लट् has its scope in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.79]]. Therefore, the feminine of पचमान will be पचमाना ॥ Similarly, the indicatory ट् of augments will not cause the application of the affix ङीप्; thus पठिता विद्या ॥ Here the feminine of पठिता is formed by आ and not इ. This is indicated by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.23]], which says \"augment तुट् is added to the affixes ट्यु and ट्युल्\". If the ट् of तुट् could have made the affix टित् for the purposes of this present <i>sutra</i>; the <i>anubandha</i> ट् had been unnecessarily added to the affixes यु and युल् in the above.\n\n(2) Of words ending in ढ we have, m, सौपर्णेय f. सौपर्णेयी so also f. वैनतेयी. The ढ stands for the affix ढक्; and it is replaced by एय् [[7.1.2]] . Thus सुपर्णा + ढक् [[4.1.120]]= सुपर्णा + एय = सौपर्णेय [[7.2.118]]. There is no affix which is merely ढ without any indicatory letters; and denoting the feminine; the only affix, as said above, is ढक् ॥ Therefore, the following maxim does not apply here :- \"When a term void of <i>anubandhas</i> (indicatory letters) is imployed in grammar, it does not denote that which has an <i>anubandha</i> attached to it\", and we cannot say that the ड of this <i>sutra</i> refers to the <i>anubandha</i>-less ढ of [[5.3.102]] which is always Neuter.\n\n(3) Of words in अण्, we have already said that the affix अण् here refers to both the <i>Krit</i> and the <i>Taddhita</i> affix '<i>an</i>'. Thus with the <i>krit</i> affix '<i>an</i>' we have कुम्भकार and नगरकार [[3.2.1]], the feminine of which is कुम्भकारी and नगरकारी ॥ With the <i>Taddhita</i> affix '<i>an</i>' we have औपगव [[4.1.92]], the feminine of which is औपगवी ॥ Sometimes words formed by the addition of the affix ण are operated upon as if they were formed by अण् ॥ Thus चौरी, तापसी are the feminine of चौर and तापस [[4.4.62]], sometimes words formed by ण are not so treated, as दाण्डा, मौष्टा [[4.2.57]].\n\n(4) Words formed by अञ् as औत्स f. औत्सी, औदपान, f. औदपानी, [[4.1.86]]. Though by [[4.1.73]] the affix ङीन् would have come after the words ending in अञ्, the re-employment of this affix in the present <i>sutra</i> is for the purpose of preventing the application of the affix ङीष् which would have presented itself by [[4.1.63]]; that is even when '<i>jati</i>' is indicated, '<i>nish</i>' is not to be employed here.\n\n(5) The three affixes द्वयसच्, दघ्नच् and मात्रच् are added by [[5.2.37]]; as, ऊरुद्वयसी, ऊरुदघ्नी, ऊरुमात्री 'reaching to the thigh'. Similarly जानुद्वयसी, जानुदघ्नी, जानुमात्री ।\n\n(6) So also with words formed by तयप् [[5.2.42]]. As पञ्चतयी 'of which the parts are five' so also दशतयी ॥\n\n(7) So also with words ending in ठञ् [[4.4.1]] as, आक्षिकी 'a female dicer', शालाकिकी. The ठ is replaced by इक [[7.3.50]].\n\n(8) Similarly with words ending in ठञ् [[5.1.18]]: as, लावणिकी 'elegant'. The affixes ठक् and ठञ् are separately enumerated in this <i>sutra</i>, in order to exclude the affix ठन् &c. For had the word ठ merely been used, then it would have meant all the three affixes ठक्, ठन् and ठञ्, which is not desired.\n\n(9) Similarly with words ending in कञ् [[3.2.60]] as, यादृशी, तादृशी ॥\n\n(10) So also with words ending in क्वरप् [[3.2.163]] as इत्वरी 'swift', नश्वरी ॥\n\nVart:- In addition to the foregoing, there should have been the enumeration of the affixes नञ् and स्नञ् [[4.1.87]] and ईकक् [[4.4.59]] and ख्युन् [[3.2.56]] and of the words तरुण and तलुन 'a youth'. Thus स्त्रैणी 'a female', पौंस्नी 'a male', शाक्तीकी 'a female spear bearer', आढ्यंकरणी 'enriching'; तरुणी or तलुनी 'a young woman'.",
    "41016": "Thus गार्ग्य + ङीप् = गार्ग्य + ई [[6.4.148]] = गार्ग् + ई [[6.4.150]] = गार्गी 'a female descendant of <i>Garga</i>'; so also वात्सी ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies when the affix यञ् denotes a descendant, and not otherwise. Therefore ई will not be applied to form the feminine of द्वैप्य of द्वीप् + यञ् [[4.3.10]]. Its feminine will be द्वैप्या 'a living on or relating to an island'.\n\nThe separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, (for the affix यञ् could well have been included in the same), is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms; in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of यञ् only runs and not of others.",
    "41017": "Of this affix ष्फ the letter ष् is indicatory [[1.3.6]], and shows that the words formed by this affix will take '<i>nish</i>' [[4.1.41]]. The feminine nature is here manifested by these two affixes jointly, viz by '<i>shpha</i>' and '<i>nish</i>'. The object of saying that '<i>shpha</i>' is to be regarded as a <i>taddhita</i> affix, is that the word so formed may get the designation of <i>pratipadika</i> (1. 2. 46). The affix फ is replaced by the substitute आयन [[7.1.2]]. Thus गार्ग्य + ष्फ + ङीष् = गार्ग्यायणी; so also वात्स्यायनी ॥ This being an optional rule, we have in the alternative, गार्गी and वात्सी ॥\n\nThe word  सर्वत्र \"every where\", of the next <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this, by a process inverse to that of <i>anuvritti</i>, in order to prohibit the application of those rules even which would otherwise debar this. Thus [[4.1.75]] says:- 'the affix चाप् comes after आवट्य' ॥ Here आवट्य ends in यञ्, and by [[4.1.16]], the word आवट्य would have taken the affix nip: [[4.1.75]] debarred this. But according to Eastern Grammarians, here also the affix '<i>shpha</i>' will be added. Thus आवट्यायनी ॥",
    "41018": "The words लोहित &c. are a subdivision of <i>Gargadi</i> class ( IV. 1. 105). The present <i>sutra</i> makes the application of the affix ष्फ, compulsory while it was optional in the last. The word कत refers to the independent <i>pratipadika</i> कत in the said subdivision, which follows immediately after the word कपि, and not to the word कुरुकत of the same class, where the word कत is not an independent full nominal-stem but a member only. Thus, लोहित्यायनी, शांशित्यायनी,  बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i> कण्वात्तु शकलः पूर्वः कतादुत्तर इष्यते ॥\nपूर्वोत्तरौ तदन्तादी ष्फाणौ तत्र प्रयोजनम् ॥\n\nFor the purposes of the application of ष्फ and अण्, the word शकल which is enumerated in the <i>Ganapatha</i> after the word कण्व (See [[4.1.105]]) should be regarded as if it stood immediately before कण्व and after कत ॥ Thus we have शाकल्यायनी (with ष्फ), and शकलाः with अण्, meaning शाकल्यस्येमे छात्राः 'the pupils of <i>Sakalya</i>'.",
    "41019": "The word कौरव्य is formed by adding the affix ण्य to the base कुरु [[4.1.151]]; this word, ending in अ, would have formed its feminine by टाप् [[4.1.4]], but for the present <i>sutra</i>. So also by [[4.1.119]], the word माण्डूक is formed by अण् added to मण्डूक; and the feminine of <i>manduka</i> would have been formed by <i>nip</i> [[4.1.15]], but for the present aphorism, which supersedes that affix. Thus कौरव्यायणी, माण्डूकायनी ॥\n\nHow do you explain the form कौरवी in the phrase कौरवी सेना ?\n\nWe explain it by saying that कौरवी is not the feminine of कौरव्य; but of कौरव, formed by adding अण् to कुरु by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.120]].\n\nVart:- The word आसुरि should be enumerated along with <i>kauravya</i> and <i>mandukya</i>. Thus आसुरायणी ॥ The word आसुरि is formed by the affix इञ् added to the word असुर; the word '<i>asuri</i>' would, therefore have taken the affix अण्  in forming the further derivative [[4.2.112]]. But according to the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>, the word, '<i>asuri</i>' should form its further derivative (called also शैषिक) by taking the affix छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus आसुरीयः कल्पः (तेन प्रोक्तम्) ॥",
    "41020": "The word वयः means the condition of the body as dependent upon time; such as, youth, old age &c. Words expressive of early age form their feminine by ई, though ending in अ ॥ Thus, कुमारी 'a girl'. किशोरी 'a young girl' बर्करी 'a she-kid'.\n\nWhy do we say denoting 'early age?' Observe स्थविरा 'an old woman'; वृद्धा 'an old woman'. Why do we say ending in अ ? Observe शिशु, which is both masculine and feminine.\n\nVart:- The <i>sutra</i> should have been आचरमे वयसि 'words expressive of not old age'? Thus वधूटी 'a young woman', चिरण्टी 'a young woman'. These words denote the second stage of life, and not the first, i. e. they denote women who have attained their maturity.\n\nHow do you explain the form कन्या 'a girl'? This is an exception, and <i>Panini</i> himself uses the word '<i>kanya</i>' showing that it is a valid form; as in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.116]].\n\nThe words like उत्तानशया 'an infant girl that does not know how to lie down properly' लोहितपादिका 'a female infant whose feet are still tender and red' do not directly, but metaphorically, express age, and hence are not governed by this rule.",
    "41021": "Thus दशपूली, पञ्चपूली ॥ But we find त्रिफला 'the three myrobalans', because this is one of the words spoken of as 'अज &c' [[4.1.4]].",
    "41022": "This debars 'nip' which otherwise would have presented itself by virtue of the last <i>sutra</i>. The words बिस्तः 'a weight of gold equal to 80 <i>Raktikas</i>', आचितम् 'a measure of 10 cart-loads or 80,000 <i>tolahs</i>'; and कम्बल्यः 'a measure', all denote measure; and are the only words expressing measure to which this rule applies. The word परिमाण means 'measure', as distinguished from संख्या 'a Numeral', See [[5.1.19]], &c.\n\nThus पञ्चाश्व is a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, meaning 'purchased for five horses.' Here the <i>Taddhita</i> affix ठञ् [[5.1.37]] giving the sense of 'purchased with' has been elided by [[5.1.28]]. This compound does not end in a word denoting <i>parimana</i> techincally so called or a measure. The feminine of this word will not be formed by ङीप् but by टाप्, thus, पञ्चश्वा 'a female purchased for five horses'.\n\nThe words denoting 'time' or 'number' are not words denoting 'measure' as understood in this <i>sutra</i> by the word '<i>parimana</i>'. Thus, द्विवर्षा, 'a two years old female child', त्रिवर्षा 'a three years old female child' (V. 2. 37 <i>Vart</i>.) So also द्विशता 'a female purchased for two hundreds', similarly त्रिशता ॥ So also with the words बिस्त &c. As द्विबिस्ता 'purchased for two <i>bistas</i>', त्रिबिस्ता, द्व्याचिता, त्र्याचिता, द्विकम्बल्या, and त्रिकम्बल्या, &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'not ending in a word denoting a <i>Parimana</i> or a 'measure'? Observe द्व्याढकी, त्र्याढकी \"a female purchased for two or three <i>adhaka</i>\". Here <i>adhaka</i> means a measure equal to 7 Ib. II oz. avoir.\n\nWhy do we say 'when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided'? In '<i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i>' compounds, the affix '<i>nip</i>' will apply. Thus पञ्चाश्वी 'an aggregate of five horses', so also दशाश्वी ॥",
    "41023": "Thus द्विकाण्डा क्षेत्रभक्तिः 'a division of a field of the measure of two <i>kandas</i>.' Here, the word द्विकाण्ड is a <i>Dvigu</i> compound ending in '<i>kanda</i>'; the <i>Taddhita</i> affixes denoting measure enjoined by [[5.2.37]], have been elided by the <i>vartika</i> 'प्रमाणे लो द्विगोर्नित्यम्' given under the same <i>sutra</i>. The feminine, therefore, of this word will not be formed by '<i>nip</i>' but by टाप्; so also त्रिकाण्डा क्षेत्रभक्तिः ॥\n\nThe term '<i>kanda</i>' is a word expressive of non-measure; and, therefore, the prohibition contained in the last <i>sutra</i> applies to it; the present <i>sutra</i> is made to regulate this prohibition. That is to say, the prohibition contained in the last <i>sutra</i> is not universally applicable in the case of <i>Dvigu</i> compounds ending in '<i>kanda</i>'; it applies to cases where the compound refers to superficial land measure. Therefore we have, द्विकाण्डी रज्जुः 'a rope two <i>kandas</i> long'; त्रिकाण्डी रज्जुः 'a rope three <i>kandas</i> long'.",
    "41024": "Thus द्विपुरुषा or द्विपुरुषी परिखा 'a mote two <i>purusha</i> wide' so also त्रिपुरुषी or त्रिपुरुषा &c. The present <i>sutra</i> ordains an option where [[4.1.22]] would have made the prohibition universal. Why do we say 'when referring to measure'? Observe द्विपुरुषा 'a female purchased in exchange for two males'; No option is allowed here. Where the <i>Taddhita</i> affix is not elided, the present rule does not apply. Therefore in <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i> we have द्विपुरुषी or  त्रिपुरुषी ॥",
    "41025": "Thus the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound of कुण्ड 'a bowl' and ऊधस् will be कुण्डोधस्; then the final of <i>udhas</i> is replaced by the substitute अनङ् [[5.4.131]]; thus we have कुण्डोधन्; which would have been liable to the rules [[4.1.12]], (IV. 1. 13.) <i>ante</i> ; the present ¬<i>sutra</i> enjoins ङीष् instead. Thus कुण्डोध्नी [[6.4.134]] 'a woman with full bosom'; घटोध्नी 'a cow with udders like jars'.\n\nWhy do we say 'after a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound'? Observe प्राप्ता ऊधः = प्राप्तोधाः [[2.2.4]] which is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound.\n\nThe <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.28]] also is debarred in this case: for though the penultimate अ is elided by the [[6.4.134]], yet rule [[4.1.28]] does not apply here.\n\nThe substitution of अन् for the final of ऊधस् takes place only then, when the feminine nature is to be expressed and not otherwise. Therefore in the masculine we have महोधा पर्जन्यः 'the big-bosomed cloud'.",
    "41026": "This <i>sutra</i> ordains '<i>nip</i>', where by the last <i>sutra</i> there would have been '<i>nish</i>'. Thus द्वी + ऊधस् + अनङ् + ङीप् [[5.4.131]] = द्व्यूध्नी 'having two udders'; so also त्र्यूध्नी, 'having three udders'. The above are <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds beginning with a Numeral. Similarly अत्यूध्नी 'many-uddered.; निरूध्नी 'having no udders'.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with'? So that the rule may apply to compounds like द्विविधोध्नी and त्रिविधोध्नी, in which the words '<i>dvividha</i>' and '<i>trividha</i>', though not <i>Sankhya</i> are words which begin with a <i>Sankhya</i>.",
    "41027": "The word दामन् was liable to be operated upon by three rules, by, [[4.1.13]] ordaining डाप्, by [[4.1.11]] prohibiting totally the affixing of ङीप् and [[4.1.28]] ordaining <i>nip</i> optionally : the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>nip</i> to the exclusion of all those rules. As द्विदाम्नी 'a (mare) bound by two ropes'. त्रिदाम्नी ॥\n\nSimilarly हायन would have taken long आ by [[4.1.4]], this ordains long ई ॥ Thus द्विहायनी 'two years (old girl)', त्रिहायणी; चतुर्हायणी ॥  \n\nVart:- The word '<i>hayana</i>' must denote 'age', for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore we have no <i>nip</i> here:-  द्विहायना शाला 'a hall of two years existence'. So also त्रिहायना and चतुर्हायना ॥ Moreover in these latter cases the न is not changed into ण; for when हायन denotes 'age', it is then only that the न is changed into ण and not otherwise.",
    "41028": "Thus बहुराजन् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound ending in अन्; in applying <i>nip</i>, it loses is penultimate by [[6.4.134]] (अल्लोपोऽनः there is elision of अ of अन् when a <i>bha</i> affix follows). Thus बहुराज्ञी 'having many kings'. In the alternative, when <i>nip</i> is not added, we may add the affix डाप् by [[4.1.13]]. Thus बहुराजा, बहुराजे, बहुराजाः ॥ Or we may apply the prohibition contained in (IV. I. 12) and have बहुराजा, बहुराजानौ, बहुराजानः ॥ when the penultimate is not elided we cannot apply the affix ङीप् at all : in cases of such compounds there are only two forms of the feminine noun as सुपर्वा, सुपर्वे, सुपर्वाः or सुपर्वा सुपर्वाणौ, सुपर्वाणः ॥ That is to say we apply [[4.1.13]] and [[4.1.12]] only; for in the case of सुपर्वन् &c. rule [[6.4.137]] prevents the elision of the penultimate न्; (न संयोगाद्वमनन्तात्, there is not elision of the अ of अन् when it comes after a conjunct consonant ending in व or म)॥",
    "41029": "This is an exception to the last rule; for while that enjoined the optional, the present enjoins the compulsory application of the affix ङीप् ॥ Thus सुराज्ञी 'the city called <i>Surajni</i>'; अतिराज्ञी 'the city of <i>Atirajni</i>'. Similarly in the <i>Chhandas</i> we have गौः पञ्चदाम्नी, एकदाम्नी, द्विदाम्नी 'a cow having five udders, one udder, or three udders'. एकमूर्ध्रा समानमूर्ध्री ॥",
    "41030": "The phrase संज्ञा छन्दसोः of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. Thus केवली in the <i>Chhandas</i>, as opposed to केवला in the ordinary language, when not denoting a Name; so also मामकी and मामिका; भागधेयी as मित्रावरुणयोर्भागधेयी and भागधेया; पापी and पापा; अपरी as उताऽपरीभ्योमघवा विजिग्ये; (<i>Rigveda</i>. I. 1. 13) and अपरा; समानी प्रवाणी and समाना; आर्यकृती and आर्यकृता्; सुमङ्गली (<i>Rigveda</i> X. 85. 33) सुमङ्गला; भेषजी and भेषजा ॥ सुमङ्गल takes ङीष् also by [[4.1.41]], as belonging to <i>Gauradi</i> class No. 86.",
    "41031": "Thus या रात्री सृष्टा, रात्रीभिः (3rd pl); (<i>Rigveda</i> X. 127. I. I. 35. 1) but in the nominative plural we have रात्रयः, the regular plural of the word रात्रि, as in the sentence यास्ता रात्रयः, instead of रात्र्यः ॥\n\nVart:- According to <i>Katyayana</i>, <i>nip</i> is not added, not only when we apply the nominative plural termination जस्; but in all other terminations beginning with जस् also. Thus रात्रिं सहोषित्वा; here in the accusative singular case also the ङीप् is not employed.\n\nBut how do you explain the form रात्र्यः in the following तिमिरपटलैरवगुण्ठिताश्च रात्र्यः; This '<i>ratrya</i>' is the nominative plural of '<i>ratri</i>' which is formed by the feminine affix <i>nip</i>; and not by <i>nish</i>. The forms evolved by adding ङीष् or ङीप् are one and the same, except with regard to accent; that formed by <i>nish</i> has <i>udatta</i> accent on the final: the other has it on the initial. The word रात्रि is formed by the <i>krit</i> affix त्रिप् (<i>Un</i>. IV. 67), and therefore, it is a word which is governed by [[4.1.45]] because it is a word falling in <i>Bahuvadi</i> class, by virtue of the general subrule \"a word ending with the vowel इ of a <i>krit</i> affix, other than क्तिन् belongs to <i>Bahuvadi</i> class; some say that every word ending in इ, if it has not the force of the affix क्तिन् belongs to this class\". Therefore it takes ङीष् in forming the feminine.",
    "41032": "This <i>sutra</i> points out the base and teaches the addition of the augment नुक् ॥ When this augment is added, (and it must be added at the end, by <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.46]]), the forms become अन्तर्वत्न् and परिवत्न्; and these words must take <i>nip</i> by virtue of [[4.1.5]], if not by this <i>sutra</i>. Thus we have अन्तर्वत्नी and पतिवत्नी ॥ This irregular formation of the feminine is employed only then, when the sense of the words so formed is 'a pregnant female' and 'one whose husband is living' respectively. Therefore we have not the above forms in the following:- प्रथते त्वया पतिमती पृथिवी; here the word पतिमती qualifies the word पृथिवी and has not the sense of 'having the husband living', therefore its formation is regular. Similarly when the sense is not of 'a pregnant female', the feminine will not be अन्तर्वत्नी; in fact there will be no affixing of वत् (मतुप्). Because मतुप् is added to words possessing certain attribute, as described in [[5.2.94]], while the word अन्तर् has the sense of location, and can never be in apposition with the sense of अस्ति \"having\" as required by [[5.2.94]] The word अन्तर् would not therefore take मतुप् ॥ It does so irregularly by this <i>sutra</i>. The म is changed to व by [[8.2.9]] in अन्तर्वत् ॥ The change of म to व in पतिवत् is however irregular.\n\nThe augment नुक् is optionally added to these words in the Vedas:- as सान्तर्वत्नी or सान्तर्वती देवानुपैत् ॥ पतिवत्नी or पतिवती तरुणवत्सा ॥",
    "41033": "Thus पत्नि वाचं यच्छ ॥ The feminine पत्नी means legitimate wife, she who is entitled to take part in the sacrifices of her husband. The word यज्ञसंयोग is an Instrumental <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound and means \"related through sacrifice\" i. e who shares the fruits of and is entitled to participate in, the sacrifices of her husband. But when the sense is not that of 'wife', the feminine of पति will be पति as ग्रामस्य पतिरियं ब्राह्मणी 'this <i>Brahmani</i> is the head or mistress of this village'. If the word पत्नी means 'the wife who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband', it cannot be applied to the wife of a <i>Sudra</i>, for a <i>Sudra</i> cannot perform a sacrifice, a fortiori not his wife? The term पत्नी is, however, extended to the wife of a <i>Sudra</i> also, by analogy, as the marriage of a <i>Sudra</i> also takes place by offering sacrifice to Fire and making it a witness.",
    "41034": "The word सपूर्वस्य means when the word पति is not an <i>upasarjana</i>, but stands at the end of a compound. Thus वृद्धपतिः or वृद्धपत्नी; स्थूलपतिः or स्थूलपत्नी ॥ This is an example of <i>aprapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. Because it is free from the limitations of '<i>yajna</i>-<i>sanyoga</i>' of the last <i>sutra</i>. Why do we say when it is preceded by another word? Observe पतिरियं ब्राह्मणी ग्रामस्य, this <i>Brahman</i> lady is the mistress of the village.' Here the feminine is पति and not पत्नी ॥",
    "41035": "This enjoins the necessary and not optional substitution of न् for the final इ of पति, before the affix ङीप्, in the cases of certain words. The word '<i>nitya</i>' is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision. Thus सपत्नी, एकपत्नी ॥ The compound of the following words with पत्नी are governed by this rule:- 1 समान 'equal' 2 एक 'one', 3 वीर 'hero', 4 पिण्ड 'a cake', 5 भ्रातृ 'brother' 6 पुत्र 'a son', and 7 दास 'a slave' (this only in the <i>Chhandas</i>).",
    "41036": "Thus पूतक्रतायी 'the wife of <i>Putakratu</i>'. This and the two succeeding <i>sutras</i>, are in a way more intimately connected with [[4.1.48]], in as much as the sense of the feminine words must be that of 'wife of', otherwise these <i>sutras</i> will not apply. Thus if the meaning is not that of 'wife of', the word पूतक्रतुः will be both masculine and feminine as well, meaning 'she by whom sacrifices (क्रतवः) are sanctified (पूताः)'.",
    "41037": "The words वृषाकपि and कुसीद have <i>udatta</i> accent on the middle vowel (<i>Phit</i> <i>Su</i> II. 19), the feminine of these has <i>udatta</i>, however, on the final. The words '<i>agni</i>' and the rest have the <i>udatta</i> on the final (<i>Phit</i> <i>su</i> 1. 1), their substitute ऐ will necessarily be <i>udatta</i>, by the rule of <i>sthanivat</i> <i>bhava</i>, even if the present <i>sutra</i> had not explicitly declared it to be so. Thus वृषाकपायी (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> X. 86. 13) 'the wife of <i>Vrishakapi</i>', अग्नायी, (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. I. 22. 12) the wife of '<i>Agni</i>', कुसितायी 'wife of <i>Kusita</i>', कुसिदायी 'the wife of <i>Kusidai</i>'. The present rule only applies when the sense of the feminine word is that of 'wife of'. Otherwise we have वृषाकपिः स्त्री 'the women <i>Vrishakapi</i>' and not वृषाकपायी ॥ For the accent of the word वृष, See [[6.1.203]].",
    "41038": "The phrases ऐ and उदात्त are understood. The force of वा is to make the substitution optional. Thus we have three forms, मनायी or मनावी or मनुः, all meaning 'the wife of <i>Manu</i>'. The word मनु has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first vowel, as it is formed from मन् by the affix उ (<i>Un</i> l. 10), which by <i>Un</i> I. 9 is treated as having an indicatory म्, and affixes having indicatory न् throw the accent on the first syllable. (VI. I. 197)",
    "41039": "Thus of एत 'variegated'; the feminine is एता or एनी 'variegated', so श्येता or श्येनी 'black', हरिता or हरिणी 'green'. All these words have <i>udatta</i> accent on the first vowel either by Rule [[6.1.197]] (ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् \"word formed by affixes having an indicatory ञ् or न् have <i>udatta</i> accent on the first vowel\":) because these words are formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affixes तन् (<i>Un</i> III. 86) and इतन् (III. 93), or by the <i>Phit</i> <i>sutra</i> 11. 10 (वर्णानां तणतिनितान्तानाम् \"of words expressive of colour and ending in तण, or ति or नि or त, the <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the first vowel\").\n\nWhy do we say \"expressive of color\"? Observe प्रहृता, प्ररुता ॥ These words are also acutely accented on the first syllable, by rule [[6.2.49]] (गतिरनन्तरः \"the first word retains its natural accent in a compound of a <i>gati</i> word with a word formed by the affix <i>kta</i>\"). But as these words do not express color, their feminine does not take <i>nip</i>.\n\nWhy do we say \"ending in a gravely accented vowel?\" Observe श्वेता 'white'. Here though the word expresses 'color', yet it has acute (instead of grave) accent on the final (by rule of <i>Phit</i> <i>sutra</i> I. 21 घृतादीनां च \"the words <i>ghrita</i> &c. have <i>udatta</i> on the final\").\n\nWhy do we say \"having the letter त as its penultimate letter\"?  Otherwise the affix <i>nish</i> will be employed in forming the feminine.\n\nThe words for the application of this rule must end in the letter अ in the masculine. Otherwise this rule will not apply. As शितिर्ब्राह्मणी 'a black <i>Brahmani</i> woman'. Here शिति is a word expressive of color, it has a penultimate त, has <i>anudatta</i> accent on the final [[6.1.197]] as it is formed by the affix क्तिन्; but as it does not end with अ, its feminine is not formed with <i>nip</i>.\n\nVart:- The affix <i>hip</i> comes also after the word पिशङ्ग; as, पिशङ्गी 'of tawny color'.\n\nVart:- There is prohibition in the case of the words असित and पलित; as असिता 'black' and पलिता 'grey'.\n\nVart:- According to some, the substitute क्नम् replaces the final of these two words असित and पलिता in the Vedic literature. As आसिक्नी (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> IX. 73. 29); पलिक्नी (<i>R</i>. <i>Veda</i> V. 2. 4). According to some authorities, these latter forms are valid in literature other than the Vedic:- As गतो गणस्तूर्णमसिक्निकानाम् ॥",
    "41040": "The word वा of [[4.1.38]] does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. The word अन्यतः means in other cases than those governed by the last aphorism i.e. after words which have not त as penultimate. The difference between <i>nip</i> and <i>nish</i> affixes consists in accent, the former being gravely accented (111. 1. 4) and the latter acute. Thus सारङ्गी, कल्माषी, शबली ॥\n\nWhen the word does not express color, this rule does not apply. As खट्वा 'a bed-sted'.\n\nWhen the word does not end with a gravely accented vowel, this will not apply, as, कृष्णा , कपिला ॥",
    "41041": "Thus by <i>Sutra</i> [[3.1.145]] (शिल्पिनि ष्वुन्) the affix ष्वुन् is added to a root, to form noun of agency, denoting an artist. The feminine of the words so formed, will take <i>nish</i>. As, नर्तकी 'an actress', खनकी 'a digger'; रजकी 'a dyer'. So also the words गौर & c; as गौरी, मत्सी । The following is the list of words belonging to <i>Gauradi</i> class. \n\n1 गौर, 2 मत्स्य, 3 मनुष्य, 4 शृङ्ग, 5 पिङ्गल 6 हय, 7 गवय, 8 मुकय, 9 ॠष्य, 10 पुट, 11 तूण 12 द्रुण, 13 द्रोण; 14 हरिण, 15 कोकण, (काकण,) 16 पटर, 17 उकण, (आमल) 18 आमलक, 19 कुवल, 20 बिम्ब, 21 बदर, 22 फर्करक (कर्कर) 23 तर्कार, 24 शर्कार, 25 पुष्कर 26 शिखण्ड, 27 सलद 28 शष्कण्ड 29 सनन्द 30 सुषम, 31 सुषव 32 अलिन्द 33 गडुज, 34 पाण्डश 35 आढक, 36 आनन्द, 37 आश्वत्थ 38 सृपाट, 39 आखक (आपच्चिक), 40 शष्कुल, 41 सूर्य (सूर्म) 42 शूर्प, 43 सूच, 44 यूष (पूष) 45 यूथ, 46 सूप, 47 मेथ, 48 वल्लक, 49 घातक, 50 सल्लक, 51 मालक, 52 मालत, 53 साल्वक; 54 वेतस, 55 वृक्ष (वृस) 56 अतस, 57 उभय 58 भृङ्ग, 59 मह, 60 मठ, 61 छेद, 62 पेश, 63 मेद, 64 श्वन्, 65 तक्षन्, 66 अनडुही, 67 अनड्वाही, 68 । एषणः करणे । 69 देह, 70 देहल, 71 काकादन 72 गवादन, 73 तेजन, 74 रजन, 75 लवण, 76 औदाहमानि (औद्गाहमानि) 77 गौतम (गोतम) 78 पारक, 79 अयस्थूण (अथःस्थूण) 80 भौरिकि, 81 भौलिकि, 82 भौलिङ्गि 83 यान 84 मेध, 85 आलम्बि, 86 आलजि, 87 आलब्धि, 88 आलक्षि, 89 केवाल, 90 आपक. 91 आरट, 92 नट, 93 टोट, 94 नोट, 95 मूलाट, 96 शातन, 97 पोतन, 98 पातन, 99 पाठन (पानट) 100 आस्तरण, 101 अधिकरण, 102 अधिकार 103 अग्रहायणी (आग्रहायणी) 104 प्रत्यवरोहिणी 105 सेचन, 106 सुमङ्गलात्संज्ञायाम् । 107 अण्डर 108 सुन्दर, 109 मण्डल, 110 मन्थर, 111 मंगल 112 पट, 113 पिण्ड, 114 षण्ड, 115 ऊर्ध, 116 गुर्द, 117 शम, 118 सूद, 119 औड (आर्द) 120 हद (ह्द) 121 पाण्ड, 122 भाण्डल (भाण्ड) 123 लोहाण्ड, 124 कदर, 125 कन्दर, 126 करल, 127 तरुण, 128 तलुन, 129 कल्माष, 130 बृहत्, 131 महत्, 132 सोम, 133 सौधर्म । 134 रोहिणी नक्षत्रे । 135 रेवती नक्षत्रे । 136 विकल, 137 निष्कल 138 पुष्कल । 139 कटाच्छ्रोणिवचने । पिप्पल्यादयश्च । 140 पिप्पली, 141 हरितकी (हरीतकी) 142 कोशातकी, 143 शमी, 144 वरी, 145 शरी, 146 पृथिवी, 147 क्रोष्टु, 148 मातामह, 149 पितामह, 150 सुगेढ, 151 सुब, 152 सूर्य, 153 सकलूक, 154 आलिंगि, 155 पावन, 156 एत, 157 विटक, 158 भट्ट, 159 दहन, 160 कन्द, 181 कण ॥\n\nN.B.- The word गौर though denoting color, is finally acute by virtue of this <i>sutra</i>; the word मत्स &c. being <i>jati</i> words having a penultimate य would not have taken <i>nip</i> [[4.1.63]] but for this <i>sutra</i>; श्वन् and तक्षन् would have taken डाप् [[4.1.13]], एषण is formed by ल्युट् and would have taken <i>nip</i> [[4.1.15]] इष्यतेऽनया = एषणी 'a balance, a probe'. गौतम would take <i>nin</i> also by [[4.1.73]]. Similarly it may be shown why the several words have been included in this list. By the <i>vartika</i> मातरि षिच्च given under [[4.2.36]], the affix आमह in मातामह is treated as having an indicatory ष ॥ The word मातामह will take ङीष् because it is षित्; its inclusion in the list of <i>Gauradi</i> indicates that the rule of ङीष् application, because a word is षित्, is not universal (अनित्यः षिल् लक्षणो ङीष्) ॥ Therefore we have forms like दंष्ट्रा &c.",
    "41042": "Thus जानपदी 'a profession', otherwise जानपदी, the difference being in accent only. For this word is formed by adding the affix अञ् to <i>janapada</i>, by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.86]], as it belongs to <i>Utsadi</i> class of words: in forming the feminine the affix ङीप् will be added in this latter case, thus throwing the acute accent on the first syllable.\n \n(2) So also कुण्डी 'bowl-shaped vessel', otherwise कुण्डा 'a name of <i>Durga</i>'. (3) गोणी 'a sack' यत्र धान्यादि प्रक्षिप्य नीयते otherwise गोणा, a particular name. (4) स्थली 'a place not prepared by artificial improvement'; otherwise स्थला as स्थलयोदकं परिगृह्णन्ति ॥ (5) भीजा 'cooked', otherwise भाजा, (6) नागा 'a stout woman', otherwise नागा ॥ The word नाग when a <i>guna</i>-<i>vachana</i> word i.e a word expressive of quality, in the sense of 'stoutness', takes the affix <i>nish</i> in the feminine; otherwise टाप् when expressing general qualities. When it is a <i>jati</i>-<i>vachana</i> word it takes ङीप् under all circumstances. (7) काली 'a black-coloured female', otherwise काला 'cruel' (8) नीली 'a blue-coloured animal or indigo' The word अनाच्छादन in the <i>sutra</i> is rather too wide, it should be confined to the two senses above indicated i. e. when it applies to a plant called indigo or to animals'. Such as नालागौः, or नीली वडवा; or when it denotes appellative as नीली ॥ In other cases we have नीला 'a blue-coloured cloth'. (9) कुशी 'a plough share', otherwise कुशा 'a rope or a kind of grass' (10) कामुकी 'a libidinous or lustful woman' otherwise कामुका 'a woman desirous of wealth'. (11) कबरी 'a fillet or braid of hair', otherwise कबरा 'mixed, variegated'.",
    "41043": "Thus शोणी or शोणा वडवा 'a red or bay mare'. By <i>Phit</i> <i>Sutra</i> II. 10 referred to already in [[4.1.39]] the <i>udatta</i> in शोणा falls on the first syllable, and by [[4.1.40]] it would have taken ङीष् always; but the present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i> rule and restricts the application of ङीष् according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians only, and not of others.",
    "41044": "The word गुणवचनः means what expresses quality: i.e. \"words not being words formed by primitive or secondary affixes, or other words entitled to the name of <i>sankhya</i> or <i>sarvanaman</i>, or <i>jati</i>, or compound words, provided they are words denoting qualities and capable of being used as adjectives qualifying substantives as the word शुक्ल is, not as the word रूप, which though it expresses a quality, cannot be used as an adjective.\" (Guide to <i>Panini</i>). Thus from पटु 'dexterous', we have पट्वी or पटुः (without a feminine affix); so मृदुः or मृद्वी 'soft'. Why do we say 'ending in a short उ'? Observe शुचिरियं ब्राह्मणी 'this <i>Brahmana</i> lady is pure'. Why do we say \"expressive of a quality? \" Observe आखुः 'a mouse' (both masculine and feminine).\n\nVart:- After the word वसु when expressive of a quality, the affix <i>nip</i> is employed in the feminine; in order to make the first syllable acutely accented. As, वस्वी ॥ वसु is formed by उ (<i>Vn</i>. I. 10) and is <i>adyudatta</i> because the उ is नित् ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated after the word खरु, and words though ending in short उ, have conjunct consonant as penultimate. As खरुरियं ब्राह्मणी 'a <i>Brahmani</i> who chooses her own husband'. Similarly पाण्डु is both gender, as ण्ड् is a conjunct consonant. As पाण्डुरियं ब्राह्मणी ॥\n\nThe word <i>Guna</i> गुणः 'quality' has been thus defined:-\n\nसत्वे निविशतेपैति पृथग् जातिषु दृश्यते ।\nआधेयश्चाक्रियाजश्च सोऽसत्त्वप्रकृतिर्गुणः ॥",
    "41045": "As बहुः or बह्वी ॥ The following are the words belonging to the <i>Bahvadi</i> class—\n\n1 बहु, 2 पद्धति, 3 अञ्चति, 4 अङ्कति, 5 अंहति, 6 शकटि, (शकति), 7 शक्तिः शस्त्रे, 8 शारि, 9 वारि, 10 राति 11 राधि, 12 शाधि, 13 अहि, 14 कपि, 15 यष्टि, 16 मुनि, 17 इतः प्राप्यंगात् । 18 कृदिकारादक्तिनः। 19 सर्वतोऽक्तिन्नर्थादित्येके। 20 चण्ड, 21 अराल, 22 कृपण, 23 कमल, 24 विकट, 25 विशाल, 26 विशङ्कट, 27 भरुज, 28 ध्वज, 29 चन्द्रभागान्नद्याम् (चन्द्रभागा नद्याम्) 30 कल्याण, 31 उदार, 32 पुराण, 33 अहन्, 34 क्रोड, 35 नख, 36 खुर, 37 शिखा, 38 बाल, 39 शफ, 40 गुद ॥ आकृतिगणोऽयम् ॥ तेन । 43 भग, 44 गल, 45 राग इत्यादि ॥\n\nThe affix <i>nish</i> also comes optionally after words ending in short इ being the names of the limbs of animals; as, धमनिः or धमनी ॥ So also after the vowel इ of a <i>krit</i> affix, not क्तिन् [[3.3.94]], as रात्रि or रात्री ॥ Some say that the feminine affix <i>nish</i> may come after any word ending in इ, if it has not the force of the affix क्तिन् ॥ The word बहु is a <i>guna</i>-word and would have optionally taken <i>nish</i> even by the last <i>sutra</i>, its specification here is for the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, by which it necessarily takes <i>nish</i> in the <i>Chhandas</i>. It is an <i>Akritigana</i>",
    "41046": "Thus बह्वीषु हित्वा प्रपिवन् ॥ Here बह्वी is the name of a herb.\n\nThe word नित्य 'always' is used in the aphorism, more for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, which it governs than for this <i>sutra</i>. For the word 'optionally' does not govern this, and the aphorism even without the word '<i>nitya</i>'? would have been a necessary rule and not optional: for आरम्भसामर्थ्यादेव नित्योविधिः सिद्धः, योगारम्भश्चिन्त्य योजनः ॥",
    "41047": "Thus विभ्वी, प्रभ्वी, सुभ्वी, शम्भ्वी ॥\n\nBut why not so in the case of स्वयभूः? Because it ends in long ऊ, while विभ्वी &c. are feminine of विभु &c. ending in short उ ॥ In fact the word उतः \"after a word ending in short उ\" of <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.44]] governs this also. The word भुवः is the ablative case of भु irregularly formed by the substitution of उवङ्; this form being confined to <i>sutras</i> only.",
    "41048": "Relation (<i>yoga</i>) with a male (<i>punsa</i>) is called पुंयोग ॥ Thus the wife of गणक 'an astrologer' is called गणकी, so also महामात्री 'the wife of a chief minister', प्रष्ठी 'the wife of a chief'; प्रचरी &c. Thus the word गणक means an astrologer, a calculator or a mathematician; and the wife of such a person will be expressed by the word गणकी ॥ But if a woman is herself an astrologer &c, she will be called गणका ॥ (by टाप्) &c. Therefore when matrimonial relation is not denoted, this <i>sutra</i> will not apply.\n\nWhy do we say 'in relation to a husband'? Observe देवदत्ता यज्ञदत्ता 'two women of the names of <i>Devadatta</i>, and <i>Yajnadatta</i>, not wives of <i>Devadatta</i> and <i>Yajnadatta</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say \"आख्या or a name\"? The word formed will be the name of a woman whose husband is possessed of the quality denoted by the word, and not that the woman possesses that quality. In the case of a woman, therefore, the word is merely a Name or a Designation, and has no reference to the etymological meaning of the word. Moreover, the omission of the word आख्यायाम् would have made the <i>sutra</i> ambiguous, for the phrase  पुं योगाद् also means 'an effect produced by union with a man' such as pregnancy. And words परिसृष्टा and प्रजाता would have required ई and not आ ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of words like गोपालिक and the rest. Thus गोपालिका 'the wife of a cow-herd'.\n\nVart: The affix चाप् comes after सूर्य in denoting the wife of <i>Surya</i>, when she is a celestial being. As सूर्या 'the celestial wife of the god <i>Surya</i>', while सूरी will denote a human wife of <i>Surya</i>, such as, <i>Kunti</i> &c. The affix चाप् makes the word acutely accented on the final: for the word सूर्य has acute on the initial, and had ङीष् been only prohibited and no specific affix ordained, then टाप् would have applied, and it would have left the accent unchanged. Hence a distinct affix चाप् is ordained.",
    "41049": "The augment आनुक् is added to the Proper Nouns इन्द्र, वरुण, भव, शर्व, रुद्र, and मृड, and to the words हिम 'snow', अरण्य 'a forest', यव 'barley', यवन 'a <i>Yavana</i>', मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and आचार्य 'a preceptor', before the feminine affix ङीष् ॥\n\nThe present <i>sutra</i> teaches two things, the addition of the augment आनुक् (आन्) and secondly the feminine affix ङीष् ॥ Out of the above words, in case of those about which matrimonial relation is desired to be expressed, i. e. the Proper Nouns up to मृड, the present <i>sutra</i> teaches only the addition of the augment आनुक्, for in their case, the affix ङीष् would follow by force of the preceding <i>Sutra</i>. In the case of the remaining words, it teaches both these things.\nThus इन्द्राणी 'the wife of <i>Indra</i>', वरुणानी 'the wife of <i>Varuna</i>',  भवानी 'the wife of <i>Bhava</i>', शर्वाणी 'the wife of <i>Sarva</i>', रुद्राणी 'the wife of <i>Rudra</i>', मृडानि 'the wife of <i>Mrida</i>'.\n\nVart:- Of the words हिम and अरण्य, there is the augment अनुक् in the sense of greatness. Thu हिमानी 'a glacier, much snow', अरण्यानी 'a great forest'. Otherwise these words are always Neuter and never take feminine·\n\nVart:- After the word यव 'barley' the feminine affix and the augment are added in the sense of fault. The fault consists in its imitating barley while not being a barley. In fact the word denotes a new and inferior sort of grain. Thus यवानी \"a kind of grain, oat\".\n\nVart:- After the word यवन, the affix and the augment are added in the sense of handwriting. Thus यवनानी 'the written character of the <i>Yavanas</i>'.\n\nVart:- Of the words मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and उपाध्याय 'a preceptor', when the feminine affix comes to express the wife thereof, the augment आनुक् is optional. Thus मतुलानी or मातुली 'the wife of a maternal uncle' उपाध्यायानी or उपाध्यायी 'the wife of a preceptor'.\n\nVart:- And there is not the change to the lingual ण् of the dental न् of the augment आनुक् [[8.4.2]] after the word आचार्य ॥ Thus आचार्यानी or आचार्या 'the wife of a preceptor'.\n\nVart:- After the words अर्य and क्षत्रिय this rule applies optionally : when the matrimonial relation is not intended but the word retains its own sense. Thus अर्याणी or अर्या 'the female of the <i>Arya</i> or <i>Vaishya</i> class', क्षत्रियाणी or क्षत्रिया 'a female of the <i>Kshatriya</i> class'. When matrimonial relation is to be expressed, then only ङीष् is added. As अर्यी 'the wife of a <i>Vaishya</i>', क्षत्रियी 'the wife of a <i>Kshatriya</i>'.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, the affix ङीष् with the augment आनुक् is added to the word मुद्गल; and the affix is treated as if it had an indicatory ल् ॥ The force of the indicatory ल् is to make the vowel preceding the affix, take the acute accent (VI. 1. 193 लिति). Thus रथीरभून् मुद्गलानी गविष्टौ ॥ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> X. 102. 2).",
    "41050": "The word करणपूर्वम् means that compound in which the करण or 'means' is the first member. Thus वस्त्रक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for cloth'; so also वसनक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for dress'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when the first member of the compound is the name of the means\" ? Observe सुक्रीता 'well purchased', दुष्क्रीता 'ill-purchased'. But why is not the affix ङीष् employed in धनक्रीता in the following verse :-- सा हितस्यधनक्रीता प्राणेभ्योपि गरीयसी 'she purchased in exchange of riches is more dear to him than life'. Here the word क्रीत has first taken the affix टाप् forming क्रीता and then this feminine word is compounded with धन ॥ The general rule is गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सहसमासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः \"<i>Gati</i>, <i>Karakas</i> and <i>Upapadas</i> are compounded with bases that end with <i>Krit</i>-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter\". The word धनक्रीता is an exception, founded on the diversity allowed by कर्तृकरणे कृता बहुलम् [[2.1.32]].",
    "41051": "The word करण पूर्वात् 'preceded by a noun denoting the means where with', of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this also. The participle in क्त, must be preceded by a noun in the instrumental case, and the sense conveyed by क्त, to the action should give the sense of 'little', in connection therewith. The अल्पाख्यायाम् of the <i>sutra</i> qualifies the whole word. Thus अभ्रविलिप्ती द्यौः 'a sky covered slightly with clouds', सूपविलिप्ती पात्री 'a dish slightly covered with soup'.\n\nWhy do we say when the sense is that of 'little'? Observe चन्दनानुलिप्ता ब्राह्मणी \"a <i>Brahmani</i> lady covered with sandal essence?\"",
    "41052": "The word क्तात् of the last aphorism governs this also. This <i>sutra</i> applies to those <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds in which the first member is a <i>svanga</i> word. But if the antecedent member is not a <i>svanga word</i>, then the application of the rule is optional. As शंखभिन्नी 'having a rent on the temporal bone', ऊरुभिन्नी 'having a rent on the thigh'. गलकोत्कृन्नी (गलमुत्कृत्तमस्या), केशलूनी ॥ By [[2.2.36]] <i> Vart </i> जातिकालसुखादिश्यः परवचनम्, the <i>Nishtha</i> stands in the second place, otherwise by [[2.2.36]] it ought to have formed the first member of the compound. The words शंख &c. are <i>jati</i> words, and by [[6.2.170]], the acute is on the final.\n\nWhy do we say \"after a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound ?\" Observe पादपतिता which is an Ablative <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound [[2.2.38]]. The compounding is by [[2.1.32]], and it has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]].\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the participle जात 'born', which is also acutely accented on the final. Thus दन्तजाता 'a female who has cut her teeth;' स्तनजाता 'a female whose breast has been developed'. See [[2.2.36]] <i>Vart</i>.\n\nVart:- In the case of words पाणिगृहीती &c, the affix is employed in certain senses only. Thus पाणिगृहीती 'a wife'; (अग्निसाक्षिकं यस्याः पाणिर्गृह्यते); but पाणिगृहीता 'a woman whose hands have been taken, but not before the sacred fire, a concubine &c.'\n\nVart:- Exception must be stated in the case of compounds, the antecedent member of which is any one of the following words :- बहु, नञ, सु, words denoting time, सुख &c. Thus बहुकृता, अकृता, सुकृता, मासजाता, संवत्सरजाता, सुखजाता or दुःखजाता &c.\n\n<i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds get acute accent on the final syllable when they fall under the rules [[6.2.170]] and the following.",
    "41053": "The words अन्तोदात्तात् and क्तान्तात् govern this <i>sutra</i>. This aphorism lays down an option, where by the last aphorism, it would have been compulsory. Thus शार्ङ्गजग्ध, is a word having acute accent on the final [[6.2.170]], but as the first portion of this <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is not a <i>Svanga</i> word, but a <i>jati</i> word, its feminine will be शार्ङ्गजग्धी or शार्ङ्गजग्धा ॥ So also पलाण्डुभक्षिती or पलाण्डुभक्षिता and सुरापीती or सुरापीता.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the first member of the compound is not a <i>svanga</i> word'? Observe शंखभिन्नी, ऊरुभिन्नी which admit of only one form.\n\nIf the final is not acutely accented, the rule will not apply. As वस्त्रछन्ना and वसनछन्ना which are not acutely accented on the final (See VI. 2. 170), because the first member is a word denoting dress or आच्छादन, which is especially excepted from the scope of rule [[6.2.170]].\n\nVart:- Diversely in the <i>Chhandas</i> and in Names. As प्रवृद्धविलूनी or प्रवृद्धविलूना ॥",
    "41054": "The <i>Anuvritti</i> of the words बहुव्रीहेः, क्तान्तादन्तोदात्तात् does not extend to this aphorism. But the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word वा 'optionally' does extend to this <i>Sutra</i>. Thus चन्द्रमुखी or चन्द्रमुखा, अतिकेशी or अतिकेशा ॥ The word अतिकेशा  is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound meaning अतिक्रान्ता केशान्, and केश is <i>upasarjana</i> by [[1.2.44]].\n\nWhy do we say \"what ends with the name of a part of the body\"? Observe बहुयवा 'having much barley'. Why do we say \"subordinate in a compound\"? Witness अशिखा \"without crest\" (where the शिखा is not subordinate or epithetical). Why do we say \"not having a conjunct for its penultimate letter\"? Witness सुगुल्फा, सुपार्श्वा ॥\n\nVart :- This rule applies to a compound ending with the word अङ्ग, गात्र and कण्ठ, though in all these, the penultimate is a double consonant. Thus मृद्वङ्गी or मृद्वङ्गा; सुगात्री or सुगात्रा, स्निग्धकण्ठी or स्निग्धकण्ठा ॥\n\nThe word स्वांग has a technical meaning as given in the following verse:-\n\nअद्रवं मूर्तिमत्स्वाङ्गं प्राणिस्थमविकारजम् ।\nअतत्स्थं तत्रदृष्टं चेत् तेन चेत् तत्तथायुतम् ॥\n\nA word denoting a thing which not being a fluid, is capable of being perceived by the senses because of its having a form, is <i>svanga</i>; it must exist in a living being, but not produced by a change from the natural state; or though found elsewhere actually, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.",
    "41055": "This is an exception to the last and the succeeding <i>sutra</i>. Some of the words above given are either such which have a conjunct penultimate letter, and thus beyond the scope of [[4.1.54]]; or they are polysyllabic words and thus covered by [[4.1.56]]. Though this rule is an exception to [[4.1.54]] and [[4.1.56]]; yet it is qualified by (IV. I. 57). Thus तुङ्गनासिका or तुङ्गनासिकी, तिलोदरी or तिलोदरा, बिम्बोष्ठी or बिम्बोष्ठा, दीर्घजंघी or दीर्घजंघा, समदन्ती or समदन्ता, चारुकर्णी or चारुकर्णा, तीक्ष्णसृङ्गी or तीक्ष्णशृङ्गा ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word पुच्छ 'tail'. As कल्याणपुच्छा or कल्याणपुच्छी ॥\n\nVart:- The affix <i>nish</i> comes necessarily and not optionally after compounds of पुच्छ with कबर, मणि, विष and शर ॥ As, कबरपुच्छी 'a peahen' मणिपुच्छी, विषपुच्छी, 'a scorpion' and शरपुच्छी ॥\n\nVart:- So also the feminine affix <i>nish</i> is necessarily employed after the words पक्ष and पुच्छ when used as a simile or as objects of comparison. As उलूकपक्षी सेना, उलूकपुच्छी शाला ॥",
    "41056": "The class क्रोड् &c. is <i>akriti</i>-<i>gana</i>, that is a class of words constituted by usage. The following are some of the examples:- As कल्याणक्रोडा, कल्याणखुरा, कल्याणोखा, कल्याणबाला, कल्याणशफा, कल्याणगुदा, कल्याणघाणा ॥ So also सुभगा, सुगला, &c. Of the case where the word is polysyllabic, the examples are सुजघना, पृथुजघना, महाललाटा, ॥ The word कोडा is feminine itself, and in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> the feminine sign of the first member is elided by <i>pungvad</i>-<i>bhava</i>, and क्रोडा is shortened to क्रोड because it is an <i>upasarjana</i> (1. 2. 48).",
    "41057": "Thus सकेशा, अकेशा विद्यमानकेशा ॥ So also सनासिका अनासिका or विद्यमाननासिका ॥ The last example shows, that the present rule governs also [[4.1.55]] <i>ante</i>: as well as [[4.1.54]].",
    "41058": "Thus शूर्प + नखा, = शूर्पणखा, '<i>Surpanakha</i> the sister of <i>Ravana</i>'. The न् is changed into ण् by [[8.4.3]] (पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायामगः) ॥ So also वज्रणखा, गौरमुखा, कालमुखा &c. Why do we say 'when denoting a Name'? Witness ताम्रमुखी कन्या 'a copper-faced damsel', or चन्द्रमुखी 'moon-faced'.",
    "41059": "The word दीर्घजीह्वी is the feminine of दीर्घजीह्व but as the latter has a conjunct consonant for its penultimate, the feminine affix ङीष् would not have applied to it by [[4.1.54]]. The present aphorism enjoins ङीष् ॥ Thus दीर्घजीह्वी in the sentence दीर्घजीह्वी वै देवानां हव्यमलेट् ।\n\nThe word च 'and' in the aphorism is used in order to draw in the word संज्ञा from the last, so that the word <i>dirgha</i>-jihvi is always a Name. Moreover by using the feminine form <i>dirgha</i>-jihvi in the <i>sutra</i>, it is indicated that the application of ङीष् is necessary and not optional, as was the case in the last <i>sutras</i>.",
    "41060": "This aphorism over-rules all the rules and prohibitions contained in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.54]] to [[4.1.58]]. Whereever by those rules there would have been ङीष्, the present enjoins ङीप् instead. Though the form will be the same, the difference will be in the accent; the affix ङीप् being <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. Thus प्राङ्मुखी or प्राङ्मुखा, प्राङ्नासिकी or प्रांनासिका, But not so in प्राग्गुल्फा; प्राक्क्रोडा or प्राग्जघना because these words do not take ङीष् (by (IV. I. 56)), therefore they never give occasion to the application of ङीप् ॥ The <i>sutra</i> ought to be read as if it contained two rules (1) the affix ङीष् comes after a compound the first member of which is a word denoting direction and the second is a <i>svanga</i> word or is the word नासिका &c. the penultimate not being a conjunct consonant, (2) but ङीष् is not added to Compounds ending in क्रोड &c. or in a word of more than two syllables. In other words the <i>sutra</i> may be translated \"ङीप् is the substitute of ङीष् when the first member is a word denoting direction\". Therefore the affix ङीप् will come only there, where else the affix ङीष् would have come and not otherwise. This is the reason why the <i>anuvritti</i> of ङीष् is taken in the next <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.61]] and not that of ङीप् ॥",
    "41061": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of ङीष् is to be taken in this aphorism and not that of ङीप्, though the latter was nearer. The word वाह् is formed from the root वाह् with the affix ण्वि [[3.2.64]]. The word वाह् is never found alone, but as ends of compounds, hence we apply the rule of <i>tadanta</i>, and have translated it by saying a \"word ending in <i>vah</i>.\" Thus दित्यौही 'sustaining the demon'. This form is thus evolved :- दित्य + वाह् + ङीष् = दित्य + ऊठ् + आह् + ङीष् ([[6.4.132]] वाह ऊठ्, <i>Uth</i> is the <i>samprasarana</i> of <i>vah</i>, when this is a <i>bha</i>) = दित्य + ऊह् + ङीष् [[6.1.108]] संप्रसारणाच्च 'after a <i>samprasarana</i> if a vowel follow, the form of the prior is the single substitute'), = दित्यौही ([[6.1.89]] एत्येधत्यूठ्सु '<i>vriddhi</i> is the single substitute when <i>eti</i>, <i>edhati</i> or <i>uth</i> follow'). Similarly प्रष्ठौही 'a young heifer training for the plough.'",
    "41062": "Thus सखीयं मे ब्राह्मणी, and नास्याः शिशरस्तीति = अशिश्वी ॥ Why do we say in vernacular Sanskrit ? Observe सखा सप्तपदी भव and अशिशुमिव मामयं शिशुरभिमन्यते ॥\n\nSometimes we find these forms in the Vedas also, though rarely, as आधेनवो धुनयन्तामशिश्वी ॥ सखी सप्तपदी भव ॥",
    "41063": "The word जाति was defined under <i>Sutra</i> [[1.2.52]]. Thus कुक्कुटी 'a hen'; सूकरी 'a she-hog', ब्राह्मणी '<i>Brahmani</i>'; वृषली 'a woman of the <i>Sudra</i> caste', नाडायनी 'a woman of <i>Nadayana</i> class', चारायणी 'a <i>Charayani</i>', कटी 'a woman of <i>Brahmans</i> who read the <i>Katha</i>', बह्वृची 'a woman of the class of <i>Brahmans</i> who read the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>'.\n\nWhy do we say \"expressive of a <i>jati</i>\"? Observe मुण्डा 'shaven' ( where the word expresses not a <i>jati</i> but a quality). Why do we say \"not invariably feminine\"? Witness मक्षिका 'a fly' (supposed to breed without a male). Why do we say \"not having the letter य् for its penultimate?\" Witness क्षत्रिया 'a female of the <i>Kshatriya</i> class'.\n\nVart:- In excluding words that have the letter य् as penultimate, there is not involved the exclusion of the following words which have a penultimate य्) viz, गवय 'the Bos Gaveans', हय 'horse', मुकय 'a sort of animal', मत्स्य 'a fish', and मनुष्य 'a man'. Thus गवयी, हयी, मनुषी, ([[6.4.150]] हलस्तद्धितस्य 'there is elision of the य् of a <i>taddhita</i> affix coming after a consonant when long ई follows') मत्सी ॥ The य् of <i>matsya</i> is elided by the <i>vartika</i> 'मत्स्यस्य ङ्याम्' ॥ See also [[6.4.149]]. All these words are also included in the class गौरादि (IV. I. 41.) and would have taken ङीष् independently of this <i>vartika</i>.\n\nAnother definition of <i>jati</i> is:-\n\nप्रादुर्भावविनाशाभ्यां सत्यस्य युगपद्गुणैः ।\nअसर्वलिंगां बह्वर्यो तां जातिं कवयो विदुः ॥ (See translation under [[1.2.52]])",
    "41064": "Here the affix applies to words which in their original sense denoted females and therefore were not provided by the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus ओदनपाकी, शंककुर्णी, शालपर्णी, शंखपुष्पी, दासीफली दर्भमूली, and गोवाली ॥\n\nWhen, however the affix ङीष् is not intended to be applied to compounds ending with फल, पुष्प, and मूल, then those compounds will fall under <i>Ajadi</i> class [[4.1.4]]; such as संफला, भस्त्रफला, सत्पुष्पा, अमूला &c.",
    "41065": "Thus अवन्ती 'women of <i>Avanti</i>', कुन्ती 'women of <i>Kunti</i>', दाक्षी '<i>Dakshi</i>'. Thus अवन्ति + ञ्यङ् [[4.1.171]] आवन्त्यः 'men of <i>Avanti</i>'. In the feminine this affix by [[4.1.176]] is elided. प्लाक्षी \"the female descendants of <i>Plaksha</i>\". Why do we say \"ending in short इ\"? Witness विट् '<i>Vaishya</i>', दरत् '<i>Darat</i>'. Why do we say \"of men\"? Witness तित्तिरिः 'partridge'. Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word जाति could have been read into this aphorism from [[4.1.63]], its repetition here indicates that ङीष् is to be applied even when the penultimate letter is य् Thus औदमयी ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies to words ending in the <i>taddhita</i> affix इञ् [[4.2.80]] though they do not denote a <i>jati</i> Thus सौतंगमी, मौनचित्ती ॥ The affix इञ् here referred to is the quadruply significant affix taught in [[4.2.80]] and ordained to come after सुतंगम &c, and does not denote a <i>jati</i>.",
    "41066": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words मनुष्यजाति and अयोपधात् should be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete it. Thus कूरूः 'a female of the country of the <i>Kurus</i>' ब्रह्मबन्धूः \"a <i>Brahmani</i> of the class of the fallen <i>Brahmans</i> so called\", जीवबन्धूः \"a woman of the <i>Jivabandhu</i> class\".\n\nThus कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः [[4.1.172]], and this affix is elided by [[4.1.176]] in the feminine.\n\nThe indicatory letter ङ् in ऊङ् is to distinguish this affix in <i>Sutras</i> like नोङ् धात्वोः [[6.1.175]], for had the affix been enunciated merely as ऊ, then the <i>Sutra</i> [[6.1.175]] would have run as नो धात्वोः and the sense would have been ambiguous, for we could not have known what affix was particularly meant there.\n\nThe long ऊ is taught to debar the affix कप्, for a short उ would have also given the form करू (कुरु + उ = कुरू) ॥ The long ऊ therefore, indicates that the affix कप्, enjoined by [[5.4.154]], in <i>Bahuvrihis</i>, will not apply in the feminine forms ब्रह्मबन्धूः and the like, by the rule of <i>vipratishedha</i>.\n\nWhy do we say \"not having the letter य् as its penultimate\"? Witness अध्वर्युर्ब्राह्मणी 'a woman of the class of <i>Brahmanas</i> versed in the <i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i>'.\n\nVart:- The affix ऊङ् comes under similar conditions after words denoting non-animate <i>jati</i>, except the words रज्जु &c. Thus अलाबूः 'the bottle gourd'; कर्कन्धूः 'the jujube tree.' Why do we say \"non-animate\"? Witness कृकवाकुः 'a kind of lizard.' Why do we say \"except the word <i>rajju</i> &c\" Witness रज्जुः 'rope'; हनुः 'cheek' &c.",
    "41067": "Thus भद्रबाहूः '<i>Bhadrabahu</i>'; जालबाहूः &c. Why do we say in \"expressing a Name\"? Observe वृत्तबाहूः 'a woman having rounded hand' which is an attributive word. In other words, when the compound is a name, बाहु takes long ऊ in the feminine.",
    "41068": "As पंगू 'a female lame'.\n\nVart:- The feminine affix ऊङ् is added to श्वशुर, and thereby there is elision of the letter उ and of the letter अ of the word. As श्वश्रूः 'mother-in-law' This debars the <i>punyoga</i> ङीष् of [[4.1.48]].",
    "41069": "Thus कदलास्तम्भोरूः 'a female with thighs like plantain-stem'. नागनासोरूः 'a female with thighs like the nose of an elephant';  करभोरूः 'female with thighs like the ulnar or tapering fleshy side of the hand'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when expressing an object of comparison\"? Witness वृत्तोरूः स्त्री 'a woman with round thighs'. The word करेणुकरोरु \"thigh like the proboscis (कर)of an elephant (करेणु)\" is a poetic irregularity in the following विचकरे च करेणुकरोरुभिः ॥",
    "41070": "This aphorism applies, when no comparison is intended. As संहितोरूः 'a female whose thighs are joined (e.g. from obesity)' शफोरूः 'whose thighs are put together like the two hoofs on a cow's foot,' लक्षणोरूः 'whose thighs are marked,' वामोरूः 'with handsome thighs.'\n\nVart:- So also with the words सहित and सह. As सहितोरूः and सहोरूः ॥",
    "41071": "Thus कद्रुश्चवै सुपर्णी च ॥ मास्मकमण्डलूं शूद्राय दद्यात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"in the Vedas.\" Witness कद्रुः and कमण्डलुः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words गुग्गुलु, मधु, जतु and पतयालुः ॥ Thus गुग्गुलूः, मधूः, जतूः, and पतयालूः ॥",
    "41072": "This rule applies to other than Vedic forms. Thus कद्रूः 'a female named <i>Kadru</i> wife of <i>Kasyapa</i>', कमण्डलूः '<i>Kamandalu</i>'. Why do we say \"in denoting a Name\"? Observe कद्रूः 'the tawny color.' कमण्डलूः 'a water-gourd'.",
    "41073": "Thus शार्ङ्गरवी 'a <i>Sarngrava</i> woman', कापटवी 'a <i>Kapatava</i> woman'. So also after a word formed with the affix अञ् (as ordained in S. 86, and 104 &c. of this chapter), as, बैदी 'a female descendant of <i>Bida</i>'. और्वी 'a female descendant of <i>Urva</i>'. This <i>sutra</i> applies to words expressing <i>jati</i> or kind. In other words, this aphorism debars the affix ङीष् of [[4.1.63]] &c. where it came after <i>jati</i>-<i>vachaka</i> words; but it does not debar that ङीष् which is employed in describing the relation of wife, such as, the ङीष् of [[4.1.48]].\n\nThe difference between ङीष् and ङीन् consists in accent only, the resultant forms otherwise being the same. The words formed by ङीन् will have <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् ([[6.1.197]] a word ending with an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable') : while the word formed by ङीष् will have acute accent on the affix. Thus बैदी 'a female descendant of <i>Bida</i>', and बैदी 'the wife of <i>Baida</i>'.\n\nThe following is a list of <i>Sarngaravadi</i> class words:-\n\n1 शार्गंरव, 2 कापटव, 3 गौग्गुलव, 4 ब्राह्मण, 5 बैद, 6 गौतम ॥ These words are formed by the affix अण् the first four being formed by the अण् of ( IV. 1. 83) from शृंगरु, कपटु, गुग्गुलु and ब्रह्मन्; the word गौतम is formed from गोतम by the अण् of [[4.1.114]]. This word is also included in <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.41]]. 7 कामण्डलेय, 8 ब्राह्मकृतेव, 9 आनिचेय, 10 आनिधेय, 11 आशीकेय ॥ These are formed by ढक् [[4.1.123]] except <i>kamandaleya</i> which is formed by ढञ् [[4.1.135]]. 12 वात्स्यायन, 13 मौञ्जायन ॥ These are formed by फक् of (IV. I. 101) and [[4.1.99]], and denote castes or <i>Gotra</i>. 14 कैकसेय is also formed by ढक् [[4.1.123]]. 15 काव्य 16 शैव्य are formed by ञ्यङ् [[4.1.171]]. 17 एहि, 18 पर्येहि are formed by इन् added to आ + इह् 'to try', and परि + आ + इह् (<i>Un</i> IV. 117 सर्व धातुभ्य इन्) 19 आश्मरथ्य is formed by यञ् [[4.1.105]]. 20 औदपान is formed by अण् [[4.3.76]]. 21 अराल, 22 चण्डाल, 23 वतण्डः are <i>jati</i> words. 24 भोगवत्, 25 गौरिमत् ॥ These take ङ्गीन् when denoting a Name. These words are formed by the affix मतुप्, and are consequently उगित्, and should have taken ङीप् [[4.1.6]]. This ordains ङीन् ॥\n\nQ. The word भोग is formed by घञ् and गौरि is formed by इञ् [[4.1.95]], both are <i>adyuddatta</i> owing to ञ् [[6.1.197]]. When मतुप् is added, the accent remains unchanged, for <i>matup</i> being पित् is <i>anudatta</i> (I11. 1. 4). Therefore whether ङीप् be added or ङीन् to these words, it makes no difference in the accent, for they remain <i>adyudatta</i>. Where is the necessity of including these two words in this list.\n\nAns. To this we reply घादिषु नित्यम् हृस्वार्थम् ॥ For had these words taken ङीप् of [[4.1.6]], then the long ई would have been optionally shortened before the affixes घ &c. by [[6.3.45]]. But by taking ङीन् the shortening is compulsory [[6.3.43]], and not optional. Because the च in the <i>sutra</i> उगितश्च [[6.3.45]] has the force of the word इति, and means the नदी words formed by adding ई to उगित् words, by enunciating the word उगित् are optionally shortened. Therefore [[4.1.6]] where the word उगित् is used is governed by this rule of optional shortening, and not the words formed by ङीन् ॥\n\n26 नृ 27 नर. The word नृ would have taken ङीप् by [[4.1.5]], and नर would have taken ङीष् as it denotes a <i>jati</i>. These words take <i>vriddhi</i> before ङीन्, the form being नारी in both cases.",
    "41074": "The affix यङ् here denotes and includes both the affixes ञ्यङ् (as taught in S. 171 of this chapter) and ष्यङ् (See 78) as it is the common element of both. Thus आम्बष्ठ्या 'woman of the race of <i>Ambashthya</i>', ससुवीर्या 'a woman of the race of <i>Sauvirya</i>', कौसल्या 'a woman of the race of <i>Kausalya</i>'.\n\nSimilarly ष्यङ् formed words, as, कारीषगन्ध्या, वाराह्या; बालाक्या ॥\n\nVart:- The affix चाप् comes in the feminine after a word ending with the affix यञ् when the letter ष् immediately precedes such <i>yan</i>. As शार्कराक्ष्य 'a female descendant of <i>Sarkaraksha</i>', पौतिमाष्या 'a female descendant of <i>Putimashya</i>', गौकाक्ष्या 'a female descendant of <i>Gokasha</i>'. These words belong to <i>Gargadi</i> class (IV. I. 105), and by <i>sutra</i> 16 would have taken ङीप् ॥\n\nThe प् of the affix चाप् is for the sake of forming a common term आप् with डाप् and टाप्; and the च regulates the accent making the final acute (VI. I. 163). The word गौकाक्ष्य is included in <i>Kraudadi</i> list [[4.1.80]] and takes the augment ष्यङ् in the feminine, and hence it would have taken चाप् by force of the present <i>sutra</i> and need not be included in the <i>Vartika</i>. There is no <i>Samprasarana</i> of the य when पुत्र or पति is added to this word [[6.1.13]], the form being गौकाक्ष्यापुत्रः and not गौकाक्षीपुत्रः ॥",
    "41075": "The word अवट belongs to <i>Gargadi</i> class [[4.1.105]] which after taking यञ्, would have taken ङीप् (IV. I. 16). Thus आवट्या 'a female descendant of <i>Avata</i>'. But आवट्यायनी will be the proper form according to the Eastern Grammarians. See aphorism [[4.1.17]].",
    "41076": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing <i>sutra</i>. Up to the end of the Fifth Book, all the affixes that will be taught, are to be understood to have the name of <i>Taddhita</i>. Thus the affix ति taught in the very next <i>sutra</i>. As युवतिः The word so formed is called <i>Pratipadika</i>. The word तद्धिताः is in the  number, and not exhibited in the singular, like the words प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1) &c; and it, therefore, indicates that it includes also affixes which are not especially taught in this book. Such as पृथिव्य ञाञौ॥ अग्रादि पश्चाड् डिमच् ॥ As पार्थिव, अग्रिम, आदिम, पश्चिम ॥ See <i>Vart</i> IV. 3. 23. The word <i>Taddhita</i> is used in <i>Sutras</i> like कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च [[1.2.46]].",
    "41077": "As युवतिः 'a young maid'. By [[4.1.5]], ङीप् would have been otherwise employed, the present <i>sutra</i> debars it. The word युवति ending in इ does not take the affix ङीष् of [[4.1.65]], for the affix ति itself is a feminine-making affix though a <i>Taddhita</i>: or the word युवन् may be regarded as a non-<i>jati</i> word and hence [[4.1.65]] would not apply.",
    "41078": "The wording of this aphorism requires a little analysis. It consists of five words: (1) अणिञोः 'of अण् and इञ्' (2) अनार्षयोः 'of non-<i>rishi</i>' (3) गुरूपोत्तमयोः 'having a heavy vowel as <i>upottama</i> i. e. last but one,' (4) ष्यङ 'the substitute is <i>shyan</i>' (5) गोत्रे 'in denoting <i>gotra</i>.' That is to say, the <i>gotra</i> affixes अण् and इञ् are replaced by ष्यङ् before the feminine affix चाप्, in those words which denoting non-<i>rishi</i> <i>gotras</i>, have a heavy vowel as last but one. The word <i>uttama</i> meaning last letter, being formed by the superlative affix <i>tamap</i>, implies that the word must be of at least three syllables. Therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> does not apply to forms like दाक्षि &c.\n\nOf the substitute ष्यङ् the letter ष् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is य, the letter ष् differentiating this affix from ञ्यङ् and the letter ङ् affording a common hold for both. In forming the feminine we shall have to add चाप् by [[4.1.74]]. Thus करीषगन्धि 'having the smell of dung-cake', is the name of a person. In forming a patronymic from this word, we add the affix अण् ॥ Thus करीषगन्धि + अण् [[4.1.92]] Replace this affix by ष्य and we have कारीषगन्ध्या ॥ कुमुदगन्धि  gives us कौमुदगन्ध्या ॥ Similarly with words taking the affix इञ् (as taught in <i>sutra</i> अतइञ् [[4.1.75]]: as वाराहिः gives us वाराह्या, so also बालाक्या ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of अण् and इञ् ॥ Witness आर्तभागा from ऋतभाग ॥ Here the word ऋतभाग belongs to बिदादि  <i>gana</i>, and therefore by [[4.1.104]], it would take the affix अञ् in forming <i>gotra</i> patronymic: this affix अञ् is not replaced by ष्यङ्, and the feminine is by long ई [[4.1.15]]; for though, its last vowel but one is heavy, it is a non-<i>rishi</i> <i>gotra</i> word, yet it does not fulfil the other condition of taking the affix अण् or इञ् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of non-<i> rishi</i> <i>gotras</i>'? Witness वासिष्ठी and वैश्वामित्री ॥ Why do we say 'whose last vowel but one is heavy'? Observe औपगवी and कापटवी ॥ Why do we say 'denoting <i>Gotra</i>?' Witness आहिच्छत्री 'born in <i>Ahichhatra</i>', कान्यकुब्जी 'born in <i>Kanyakubja</i>'.",
    "41079": "The phrase अणिञोः of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this also, not so, however, the word अगरूपोत्तमः ॥ The phrase गोत्रावयव means insignificant or non-famous <i>gotras</i>. i. e. names of <i>kulas</i> i. e. कुलाख्या, such as families like पुणिक, भुणिक, मुखर which are not famous and are not included in the <i>gotra</i> list. Thus पौणिक्या, भौणिक्या and मौखर्या ॥\n\nThe word अवयव in the <i>sutra</i> has various significations, one sense being 'separate from', another being 'part of', and 'individual members' &c. If the last sense be taken, then we can evolve forms like दैवदत्त्या याज्ञदत्या ॥ These forms may also be explained by taking them as belonging to the कौड्यादि class of the next aphorism. In short, those who wish to apply this aphorism to 'the immediate descendant', such as 'the son or daughter', and not to a <i>gotra</i> descendant, which means a grandson and down; can also do so.\n\nIn fact the word गोत्रावयव is equal to अवयवगोत्र or अप्रधानगोत्र and is a <i>karmadharaya</i> <i>samasa</i>, namely <i>gotras</i> not enumerated in the प्रवराध्यायः ॥ These are, however technically called कुल ॥",
    "41080": "This rule applies even where the syllable next to the final is not heavy, and even where the word does not take the affix अण् or इञ् ॥ In fact ष्यङ् is not a substitute here but an augment. Thus क्रौड्या 'a female <i>Kraudi</i>' लाड्या 'a female <i>Ladi</i>'. The following is the list of <i>Kraudadi</i> words:-\n\n1 क्रौडि, 2 लाडि, 3 व्याडि, 4 आपिशालि, 5 आपक्षिति. These are formed by इञ् [[4.1.95]]. 6 चौपयत, 7 चैटयत (वैटयत), 8 सैकयत (शैकयत) 9 वैल्वयत (वैकल्पयत्), These are formed by the affix अण् ॥ 10 सौधातकि. This is formed by इञ् with the substitute अकङ् [[4.1.97]] added to सुधातृ ॥ 11 सूतयुवत्याम् The word सूत takes ष्यङ् when denoting a grown-up maiden as सूत्याः; otherwise सूता 'a daughter', formed by टाप्, or सूती by ङीष् denoting a <i>jati</i>. 12 भोज क्षत्रिये ॥ This debars ङीष् of <i>jati</i> as भोज्याः, otherwise टाप् as भोजाः (भोजयति), 13 यौतकि, 14 कौटि, 15 भौरिकी, 16 भौलिकि, 17 शाल्मलि, 18 शालास्थलि, 19 कापिष्ठलि, 20 गौकक्ष्य (गौलक्ष्य) ॥ All these except the last are formed by इञ्, the last is formed by यञ् of <i>Gargadi</i> class.",
    "41081": "These words end in the affix इञ्, and the word <i>gotra</i> is not understood in the <i>sutra</i>. In the case of <i>gotra</i> descendants, the substitute <i>shyan</i> would have come by (IV. 1. 78.) but whereas by that <i>sutra</i> it would have been compulsory, the present aphorism makes it optional. But if the <i>sutra</i> be taken to apply to 'immediate descendants' as opposed to <i>gotra</i> descendants, then this is a new rule altogether and not a rider to [[4.1.87]]. In the alternative when ष्यङ् is not added, ङीष् will be added by rule [[4.1.65]] <i>ante</i>. Thus दैवयज्ञ्याor दैवयज्ञी, so also शौचिवृक्ष्या or शौचिवृक्षी, सात्यमुग्र्या or सात्यमुग्री, काण्ठेविद्ध्या or काण्ठेविद्धी ॥",
    "41082": "All the three words, viz. (1) समर्थानां 'of the words in construction' (2) प्रथमात् 'after the first'; (3) वा 'on the alternative', exert a governing influence on the subsequent aphorisms, up to the aphorisms which leave to the words their own denotation : that is to say, up to the end of the second chapter of the fifth Book; before the beginning of the <i>sutra</i> प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः [[5.3.1]]. The present <i>sutra</i> as a whole, of course, has no applicability to the affixes which leave to the words their own denotation (स्वार्थिक); for the latter affixes are in many cases compulsory and not optional, as are the affixes to be taught hereafter in Book Fourth and the first and second chapters of Book Fifth.\n\nThese affixes will come after the word, that is signified by the first of the words in construction, in an aphorism. Thus [[4.1.92]] declares तस्यापत्यम् 'his son'. Here the first word is तस्य 'his', therefore, the affixes forming the patronymics will come after the word signified by 'his': i.e. after the word in the genitive case. As उपगोरपत्यं = ओपगवः 'the son of <i>Upagu</i>'. Here the affix अण् comes after the word उपगु which is the first word representing '<i>tasya</i>' in the genitive case in the sentence उपगोरपत्यम् ॥ Similarly in the <i>sutra</i> तेनरक्त रागात् [[4.2.1]]; here the first word is तेन, therefore, the affix will be added to the word in the instrumental case in a sentence representing the word तेन 'by which'; as कषायेण रक्तं वस्त्रं = काषायं, '<i>Kashaya</i> is a cloth, coloured by <i>Kashaya</i>'. Similarly in <i>sutra</i> तत्र भवः 'there staying' (IV. 3. 53.) here the first word is तत्र, 'there', in the locative case, therefore the affix will be optionally added to the word in the locative case in a sentence, representing the word तत्र 'there' : as स्रुघ्ने भवः = स्रौघ्नः \"who stays in <i>Srughna</i>'.\n\nThe word समर्थानाम् is the genitive plural of समर्थ, and the force of the genitive is that of specification or '<i>nirdharana</i>':- i. e. 'among the words in construction, the first is specifically pointed out as the <i>prakriti</i> or base, to which the affix is to be added'. Why do we say \"among the words in construction\"? Witness कम्बल उपगोरपत्यं देवदत्तस्य 'the blanket of <i>Upagu</i>; the son of <i>Devadatta</i>'. Here the two words उपगोरपत्यं are not in construction, for उपगोः governs कम्बलः, and अपत्यं is governed by देवदत्तस्य ॥ Why do we say \"after the first\"? So that the affix may come after the first word उपगोः in the genitive case, and not after अपत्यं which is in the nominative case, Why do we say \"in the alternative\" ? Because the same idea may also be expressed by a sentence; thus we may say उपगोरपत्यं, instead of the <i>Taddhita</i> formed word औपगवः ॥ The same idea may also be expressed by a compound word (<i>samasa</i>); as उपग्वपत्यम् 'the son of <i>Upagu</i>'. In fact, the <i>samasa</i> rule here is not superseded by <i> Taddhita</i>-rule, as it otherwise would have been by (1. 4. 2.) because the <i>anuvritti</i> of अन्यतरस्याम् is understood here: so that in the alternative when the <i>Taddhita</i> affix is not employed, the <i>samasa</i> rules will find scope.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> has been thus rendered by Dr. Bohtlingk: \"when hence forth the meaning is specified in which an affix is to be added, then one should know that the rule applies to the first of those words which are associated with one another in sense, and that the affix is optional\".",
    "41083": "Up to aphorism [[4.4.2]], the affix अण् has a governing influence, except where it is specifically superseded by any particular rule. This aphorism may be looked upon either as an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> or a <i>paribhasha</i> <i>sutra</i> or a <i>vidhi</i> <i>sutra</i>. The application of this aphorism will be illustrated throughout the next three chapters. Thus in [[4.1.92]] तस्यापत्यम् we read the present aphorism and add the affix अण् in the sense of 'his son'. As औपगवः 'the son of उपगुः'; कापटवः 'the son of <i>Kapatu</i>'.\n\nThis affix has various meanings, such as, a patronymic [[4.1.92]], coloured with [[4.2.1]], sidereal time [[4.1.3]], revealed <i>sama</i>-<i>veda</i> [[4.1.7]], covered car [[4.2.10]] &c.",
    "41084": "This is an exception to the next aphorism, by which the affix ण्य would have come after words ending with '<i>pati</i>.' The present <i>sutra</i> enjoins अण् instead. Thus अश्वपति + अण् = आश्वपतम् [[7.2.117]] तद्धितेष्वचामादे 'when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix follows with an indicatory ञ् or ण्, there is <i>vriddhi</i> in the room of the first rowel among the vowels'). The इ of पति is elided by [[6.4.148]] यस्येति च where long ई follows, and when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix follows, there is elision of the इ or ई, or अ or आ, of a <i>bha</i>'.)\n\nThe following is a list of words belonging to अश्वपत्यादि class :-\n\nअक्षपति, 2 ज्ञानपति, 3 शतपति, 4 गणपति, 5 गणपति, 6 स्थानपति, यज्ञपति, 8 राष्ट्रपति, 9 कुलपति, 10 गृहपति, (पशुपति) 11 धान्यपति, 12 धन्वपति,13 बन्धुपति, 14 धर्मपति, 15 सभापति, 16 प्राणपति, 17 क्षेत्रपति ॥",
    "41085": "Thus दिति + ण्य = दैत्यः 'the son of <i>Diti</i>.' आदित्यः 'the descendant of <i>Aditi</i>', आदित्यम् ' sacred to <i>Aditya</i>.' Similarly with words ending with पति, as प्रजापति + ण्य = प्राजापत्यं; so also सैनापत्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word यम; as याम्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, after the words वाच्, मति and पितृमत् ॥ As वाच्यम् (<i>Vs</i>, 13, 58.) मात्यम् and पैतृमत्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes ञ् and अञ् come after the word पृथिवी ॥ Thus पृथिवी + ञ = पार्थिव; पृथिवी + अञ् = पार्थिव ॥ The resulting forms are the same, but the feminine of the former will be पार्थिवा by (IV. I. 4), and that of the latter पार्थिवी applying [[4.1.15]].\n\nVart:- The affixes यञ् and अञ् come after the word देव 'a god'. As दैव्यम् or दैवम् 'divine'.\n\nVart:- There is elision of the टि of बहिस्, and there is the affix यञ्; as बहिस् + यञ् = बाह्यः 'external'. Vart:- and the affix ईकक् may be employed. As बहिस् + ईकक् = बाहिकः 'external'. (VII. 2. 118 किति च, there is <i>vriddhi</i> of the first vowel when the <i>Taddhita</i> affix has an indicatory क्). Vart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> it takes the affix ईकञ् as बाहिकः the difference being in the accent [[6.1.197]].\n\nThe word बहिस् is an अव्यय, and the above <i>vartika</i> declares that its टि portion is elided. This very fact indicates by implication, that the टि of other <i>Avyayas</i> need not necessarily be elided before those affixes, before which the base is called भ <i>bha</i>. In fact the following <i>vartika</i> अव्यायानाञ्च (the टि of the <i>avyaya</i> base is elided) given under (sutra<i> [[6.4.144]] (the टि of the base </i>bha<i> is elided when a </i>taddhita<i> affix follows) is not a universal rule. Thus from the </i>avyaya<i> आरात् we get आराती &c; here the टि is not elided.\n\nVart:- Of the word स्थामन् the टि is replaced by अ as अश्वत्थामः ॥\n\nVart:- The टि of लोमन् is replaced by ञ in the plural when the patronymic affixes follow; as उडुलोमाः, शरलोमाः ॥ Why do we say in the plural number ? Witness औडुलोमिः, शारलोमिः [[4.1.99]].\n\nVart:- When an affix beginning with a vowel presents itself after the word गो, let the affix यत् be substituted for it. Thus what is descended (or produced, &c) from गो is expressed by गव्यम् [[6.1.79]]. Why do we say 'beginning with a vowel' ? Observe गोभ्यो हितं or आगतं = गोरूप्यम् and गोमयम् ॥\n\nVart:- These affixes ण्य &c, taught in this </i>sutra<i> will come, to the exclusion of all the other affixes hereinafter taught, which are employed in especial senses. Thus अण् is employed especially to denote a descendant. But after the words दिति &c अण् will not be employed, but ण्य, as दैत्य 'a descendant of दिति'. So also वानस्पत्यम् = (वनस्पतीनाम् समुहः), to the exclusion of [[4.2.37]] &c. In fact the rule for विप्रतिषेधे परंकार्य्यम् [[1.4.2]] does not hold good here.\n\nIf that be so, how do you explain the form दैतेयः ॥ This word is not directly formed from the word दिति but from दिती, the feminine of the word दिति, formed by the affix ङीष् [[4.1.45]], the word दिति being formed by the </i>Krit<i> affix क्तिन् and therefore it will take ङीष् in the feminine). To the feminine word दिती is added ढक् and we get दैतेयः ॥ The </i>Paribhasha<i> प्रातिपदिकग्रहणे लिङ्ग विशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम् (a rule of grammar which applies to a masculine applies also to the same word in the feminine) is not of universal application, as this very illustration shows. Others consider the form दैतेय as incorrect, as not to be found either in the </i>Mahabhashya<i> or any </i>Vartika_.",
    "41086": "This debars the affix अण् taught in [[4.1.83]] as well as the especial affixes here-in-after taught. Thus उत्स + अञ् = औत्सः, औदपानः ॥ The following is the list of words belonging to उत्सादि class.\n\n1 उत्स, 2 उदपान, 3 विकर, 4 विनद, 5 महानद 6 मदानस, 7 महाप्राण, 8 तरुण, 9 तलुन । 10 वष्कयासे । 11 पृथिवी, 12 धेनु, 13 पंक्ति, 14 जगती, 15 त्रिष्टुप्, 16 अनुष्टुभ्, 17 जनपद, 18 भरत, 19 उशीनर, 20 ग्रीष्म, 21 पीलुकुण. । 22. उदस्थान देशे । 23 पृष दंश, 24 भल्लकीय, 25 रथन्तर, 26 मध्यंदिन, 28 बृहत्, 28 महत्, 29 सत्त्वत्, 39कुरु, 31 पञ्चाल, 32 इन्द्रावसान, 33 उष्णिह्, 34 ककुभ्, 35 सुवर्ण, 35 देव, 37 ग्रीष्मादच्छन्दसि ॥\n\nVart:- The word ग्रीष्म in the above list, takes this affix, when it does not mean 'a metre of prosody'. Therefore it is not so here: ग्रैष्मी त्रिष्टुप् 'The <i>Graishmi</i> <i>Tristup</i> metre'. But ग्रैष्मः 'belonging to summer'. The word छन्दस् here means 'metre', and not <i>Veda</i>. The word बष्कयाऽसे = बष्कय असे, the phrase असे meaning असमासे, (स being the name given to समास by Ancient Grammarians). Thus the compound will be गोबष्कयिः ॥ The <i>Paribhasha</i> ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्त विधिप्रतिषेधः does not apply here. Therefore, <i>tadantavidhi</i> applies here and we have आधेनवम् (अधेनूनाम् समूहः) ॥ The word उदस्थान takes अञ् when meaning a 'place': as औदस्थानो देशः; otherwise औदस्थनिः 'the son of <i>Udasthana</i>'. The word पृषत् takes अञ् when meaning 'a share,' otherwise it will take अण्, as पार्षतोंऽशः ॥",
    "41087": "Thus स्त्री + नञ् = स्त्रैणम् 'feminine.' The sense of the affixes taught in the Fourth Book, and Chapter I of the Fifth Book, are various. Therefore the word स्त्रैणम् will have all those various significations; thus, it will mean either स्त्रीषुभवं [[4.3.53]] 'existing in females,' or स्त्रीणां संमूहः [[4.2.37]] 'a collection of females,; or स्त्रीभ्यआगतं [[4.3.74]] 'what has come from females'; or स्त्रीभ्यो हितं [[5.1.5]] 'suitable for females' &c.\n\nSimilarly पुंस + स्नञ् = पौंस्नम् 'masculine, or existing in males, or a collection of males, or what has come from males, or suitable for males &c.'\n\nThese affixes, however, are not to be employed in the sense of the affix वत् taught in [[5.1.115]]. For <i>Panini</i> himself uses the form पुंवत् (and not पौंस) in <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.34]], thus indicating by implication (ज्ञापक) that in the sense of वत्, the affix स्नञ् is not to be used. Thus स्त्रीवत्, ॥ The forms स्त्रीत्वं, स्त्रीता, पुंस्त्वं and पुंस्त्वा are exceptional. See [[5.1.121]]. The स् of पुंस् is elided before स्नञ् by (VIII. 2. 23.) had it not been elided, one affix नञ् would have been taught in the <i>sutra</i>, and not two.",
    "41088": "The phrase प्राग्दिव्यतः of [[4.1.83]] governs this aphorism also, and not the phrase भवनात् of the last. Thus पञ्चसु कपालेषु संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः 'prepared in five cups.' Similarly दशकपालः \"prepared in ten cups.\" द्विवेदः 'he who studies two Vedas.' त्रिवेदः \"who studies three Vedas.\" Here the affixes denoting संस्कृतं [[4.2.16]], and अधीते [[4.2.59]] have been elided. Why do we say \"not so when the affix denotes a Patronymic.\"? Observe द्वैदेवदत्तिः 'a descendant of two <i>Devadattas</i>.' त्रैदेवदत्तिः 'a descendant of three <i>Devadattas</i>.' Here the patronymic affix is not elided, though the compound is a <i>Dvigu</i>.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the sense of the various affixes taught antecedent to <i>tena</i> <i>divyati</i>?\" Observe द्वैपारायणिकः ॥\n\nThe <i>Dvigu</i> compound with the sense of a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is formed under [[2.1.51]]. The affix will not, therefore, be elided where it does not give rise to a <i>Dvigu</i> compound. Thus पञ्चकपालस्येदं = पाञ्चकपालम् ॥ Or the genitive case in द्विगोः may be taken as <i>sthana</i>-<i>shashthi</i>, the sense being 'there is the substitution of लुक्-elision in the room of <i>Dvigu</i>,' the word <i>Dvigu</i> being here taken by metonymy for the affix which gives rise to <i>Dvigu</i>. Of course, when two words have blended into a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, the affixes will not be elided after such a word, because it becomes a <i>pratipadika</i> like others, as पांचकपालम् ॥ If so, how is the affix elided in पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः ?This is not so; there is no <i>Taddhita</i> added, and the word पञ्चकपाल can never be analysed into पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः, ॥ If the latter sense is to be expressed, we must use a sentence, and no single word. In fact three are the only valid forms, and they arise without adding of any <i>Taddhita</i> affix to पञ्चकपाली, viz पञ्चसु कपालेषु संस्कृतः, पञ्चकपाल्लयां संस्कृतः, and पञ्चकपालः (a <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i>). A <i>Samahara</i> and a <i>Taddhitartha</i> <i>Dvigu</i> of these are analysed in the same way, while the third पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः will always remain a वाक्य and never give rise to a <i>Taddhita</i>.\n\nHow do you explain the non-elision of the affix in त्रैविद्यः, पाञ्चनदः and षाट्कुलः ? The word त्रैविद्यः does not mean तिस्रो विद्या अधीते but त्र्यवयवा विद्या, त्रिविद्या, त्रिविद्यामधीते = त्रैविद्यः ॥ Similarly पाञ्चनदः does not mean पञ्चसु नदीषु भवः but पंचानाम् नदीनाम् समाहारः = पंचनदः, पंचनदे भवः = पांचनदः ॥ So also with षाट्कुलं ॥\n\nWhy the affix is not elided in पंचभ्यो गर्गेभ्य आगतं = पंचगर्गरूप्यम् or पंचगर्गमयम् ? Because the elision of those affixes only take place which begin with a vowel.",
    "41089": "Thus the plural of गार्ग्य is गर्गाः [[2.4.64]]. But the disciples of गर्गाः will be formed by the affix छ (IV. 21. 114) which is a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix and for the purposes of adding this affix the base will be considered to be गार्ग्यः as if there was no elision. Thus गार्ग्याः + छ = गार्गीयाः [[7.1.2]] and [[6.4.151]], and not गर्गीयाः । Similarly वात्सीयाः, आत्रयीयाः, खारपायणीयाः 'disciples of <i>Vatsyas</i>, <i>Atreyas</i>, <i>Kharpayanas</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say \"गोत्रे\" i. e. \"when the <i>Gotra</i> affix is elided\"? Observe कौबलम्, बादरम् ॥ Here the affix denoting \"fruit\" is elided by लुक् by <i>Sutra</i> [[4.3.163]]. Then when the <i>pragdivytiya</i> affix अण् is added, the <i>luk</i>-elision is maintained. Thus the fruit of बदरी is बदरम्; from which बादरम् 'belonging to or coming from the jujube-fruit.'\n\nWhy do we say \"having an initial vowel\"? Observe गर्गेभ्य आगतम् = गर्गरूप्यम् and not गार्गरूप्यम्; and गर्गमयम्; and not गार्गमयम् ॥ Here the affix रूप्य, a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix taught in <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.81]] does not begin with a vowel; therefore it is added to गर्ग and not गार्ग्य ॥ Similarly the next affix मयट् [[4.3.82]].\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the sense of a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix\" ? Thus गर्गेभ्यो हितम् = गर्गीयम् 'who is fit for the <i>Gargas</i>'. Here the affix छ [[5.1.1]] has the sense of 'suitable for that', as taught in <i>Sutra</i> (V. I. 5) not one of the <i>pragdivyatiya</i> senses. Hence the <i>luk</i> elision is maintained.\n\nThe <i>Gotra</i>-affixes are taught to be elided in the plural only: and when after such supposed elision a Singular or Dual Person is intended, this rule will still apply and there will be no elision. Thus बिद will form its <i>Gotra</i> derivative by अञ् [[4.1.104]] as बिद + अञ् = बैदः ॥ The plural of बैद will be बिदाः by the elision of अञ् ॥ One <i>yuvan</i> or two <i>yuvan</i> descendants of these बिदाः will be formed by the affix इञ् [[4.1.95]], for the application of which the word बिदाः will be supposed not to have lost its अञ्, therefore इञ् will be added to बैद, thus बैद + इञ्; then this इञ् is elided by [[2.4.58]]. The resultant form is बैदः, बैदो ॥ The many descendants (in the plural) of one बैदः or two बैदः will be बिदाः ॥",
    "41090": "The elision of the <i>Yuvan</i> affix must take place mentally; having done which, we should then look out for the proper <i>Pragdivyatiya</i> affix to be added to the word-form thus remaining. Thus the Patronymic (¬<i>Gotra</i>) of फाण्टाहृतः is फाण्टाहृतिः [[4.1.95]] formed by adding इञ् ॥ The <i>Yuvan</i> form of the latter (by <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.150]]) will be फाण्टाहृतः  ॥ When we intend to add a <i>Pragdivyatiya</i> affix to this last word, (e. g. an affix having the sense of \"the pupils of\";) we should first mentally elide the <i>Yuvan</i> affix ण [[4.1.150]] from this word फाण्टाहृत ॥ Having done which we get the form फाण्टाहृति; and it is with regard to this form फाण्टाहृति that we should search out what is the proper pupil-denoting affix: and that by <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.112]] is अण् ॥ Thus फाण्टाहृति + अण् = फाण्टाहृताः 'the pupils of <i>Phantahritas</i>'. Had we in the first instance applied the pupil denoting affix to the <i>Yuvan</i> word फाण्टाहृत, such affix would have been छ and not अण्, for the latter is ordained for those cases only where the word ends with the <i>Gotra</i> affix इञ् [[4.2.112]].\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of भागवित्त is भागवित्ति [[4.1.25]]. The <i>Yuvan</i> of भागवित्ति is भागवित्तिकः [[4.1.148]]. The pupils of <i>Bhagavittika</i> will be भागवित्ताः by adding the affix अण् [[4.2.112]].\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of तिक is तैकायनि formed by फिञ् [[4.1.154]]. The <i>Yuvan</i> of तैकायनि is तैकायनीय formed by the affix छ [[4.1.149]]. The word denoting the pupils of तैकायनीय will be formed by adding छ [[4.2.114]] not to this word, but to तैकायनि ॥ Thus तैकायनीयाः ॥\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of कपिञ्जलाद is कपिञ्जलादिः [[4.1.95]]. The <i>Yuvan</i> derivative of the latter will be कापिञ्जलाद्य; (IV. I. 151). The word denoting pupils of the कापिञ्जलाद्य will be कापिञ्जलादाः [[4.2.112]].\n\nSimilarly Patronymic from ग्लुचुक is ग्लुचुकायनिः [[4.1.160]], the <i>Yuvan</i> of the latter is ग्लौचुकायनः [[4.1.83]]; the word denoting the pupils of the latter is ग्लौचुकायनाः by (IV. 2. 112 formed from ग्लुचुकायनि) ॥ Why do we say \"an affix beginning with a vowel\"?

    "41091": "By the last <i>sutra</i>, all <i>Yuvan</i> affixes were told to be elided. The present <i>sutra</i> declares an option in the case of the <i>Yuvan</i> affixes फक् and फिञ्.

Thus from यस्क, the Patronymic is यास्क [[4.1.112]]. The <i>Yuvan</i> of the latter is यास्कायनि [[4.1.146]]. The pupils of <i>Yaskayani</i> will be called यास्कीया or यास्कायनीयाः ॥",

The affixes herein taught have the force of denoting descendant, when they are added to the word in construction which is in the genitive case. The translation given by Dr. Ballantyne of this aphorism is :- \"Let the affixes already mentioned or to be mentioned come optionally in the sense of the offspring thereof, after what word ending with the sixth case-affix and having completed its junction (with whatever it may require to be compounded with), is in grammatical relation there to\".\nThus we may either use the sentence उपगोरपत्यम्; or by adding आण् [[4.1.83]] to the word उपगु (which has the 6th. case-affix in construction in the above sentence), form औपगवः \"the offspring of <i>Upagu</i>\". आश्वपतः [[4.1.84]] 'the offspring of अश्वपति', दैत्यः [[4.1.85]] 'the offspring of <i>Diti</i>' औत्सः [[4.1.86]] \"the offspring of <i>Utsa</i>\". स्त्रैणः [[4.1.87]] 'the offspring of a woman'. पौस्नः [[4.1.87]] 'the offspring of a man'. \n\nThe Universal <i>sutra</i> तस्येदम् [[4.3.120]] will include this अपत्य also for the word इदम् may be applied to any-thing like अपत्यं, समूहः, विकारः, निवासः &c. Since by that rule [[4.3.120]] अण् &c, may be applied in the sense of <i>apatyam</i> also, what is the necessity of this present <i>sutra</i> ? The present <i>sutra</i> is made in order to debar those affixes like छ, [[4.3.114]] which debar the affix अण् &c in the case of तस्येदम् ॥ How can an अशैषिक affix debar a शैषिक affix? The उत्सर्ग affixes अण् &c are treated like शैषिक for this purpose. Thus these affixes अण् [[4.1.83]]- [[4.1.87]] debar the छ in the <i>Vriddham</i> under certain circumstances.

    "41093": "The word <i>Gotra</i> is defined in <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.152]] and means the offspring beginning with the grandson. There would have arisen the application of a separate affix in denoting the descendant of every one of such persons; the present <i>sutra</i> declares a restriction. Thus the son of गर्गः is गार्गि [[4.1.95]]. The son of गार्गिः (or in other words the grandson of गर्ग) is गार्ग्यः [[4.1.105]]. This is formed by a <i>Gotra</i> affix. Now the son of गार्ग्यः will also be called गार्ग्यः, no new affix will be added. In fact, in denoting the <i>Gotra</i> descendants how low soever, the affix यञ् will be added to the word गर्ग, though there may be several intermediate descendants. Thus the <i>sutra</i> restricts the application of the affix. Or in another view of the matter, it may be said to restrict the base to which the affix is to be added. Thus the son of गार्ग्य will be formed by adding the affix यञ् not to the base गार्ग्य (which would have been the case were [[4.1.92]] strictly applied), but to the base गर्ग ॥ So that one base is to be taken and adhered to throughout, in applying <i>Gotra</i> affixes.",
    "41094": "This is also a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule. Thus the <i>Yuvan</i> of गार्ग्य is गार्ग्यायणः [[4.1.101]].

Observe दाक्षी which is the feminine of दाक्षिः (<i>Gotra</i>) as well as of दाक्षायणः (<i>Yuvan</i>). Similarly प्लाक्षी feminine of प्लाक्षिः and प्लाक्षायणः ॥ In short, <i>Yuvan</i> affixes are not added in the feminine. If it is intended to denote a feminine descendant of the kind <i>Yuvan</i>, the feminine word formed by <i>Gotra</i> affix will denote such a descendant also.\n\nWhat is here prohibited i. e. is the term <i>Gotra</i> superseded by the term <i>Yuvan</i>? If it is a <i>niyama</i> rule, there will be no <i>niyama</i> with regard to the feminine, as the prohibition is contained in the same sentence. Therefore in the feminine, the <i>Yuvan</i> affix will not get the designation of <i>Gotra</i>, because <i>Gotra</i>-name is debarred by <i>Yuvan</i> Name. Therefore the <i>sutra</i> should be divided in two, e. g. गोत्राद् यूनि प्रत्ययो भवति (2) ततोऽस्त्रियाम् ॥ (1) After a <i>Gotra</i> formed word a new affix is added in denoting a <i>Yuvan</i> descendant, (2) but not so in the feminine.

The letter ञ् of this affix causes <i>Vriddhi</i> [[7.2.117]]. Then remains फ् which by <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.2]], is replaced by आयन् ॥ Thus कुञ्ज + च्फञ् = कौञ्ज + आयन् + अ = कौञ्जायन.

Here इञ् is added by [[4.1.95]] in denoting immediate descendant. There is difference in the accent of these words, in the different numbers. Thus in the singular and dual, the accent will be regulated by the latter ञ् of the affix ञ्य which is added in those numbers. But this affix being elided in the plural, the accent there will be regulated by the letter च of च्फञ् ॥ That is to say, in the singular and dual, the <i>udatta</i> will fall on the first syllable [[6.1.197]]; in the plural, it will fall on the last syllable [[6.1.164]].\n\nThe word गोत्रे of this <i>sutra</i> governs the succeeding <i>sutras</i> up to aphorism [[4.1.112]]: so that all the affixes taught in these fifteen <i>sutras</i> denote grandsons or descendants lower than that.\n\n1 कुञ्ज, 2 ब्रध्र, 3 शङ्ख, 4 भस्मन्, 5 गण, 6 लोमन्, 7 शत, 8 शाक, 9 शुण्डा, 10 शुभ, 11 विपाश्, 12 स्कन्द, 13 स्कम्भ, 14 शकट, 15 शुम्भा, 16 शिव, 17 शुभंयि ॥",

    "41100": "The words हरित &c, form a subdivision of बिद class, which class by [[4.1.104]] takes the affix अञ् in forming <i>Gotra</i> words.

Thus हारित + फक् = हारितायनः \"the son of <i>Harita</i> or the great-grandson of <i>Harita</i>\". In fact, the force of the affix फक् of this <i>Sutra</i> is that of a <i>Yuvan</i> affix, though it is taught in the chapter of <i>Gotra</i> affixes; because according to the general rule [[4.1.98]] one <i>Gotra</i> affix can be only added to a word, and the word हारित that being already formed by a <i>Gotra</i> affix अञ् will not take again another <i>Gotra</i> affix फक् ॥ Therefore, फक् as is here a <i>Yuvan</i>-affix.",
    "41101": "The फक् of this <i>sutra</i> has, like that of the preceding <i>sutra</i>, the force of a <i>Yuvan</i> affix, since it is to be added to words formed by the <i>Gotra</i> affixes यञ् and इञ् ॥ Thus गर्ग + यञ् (IV. I. 105) = गार्ग्यः ॥ गार्ग्य + फक् = गार्ग्यायणः ॥ दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षिः; दाक्षि + फक् = दाक्षायणः ॥ It is not every word which ends in यञ् or इञ् which takes the <i>Yuvan</i> affix फक्; but only that word where the affix यञ् or इञ् has the force of a <i>Gotra</i> affix. Thus the affix यञ् is added by [[4.3.10]] to denote proximity to a sea. As द्वीप + यञ् = द्वैप्यः ॥ This word will not take the affix फक् ॥ Similarly by [[4.2.80]] the affix इञ् is added to the words सुतंगम &c, the force of the affix being चातुरर्थिक ॥ Thus सौतंगमिः.

How is then अश्वत्थामा the son of <i>Drona</i>, called द्रौणायनः and not द्रौणिः in the phrase \"अश्वत्थामा द्रौणायनः\"? The द्रोण here does not refer to the <i>Drona</i> of the <i>Mahabharat</i>, but to some ancient founder of a clan of that name, and his descendants were called द्रौणायनाः ॥ In modern times, by an easy error, <i>Asvatthama</i> was called <i>Draunayana</i>, owing to the similarity of sounds.",
    "41104": "This <i>Sutra</i> consists of four words: अनृषि \"non-<i>Rishi</i> or not being the name of a sage\"; आनन्तर्ये \"in expressing an immediate descendant.\" बिदादिभ्य \"after <i>Bidadi</i> words\" अञ् \"the affix अञ्.\" Thus of the words falling in <i>Bidadi</i> class, the words like पुत्र 'son,' दुहित्र 'daughter,' ननान्दृ 'sister-in-law' are common nouns and not names of <i>Rishis</i>. When the affix अञ् is added to these words, it has the force of denoting immediate descendant. Thus पुत्र + अञ् = पौत्रः 'grand-son.' दुहितृ + अञ् = दौहित्रः 'daughter's son.' But when added to other words which express the names of <i>Rishis</i>, the affix अञ् makes the <i>Gotra</i> descendants. Thus बिद + अञ् = बैदः 'the grandson or a descendant lower than that of <i>Bida</i>.'\n\nHow in a context relating to <i>Gotra</i> affixes, we come to this two fold meaning of this <i>sutra</i>? To this we reply, that the phrase अनृष्यानन्तर्ये should be thus construed. The word '<i>anrishi</i>' is in the ablative case, the case affix being elided. The word आनन्तर्य is the same as अनन्तर the affix ष्यङ् being added without change of significance. Therefore the words like पौत्र &c. denote the immediate (<i>anantara</i>) descendant of पुत्र &c, and do not denote a remote descendant (<i>gotra</i>), nor a descendant in general. Therefore, the above phrase means :- 'after a <i>Bidadi</i> word which is not the name of a <i>Rishi</i>, the affix '<i>an</i>' is added in denoting an immediate descendant.'\n\nQ. Another way of explaining the phrase is this, the word '<i>anantarya</i>' is equal to'<i>nairantarya</i>' = 'uninterrupted succession.' Therefore, where there is an uninterrupted succession of <i>Rishis</i> between the first name and the person to be designated by a Patronymic, there the affix '<i>an</i>' will not be added. Thus the word कश्यप, belongs to the <i>Bidadi</i> class. '<i>Indrabhu</i>' a seventh descendant of <i>Kasyapa</i>, will not be denoted by काश्यप formed with अञ्, because between इन्द्रभू and कश्यप, there is an unbroken series of <i>Rishis</i>, but by अण् of [[4.1.114]]. Therefore the following phrase will be valid इन्द्रभूः सप्तमः काश्यपानाम् ॥ For अञ् is elided in the plural by [[2.4.64]], but काश्यपानाम् is plural of  काश्यप formed with the general patronymic अण् of [[4.1.114]] and hence not elided.\n\nA. This explanation is not to be preferred, merely in order to explain the word काश्यपानाम् in इन्द्रभूः सप्तमः काश्यपानाम् ॥ The general Patronymic ऋषि affix अण् of [[4.1.114]] is not debarred by this अञ् ॥ Therefore काश्यप with अञ् will denote इन्द्रभूः, which may also be denoted by काश्यप formed with अण् ॥ For had the above explanation been correct, then विश्वामित्र the grandson of <i>Kusika</i> could never be called कौशिकः (formed with अञ्), for both <i>Gadhi</i> the father of <i>Visvamitra</i>, and <i>Kusika</i> the grand-father were <i>Rishis</i>.\n\nIn denoting an immediate descendant or a descendant in general, the <i>Rishi</i> words बिद &c, will take other appropriate affixes. Thus बिद forms बैदि 'a descendant of <i>Bida</i>' by [[4.1.96]] इञ् and not by ऋष्यण् of [[4.1.114]], because बिद is supposed to belong to the <i>Akrtigana</i> of <i>Bahvadi</i>.\n\n1 बिद, 2 उर्व, 3 कश्यप, 4 कुशिक, 5 भरद्वाज, 6 उपमन्यु, 7 किलात, 8 कन्दर्प (किंदर्भ) 9 विश्वानर, 10 ऋषिषेण (ऋष्टिशेण) 11 ऋतभाग, 12 हर्यश्व, 13 प्रियक, 14 आपस्तम्ब, 15 कूचवार, 16 शरद्वत्, 17 शुनक (शुनक्), 18 धेनु, 19 गोपवन, 20 शिग्रु, 21 बिन्दु, 22 भोगक, 23 भाजन, 24 शमिक, 25 अश्वावतान, 26 श्यामाक, 27 श्यानक, 28 दयावलि, 29 श्यापर्ण, 30 हरित, 31 किंदास, 32 बह्यस्क, 33 अर्कजूष (अर्कलूक) 34 बध्योग, 35 विष्णु, 36 बुद्ध, 37 प्रतिबोध, 38 रचित, 39 रथीतर (रथन्तर) 40 गविष्ठिर, 41 निषाद, 42 शबर, 43 अलस, 44 मठर, 45 मृडाकु, 46 सृपाकु, 47 मृदु, 48 पुनर्भू, 49 पूत्र, 50 दुहितृ, 51 ननान्दृ, 52 परस्त्री परशुं च । 53 किलालप, 54 सम्बक्, 55 श्यायक ॥\n\nThe word परस्त्री in the above list is replaced by परशु when taking the affix अञ् ॥ Thus परस्त्रिया अपत्यं = पारशवः (the son of a <i>Brahmana</i> begotten on a <i>Sudra</i> woman, who though married to the <i>Brahmana</i> is परस्त्री 'a strange woman' owing to the great difference of race).\n\nThe word परस्त्री occurs in अनुशतिकादि [[7.3.20]] and कल्याण्यादि [[4.1.126]] classes also. Therefore when the sense is 'a son begotten on another's wife' who is also called परस्त्री, the form will be पारस्त्रैणेयः, with double <i>vriddhi</i> of both members by [[7.3.20]]: which does not take place in the case of पारशवः ॥",

If so, then why the immediate descendant of जमदग्नि is called जामदग्न्यः which is a Name of <i>Parasuram</i> the son of <i>Jamadagni</i>, or why <i>Vyasa</i> the son of <i>Parasara</i> is called पाराशर्यः ? These are exceptions formed by गोत्र रुपाध्यारोपः i.e. by superimposing of <i>Gotra</i>-form on these. Their proper <i>apatya</i> forms are by ऋष्यण् [[4.1.114]] i. e. जामदग्नः and पाराशरः ॥",
    "41106": "Thus माधव्यः = ब्राह्मणः '<i>Brahmana</i>.' Otherwise माधवः \"son of <i>Madhu</i>.\" बाभ्रव्यः = कौशिकः Otherwise बाभ्रवः ॥\n\nThe word बभ्रु belongs to the <i>Gargadi</i> class, so it would have taken <i>yan</i> by the last <i>sutra</i> also. The present <i>sutra</i> declares a restriction, viz. बभ्रु takes यञ् only then when कौशिक is denoted. Its being read in the <i>Gargadi</i> class serves another purpose : as it belongs to the sub-class लोहितादि, the rule [[4.1.18]] becomes applicable to it; so that its feminine is formed by ष्फ. Thus बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥ In fact, it would have been better, if in the body of the <i>Ganapatha</i>, instead of writing बभ्रु alone, there was बभ्रु कौशिके ॥ It would have saved the repetition of it in the present <i>sutra</i>.",
    "41107": "Thus कपि + यञ् = काप्यः 'the grand-son or a still lower descendant of '<i>Kapi</i>' of the family of <i>Angiras</i>.' So also बौध्यः ॥\n\nWhy do we say of the family of <i>Angiras</i> ? Observe कापेयः (IV. I. 122) \"the <i>gotra</i>-descendant of <i>Kapi</i>\" so also बौधिः formed by इञ् because it is a Non-<i>Rishi</i> word or because it belongs to <i>Bahvadi</i> [[4.1.96]] class.\n\nThe word कपि occurs in <i>Gargadi</i> class. The present <i>sutra</i> declares a restriction i. e. the '<i>yan</i>' is to be applied only when <i>Angirasa</i> descendant is meant. It is included in the <i>Gargadi</i> class also for the purpose of applying (IV. I. 18). Thus काप्यायनी \"grand-daughter or a still lower descendant of <i>Kapi</i>.\"",
    "41108": "Thus वातण्ड्यः = आंगिरसः, otherwise वातण्डः ॥\n\nThe word वतण्ड occurs both in the <i>Gargadi</i> class [[4.1.105]] and in the <i>Sivadi</i> class [[4.1.112]]. It would have taken both affixes अञ् and अण्. The present <i>sutra</i> declares that when it means an <i>Angirasa</i>, then वतण्ड will not take अण् of the शिवादि class : and when it does not mean <i>Angirasa</i>, then it takes both these affixes e. g. वातंड्यः and वातंडः any descendant of <i>Vatanda</i>.",
    "41109": "Thus from वतण्डः we get वातण्ड्य in the masculine. In the feminine the यञ् is elided by <i>luk</i>, and we have वातण्ड्य + ङीन् [[4.1.73]] = वतण्डी \"a female descendant of <i>Vatanda</i> of the clan <i>Angirasa</i>.\" Why do we say \"of <i>Angirasa</i>?\" Observe वातंड्यायनी formed with '<i>shpha</i>' under <i>lohitadi</i> rule [[5.1.18]]. When वतण्ड takes अण् under <i>Sivadi</i> class, its feminine is वातण्डी ॥ Though the word is formed with अण् yet in the feminine, there is not ष्यङ् substitution [[4.1.78]], because <i>Vatanda</i> is a <i>Rishi</i>-Name.",
    "41110": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>angirasa</i> does not extend to this aphorism. Thus अश्व + फञ् = अश्व + आयन [[7.1.2]] = आश्वायनः [[7.2.117]] 'the grandson or a still lower descendant of <i>Asva</i>'. Similarly आश्मायनः There are some words in this class which already have taken a patronymic affix, e.g, आत्रेय, वैल्य, and आनडुह्य ॥ After these words the affix फञ् of course has the force of a <i>Yuvan</i> affix. The word आत्रेय is formed by त्रि + ढक् [[4.1.122]], वैल्य = विलि (a <i>Rajarshi</i>) + ञ्यङ् [[4.1.171]], and आनडुह्य = अमडुह + यञ् [[4.1.105]]. The word शय takes <i>phan</i> only when it denotes an <i>Atreya</i>, as शायायनः, otherwise शायिः with इञ् or शायः with अण् ॥ The word जात takes '<i>phan</i>' only when the offspring of a male is to be denoted, as जातस्यापत्यं = जातायनः but जाताया अपत्यं = जातेयः with ढक् ॥ The word आत्रेय takes '<i>phan</i>' when denoting a <i>Bharadvaja</i>, as आत्रेयायनः, otherwise it will take the affix इञ्, which will be elided by [[2.4.28]], leaving the form आत्रेयः ॥\n\nThe words भरद्वाज आत्रेये of the above list mean that when a person born in <i>Atri</i> <i>Gotra</i> is adopted by a person belonging to <i>Bharadvaja</i> <i>Gotra</i>, then the affix is to be added, he of course is an <i>Atreya</i> but gets a new <i>Gotra</i> of <i>Bharadvaja</i>.

    "41113": "The word <i>Vriddham</i> in the <i>sutra</i>, does not mean the technical Patronymic of that name as defined in other Grammars and used in <i>Sutras</i> like [[4.1.166]], but means the <i>Vriddham</i> as defined in this Grammar i. e. a word whose first syllable is a <i>Vriddhi</i> letter [[1.1.73]]. The word अवृद्धाभ्यः shows the orthography of the word to which the affix is to be added. The word नदीमानुषीभ्यः declares the meaning of that word and both attributes refer to one and the same base, i.e. orthographically the base should have a <i>Vriddhi</i> letter in the first syllable, and etymologically it should denote a man or a river. The word तन्नामिकाभ्यः applies both to the base and the affix.\n\nThus यमुना--यामुनः 'a son of the <i>Yamuna</i>.' ऐरावत 'son of the <i>Iravati</i>'. वैतस्तः 'son of the <i>Vitasta</i>.' नार्मदः 'son of the <i>Narmadda</i>.'

The present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to that.",
    "41114": "This debars the affix इञ् ॥ The <i>Rishis</i> are like <i>Vasishtha</i>, <i>Visvamitra</i> &c.

I. 122) enjoins ढक्; thus there being a conflict, we apply the maxim of interpretation contained in (1. 4. 2). So that the Patronymic or अत्रि will be formed not by अण् but by ढक् ॥ Thus आत्रेयः ॥ Similarly उग्रसेन a person of <i>Andhaka</i> family, forms its patronymic औग्रसेन्यः [[4.1.152]] by ण्य; and not by अण्, so also वैष्वकसेन्य 'son of <i>Vaishvaksena</i>' a person of <i>Vrishni</i>, family; so also भैमसेन्यः 'son of <i>Bhimasena</i>' a person of <i>Kuru</i> family.\n\nNote.- The words or <i>sabdas</i> are eternal; how is it that rules applying to them should be made dependant upon their occurring in particular families or not, when families themselves are non-eternal? In other word, how a rule affecting a permanent object is conditioned by an impermanent adjunct? To this, some reply that <i>Panini</i> has by mere coincidence (and not as cause and effect) classified certain definite number of words as belonging to certain families, and then the rule made applicable to them. Moreover a permanent object is sometimes designated by an impermanent object : as the permanent time is designated by the name of <i>Saka</i>. Others say that the families of <i>Andhaka</i> &c., are also permanent, and the words '<i>Nakula</i>' '<i>Sahadeva</i>' &c., found therein are, of course, permanent.",
    "41115": "Thus from द्विमातृ we have द्वैमातुरः \"son of two mothers i.e. son of one and adopted by another.\" द्विमातृ + अण् = द्वैमात् + उ + अ = द्वैमात् + उ + र् + अ (I. I. 51.) Similarly षाण्मातुरः, सांमातुरः, and भाद्रमातुरः ॥\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is made in order to teach the substitution of short उ for ऋ of मातृ; for the word मातृ would have taken the affix अण् by the general rule [[4.1.83]]. The <i>sutra</i> contains the word पूर्वायाः in the feminine gender, showing by implication that the rule applies where the word मातृ denotes female. Thus संमिमीते = संमातृ 'he who measures together'. Its patronymic will be सांमात्रः 'son of a fellow-measurer'; because here the word मातृ does not mean 'mother', but a 'measure'. Nor the word धान्यमातृ 'barley measurer' will be affected by this rule. Why do we say \"when preceded by a Numeral &c.\" Observe सौमात्रः 'son of <i>Sumatri</i>'.

So also सौपर्णेयः \"Son of <i>Vinata</i> or <i>Suparni</i>\". But ऐडविडः and दारदः formed by अण् meaning sons of इडविड and दरद, for though these words are feminine. they do not end in feminine affixes.\n\nVart:- The affix ढक् comes after वडवा when meaning वृष ॥ Thus वाडवेयः = वृषः \"bull.\" Here '<i>dhak</i>' has not the patronymic force.

    "41121": "Thus दत्ताया अपत्यं = दात्तेयः 'son of <i>Datta</i>', गौपेयः \"son of <i>Gopi</i>\". This debars the अण् of [[4.1.113]].\n\nWhy do we say 'having two vowels ?' Observe यामुनः 'son of यमुना', which is a trisyllabic word, and not dissyllabic.",
    "41122": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>stri</i>' does not extend to this aphorism.

Thus आत्रेयः 'the son of <i>Atri</i>'. नैधेयः 'the son of निधिः' ।\n\nWhy do we say \"after a word ending in short इ\"?

The word कौरव्य formed by the ण्य of [[4.1.172]], loses its affix in the plural, because ण्य of [[4.1.172]] is a <i>Tadraja</i> affix (see (II 4. 62): but the word कौरव्य formed by the present <i>sutra</i> retains its affix in the plural.

Therefore, by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.171]] they having a <i>Vriddhi</i> in the first syllable, would have taken the affix 'nyan', the present <i>sutra</i> enjoins 'an' instead.

There have been taught five <i>Tadraja</i> affixes, namely '<i>an</i> अ)', '<i>an</i> (अ)', 'nyan (य)', 'nya (य)' and 'in (इ)'.

But the very fact of this <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.176]] indicates by ज्ञापक, that the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> does not apply here.

The affix being elided by '<i>lup</i>', why should not [[1.2.51]] apply here? We should say श्रवणा रात्रिः and not श्चवण रात्रिः The reason is that श्रवणा is an irregularly formed word, as <i>Panini</i> himself uses it in <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.23]].

Similarly कालेयम् means 'the <i>Sama</i>-<i>Veda</i> seen by <i>Kali</i>, he who stays in <i>Kali</i>, what has come from <i>Kali</i> &c.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् is optionally treated as if it had an indicatory ड् when the sense is that of <i>Sama</i>-<i>Veda</i> seen. Thus उशनसा दृष्टं साम = औशनसम् or औशनम् (the force of डित् being to elide the टि portion; [[6.4.143]]).\n\nVart:- The affix अण् in the sense of 'born', is optionally treated as डित्, provided that it be that अण् which being debarred by [[4.3.11]], is re-ordained by [[4.3.16]].

    "42021": "The word स means 'that'. It is in the nominative case, therefore by [[4.1.82]] it means that \"after a word in the first case in construction\". अस्मिन् 'in it' i.e. in the sense of a seventh case. पौर्णमासीति \"if the word in the first case in construction is the name of a full-moon night\". The word इति after पौर्णमासी is used for the sake of clearness. The word संज्ञायाम् does not occur in the original <i>sutras</i> of <i>Panini</i>; but is added by a <i>Vartika</i>; and means 'if the word so formed is an appellative', i. e. if it is the name of a month, a half-month and a year. The whole <i>sutra</i> therefore literally translated means \"the affix अण् already ordained (IV.

The word संज्ञायाम् added to the <i>sutra</i> by the <i>Vartika</i> is a redundancy.\n\nThe word पौर्णमासी is formed by adding अण् to पूर्णमास ॥ Or it may be evolved in this way:-पुर्णो माः = पूर्णमाः, पूर्णमास इयम् पौर्णमासी ॥ The word माः means \"moon\".",
    "42022": "The words सास्मिन्पौर्णमासीति of the last <i>sutra</i> govern this also. This debars अण् ॥ Thus आग्रहायणिको मासः 'the month called <i>Agrahayanika</i>' i.e. in which the moon is full in the asterism of <i>Agrahayana</i>. Similarly आश्वत्थिकः ॥",

Though the word स was understood in this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.21]], its repetition is for the sake of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of संज्ञा does not extend to it.

    "42034": "Thus by [[4.3.11]] (read with [[4.3.53]]), the affix ठञ् comes after the words expressive of time, in the sense of 'who stays there'. The same affix will also come in the sense of साऽस्यदेवता ॥ Thus मासे भवं = मासिकम् (मास + ठञ् = मास = इक [[7.3.50]]); अर्द्धमासिकम्, सांवत्सरिकम्, वासन्तम् [[4.3.16]], प्रावृषेण्यम् [[4.3.17]] : meaning 'monthly', 'half monthly', 'annual', 'vernal', and 'rainy'. The words will also mean 'an oblation sacred to a month i.e' as मासो देवताऽस्य मासिकम् ॥ &c.",
    "42035": "Thus महाराजो देवताऽस्य = महाराजिकम्, प्रौष्ठपदिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- After the words नवयज्ञ &c the affix ठञ् comes in the sense of 'that exists in it'. As नवयज्ञोऽस्मिन् वर्तते = नावयज्ञिकः कालः ॥ So also पाकयज्ञिकः &c.\n\nVart:- After the word पूर्णमास, the affix अण् comes in the same sense.

    "42036": "We can infer from these forms, what were the affixes, having what indicatory letters, employed in what sense and coming after what cases of the base. Thus if any rules need be formed, we may ennunciate the following rules:- पितृमातृभ्यां भ्रातरि व्यड् डुलचौ 'the affixes व्यत् and डुलच् come respectively after the words <i>pitri</i> and <i>matri</i> in the sense of his brother'. Similarly the second rule will be ताभ्यां पितरि डामहच्, मातरिषच्च 'and the affix <i>damahach</i> comes, in the sense of their father; and their feminine is formed as if the affix had an indicatory ष् ॥ Thus पितृव्यः, मातुलः, पितामहः (f. पितामही), मातामह (f. मातामही) ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes सोढ, दूस, and मरीसच् come after the word अवि, in the sense of 'milk'. As अवेर्दुग्धम् = अविसोढम् or अविदूसम् or अविमरीसम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes पिञ्ज and पेज come after the word तिल, in the sense of fruitless. As निष्फलस्तिलः = तिलपिपिञ्जः and तिलपेजः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix पिञ्ज् is treated like डित् in the <i>Chhandas</i>. As तिल्पिञ्जः ॥",
    "42037": "The affix अण् [[4.7.83]] already taught, is added to a word in the 6th case in construction, in the sense of collection. What is the example of this? In order to apply the affix अण्, we must apply it to those words only, to which the special rules hereinafter taught do not apply. In other words, the affix अण् is added in the sense of collection thereof, to a word which denotes a conscious being, which has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable, which does not end with a <i>Gotra</i>-affix, and which is not a word specifically mentioned in the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. For, a word expressing a non-conscious being, will take the affix ठक् by [[4.2.47]], a word having <i>anudatta</i> on the first syllable will have the affix अञ् [[4.3.44]], a <i>Gotra</i> word will take वुञ् [[4.2.39]] and especial words like केदार &c take यञ् &c. Making all these exclusions, the example we is:- काकानां समूहः = काकम् 'a collection of crows' बाकम् ॥ The phrase तस्य समूहः of this aphorism governs all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.51]] inclusive.\n\nVart:- The affix ग्रामच् comes after the words गुण् &c. As गुणग्रामः 'a collection of qualities', करणग्रामः &c. The following is some of such words:- गुण, करण, तत्व, शब्द, इन्द्रिय, &c. It is an <i>akritigana</i>.",
    "42038": "The repetition of the word अण् in this <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was here, is for the sake of removing the operation of any obstructing rule.\n\nThus भिक्षाणां समूहः = भैक्षम् 'what is collected in the shape of alms'. So also गर्भिणी + अण् = गर्भिण् + अण् (the masculine form of a <i>Bha</i> is substituted, when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix follows without an indicatory ढ, भस्याढे तद्धिते) = गर्भिणः [[6.4.164]], In the case of युवति, the word however is not changed to its masculine form.

    "42041": "Thus कावचिकम् [[6.4.144]]; and कैदारिकम्. We read the <i>anuvritti</i> of केदार in this <i>Sutra</i>, by virtue of the word च",
    "42042": "The indicatory न् of यन् makes the word take <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable (VI. I. 197). Thus ब्राह्मण्यम्, माणव्यम्, वाडव्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- Also after the word पृष्ठ e.g. पृष्ठ्यः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ख is added to अहन्, in the sense of a 'sacrifice'. e.g. अहीनः 'a collection of days of sacrifice'. Otherwise the form is आह्नः by अञ् see [[4.2.45]].\n\nVart:-The affix णस् comes after पर्शु, e.g. पार्श्वम् 'a collection of axes'. The final उ of पर्शु is not changed by <i>guna</i> into ओ before the affix, because the word पर्शु is treated as a <i>pada</i>-word (1. 4. 16) and not a <i>Bha</i>-word.\n\nVart:- The affix ऊल is added to वात e.g. वातूलः 'a collection of winds or a mad-man'.",
    "42043": "Thus ग्रामता 'a collection of villages'. The words ending in तल् are all feminine. So also जनता 'a collection of persons', बन्धुता 'a collection of relatives', and सहायता 'a collection of allies'.\n\nVart:- The affix '<i>tal</i>' comes after गज also e.g. गजता 'a collection of elephants'.",
    "42044": "Thus कपोतानां समूहः = कापोतम्, मायूरम्, तैत्तिरम् ॥",

It is a <i>Dvandva</i> compound of two words क्षुद्रक and मालव, denoting tribes of <i>Kshatriyas</i>. The <i>Tadraja</i> affix अञ् (IV. I. 168) is elided after the first, and ञ्यङ् [[4.1.171]] after the second word which is a <i>Vriddham</i>. When these two words form a compound, the acute falls on the final (VI. I. 223), the initial of this compound is therefore, <i>anudatta</i>: and therefore by the last <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.44]], this word would have taken अञ्; where is the necessity of its being included in this list? It is to exclude the वुञ् of [[4.2.39]] which comes after a <i>Gotra</i> word. But will not the subsequent अञ् [[4.2.44]] debar the preceding वुञ् [[4.2.39]] by the rule of <i>paratva</i>? Moreover, a collection or aggregate of two <i>Gotra</i> words will not be called <i>Gotra</i>, as an aggregate of countries is not called a 'country' for the application of <i>janapada</i> rule, as काशिकोसलीयाः does not take वुञ् and there will not apply <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> to the compound word क्षुद्रकमालव, which ends in a <i>gotra</i> word?. To this we reply, that the fact of the inclusion of this word in the list, is an indication of the existence of these two rules : (1) that वुञ् affix supersedes a subsequent affix in cases of conflict. Thus औपगव and कापटव are <i>anudattadi</i> words because formed by अण् (III. I. 2), and require therefore अञ् by [[4.2.44]], but वुञ् supersedes it, and we have औपगवकम् and कापटवकम् ॥ The second rule is: (2) that in सामूहिक affixes there is <i>tadantavidhi</i> in spite of the prohibition contained in <i>vartika</i> under [[1.1.72]]. As वानहस्तिकं, गौधेनुकम् ॥ The complete sentence in the <i>Ganapatha</i> is क्षुद्रकमालवात् सेनासंज्ञायाम्, the first portion denotes the existence of the above two rules, the second portion सेना &c restricts the application of the rule. The affix is added when it is the name of a सेना 'army' and not otherwise. As क्षौद्रकमालवी सेना, otherwise क्षौद्रकमालवकं ॥ The existence of above corollaries is proved by the <i>sutra</i> of the Grammarian <i>Apisali</i> also धेनुरनञि ठकमुत्पादयति 'the affix ठक् comes after धेनु in denoting collection thereof, when not preceded by the negative particle नञ्', therefore, when preceded by any other word, the affix will apply.\n\n1 खण्डिक (खण्डिका K.), 2 वडवा, 3 क्षुद्रकमालवात्सेनासंज्ञायाम् (a <i>Vartika</i> to 4, 2, 45), 4 भिक्षुक, 5 शुक, 6 उलूक, 7 श्वन्, 8 अहन्, 9 युगवरत्र, (वरत्रा v. 1.; युग, वरत्रा K.), 10 हलबन्ध (बग्धा).",
    "42046": "The Vedic Schools or <i>Charanas</i> are like कठ, कलाप &c. The affixes denoting the rule of the School are those taught in <i>Sutra</i> [[4.3.126]] &c. The word धर्म does not occur in the <i>Sutra</i> [[4.3.126]], or any where else, but it occurs in the following <i>ishti</i> under that <i>Sutra</i>:-चरणद्धर्माम्नाययोः ॥ Thus कठानां धर्म = काठकम्, so also कठानां समूहः = काठकम् ॥ Similarly कालापकम्, छान्दोग्यम्, औक्धिक्यम् and आथर्वणम् ॥",
    "42047": "This debars अण् and अञ् ॥ The अपूपानां समूहः = आपूपिकम् ॥ The affix ठक् is replaced by इक् [[7.3.50]] or क [[7.3.50]]. Thus हास्तिकम्, धेनुकम्, शाष्कुलिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- Not so, if the word धेनु is preceded by the negative particle नञ् ॥ As आधेनवम् (See IV. 2. 45).",

    "42052": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of समूहः [[4.2.37]] does not extend further : but the <i>anuvritti</i> of तस्य [[4.2.37]] is to be read into it. The whole <i>sutra</i> thus becomes तस्य विषयो देशे  'his sphere-in denoting a country'. The word विषय 'sphere, topic' has many significations. Sometime it means an estate, as विषयो लब्धः, 'a village has been acquired'. Some time it means an object of perception, as चक्षु र्विषयो रूपं 'color is the object of sight' &c. Therefore the word देश has been used in the <i>Sutra</i>, in order to fix the particular meaning of the word विषय ॥\n\nThus शिबीनां विषयो देशः = शैवः 'The country within the sphere of the <i>Sibi</i>'.

The word इति is added for the sake of precision. छन्दसः 'after the name of a metre'. This points out the base. प्रगाथेषु 'in the sense of <i>Pragatha</i>'. This qualifies the meaning of the affix. To put it in other words, the <i>sutra</i> means, that the affix अण् is added to the name of a metre, when that metre is the beginning of a <i>Pragatha</i>, and the whole word so formed means a <i>Pragatha</i> beginning with that metre. Thus पंक्ति is the name of a metre, adding अण् to it we get पांक्तः which means \"a <i>Pragatha</i> beginning with the metre <i>Pankti</i>\". Similarly आनुष्टुभः, जागतः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"beginning\"? If the metre is in the middle or end of a '<i>Pragatha</i>' the affix will not be employed. Why do we say 'after the name of a metre'?

The affix will not be added, if the metre is the beginning of an <i>Anuvaka</i> &c and not of a <i>Pragatha</i>. <i>Pragatha</i> is the name of a particular kind of <i>Mantra</i> or Hymn यत्र द्वे ऋचौ प्रगथनेन तिस्रः क्रियन्ते, स प्रगायनात् पकर्षगानात् वा प्रगाथ इत्युच्यते ॥\n\nVarti:- The affix अण् is added to the name of a metre in a self-descriptive sense without changing the meaning of it; and the word so formed is in the neuter gender.

    "42056": "The phrase सोऽस्य is understood here; showing that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the first case: and must be the name of the \"object\" प्रयोजनः, or of the \"warrior\" योद्धृ ॥ The whole word so formed must denote a 'battle'. Therefore, the word संग्राम gives the meaning of the affix.\n\nThis भद्रा प्रयोजनमस्य संग्रामस्य = भाद्रः \"A battle fought for <i>Bhadra</i>\".

Similarly अहिमाला योद्धारोऽस्य संग्रामस्य = आहिमालः 'battle led by <i>Ahimala</i> warriors' So also स्यान्दनाश्वः, भारतः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"in the sense of a battle?\" Observe सुभद्रा प्रयोजनमस्य दानस्य '<i>Subhadra</i> is the object of this gift'.

The meaning of the words of the aphorism is:- घञः \"after a word ending in the affix घञ्\"; सा 'that', अस्यां 'in it', the feminine gender shows that the word is also feminine. क्रिया \"action\"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. To put it in other words, the <i>sutra</i> means \"After a word ending in घञ्, expressing an action, being in the Ist case in construction, the affix ञ is added in the sense of a 7th case-affix, the resultant word being in the feminine gender\".\n\nThus श्येनपातोऽस्यां वर्तते - श्यैनंपाता, so also तैलंपाता ॥ The nasal is added by [[6.3.71]].

But when the affix is elided, the feminine is formed by टाप्, the accent is on the middle, owing to the छ affix. (<i>Phit</i> <i>Su</i> II. 19).",
    "42065": "Thus अष्टकं is the title of <i>Panini</i> <i>sutra</i>. Those who study अष्टकं and will be called also अष्टकः, as अष्टकाः पाणिनीयाः 'those who study, the <i>Ashtaka</i>'. So also दशका वैयाघ्रपदीयाः, त्रिकाः काशकृत्स्नाः ॥\n\nVart:- The elision takes place only where the title is formed by a numeral: as in the examples above given. Thus महावार्तिकं सूत्रमधीते = महावार्तिकः, so also कालापकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"having क् for its penultimate\"? Observe चतुष्टयमधीते = चातुष्टयः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> applies, of course, to those words which are not formed by affixes denoting प्रोक्त or the Announcer.",
    "42066": "The word प्रोक्त is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. The force of the affixes denoting announcer [[4.3.101]], when used after a word denoting a Vedic Text or a <i>Brahmana</i>, is that of expressing \"one who studies\" or \"one who knows\". तद्विषयाणि means \"this relation\", i.e. the subject treated of in this section, namely, the relation of अध्येतृ or वेदितृ ॥ In other words, the affixes, which ordinarily denote 'announcer', have the force of \"one who studies or one who knows\" when added to <i>Veda</i>-Text or <i>Brahmanas</i>. That is, a प्रोक्त affix should not be added to a <i>Veda</i> or a <i>Brahmana</i>, except when an अध्येतृ or वेदितृ affix follows it, and as such latter affixes are always elided by [[4.2.94]], it follows that a प्रोक्त affix when added to a <i>Veda</i> or a <i>Brahmana</i>, means \"he who studies or knows the <i>Veda</i> anounced by\". In fact there is no affix which can denote merely the announcer of a <i>Veda</i>, perhaps because the Vedas are eternal and no one can be its announcer only, but must be one who has studied it and known it, in order to qualify him to promulgate it.\n\nThus from the word कठ, the name of a <i>Veda</i>-Text, we get कठाः meaning 'those who study or know <i>Katha</i> Veda'. The word is thus formed. To the word कठ we add the affix णिनि denoting announcer, by [[4.3.104]] : then we elide it by [[4.3.107]], leaving the bare word कट, then we add अण्, which again we elide by [[4.2.64]]. कठ + णिनि = कट + o [[4.3.107]]; कठ + अण् = कठ [[4.2.64]] Plural कठाः \"those who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Katha</i>\".\n\nOther examples to illustrate this <i>sutra</i> are: मौदाः [[4.3.101]] 'who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Muda</i>'. पैप्पलादः, आर्चाभिनः [[4.3.104]] वाजसनेयिनः [[4.3.106]] \"who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Pippalada</i>, <i>Richava</i>, or <i>Vajasaneya</i>\". Similarly with words denoting a <i>Brahmana</i>-Text. Thus : ताण्डिनः [[4.3.104]], भाल्लविनः [[4.3.105]], शाट्यायनिनः [[4.3.105]] ऐतरेयिणः [[4.3.105]] \"who study the <i>Brahmanas</i> announced by <i>Tandya</i>, <i>Bhallava</i>, <i>Satyayana</i>, or <i>Aitareya</i>\". \n\nWhy is the word <i>Brahmana</i> which is also <i>Chhandas</i>, used separately in this <i>sutra</i>? In order to include only a certain limited number of <i>Brahmana</i> Texts to the benefits of this rule, and not all. Thus it will not apply to the <i>Brahmana</i> announced by <i>Yajnyavalkya</i>. Thus याज्ञवल्क्येन प्रोक्तानि ब्राह्मणानि = याज्ञवल्क्यानि ॥ Similarly सौलभानि ॥ These <i>Brahmanas</i> being of recent origin, the presumption of eternity does not apply to them, See [[4.3.105]].\n\nThe word च meaning \"and\" is employed in the <i>sutra</i>. It has the force of applying this rule to some other cases not specially mentioned in the <i>sutra</i>. Thus it will apply to some <i>Kalpa</i> Texts and <i>Sutra</i> Texts also. Thus काश्यपिनः, कौशिकिनः \"who study or know the <i>Kalpa</i> texts announced by <i>Kasyapa</i> or <i>Kusika</i>\" so also <i>sutra</i> : as, \"the पाराशरिणो भिक्षवः \"the <i>Bhikshus</i> who study the <i>Sutras</i> promulgated by <i>Parasara</i>\". शैलालिनो नटाः, कर्मन्दिनः, कृशश्विनः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"<i>Chhandas</i> and <i>Brahmanas</i>\"? Because the प्रोक्त affix after any other word will have its own significance, pure and simple; as, पाणिनीयं व्याकरणम् ॥ पैङ्गीकल्पः ॥\n\nThe Quadruply-significant affixes.",
    "42067": "The words of this aphorism require a detailed examination. तद् 'that', i.e. the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the nominative case. अस्मिन् \"in this\" -- this gives the meaning of the affix; अस्ति \"is\" this qualifies the sense of the base. इति is added merely for the sake of distinctness, serving the same purpose as quotation marks in modern writing. देशेतन्नाम्नि \"a country having that name\"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. The sense is:- \"the affixes already taught or to be taught, come after a word being in the nominative case in construction, in the sense of the location, when the whole word so formed denotes the name of a country in which that thing exists\".\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> and the three subsequent <i>sutras</i> are in fact one, though divided into four, for purposes of convenience. The affixes having the sense of these four <i>sutras</i>, are called चातुरर्थिक \"quadruple significants\".\n\nThus उदुम्बरा अस्मिन् देशे सन्ति = औदुम्बरः <i>Audumbara</i>--the country in which there are glomerous fig trees. Similarly बाल्बजः, पार्वतः &c. all these words are formed by the universal affix अण् [[4.1.83]].\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> debars the अत्वर्थीय affixes.",
    "42068": "The phrase देशे तन्नाम्नि of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this and the two subsequent <i>sutras</i>. By these four <i>sutras</i> the names of countries are formed from various substantives. Thus कुशाम्बेन निर्वृत्ता = कौशाम्बी नगरी  \"the city of <i>Kausambi</i>, completed by <i>Kusamba</i>\". Similarly साहस्री परिखा \"a mote completed by a thousand (gold coins) or persons\". A place is named after the means or the person, by which or through whom it is established.",
    "42069": "The <i>sutra</i> literally means \"his dwelling place\". A place is sometimes named after the people whose habitation it is. Thus शैवः \"the country of the <i>Sibis</i>\", ॠजुनावान्निवासौ देशः = आर्जुनावः ॥ The word ॠजुनावां = ॠज्वीनौर्येषां ॥",
    "42070": "In this aphorism the word, to which the affix is to be added, is not shown. The word तस्य must, therefore, be supplied from the last <i>sutra</i>. It means, therefore, \"an affix is added to a word in the genetive case in construction, in the sense of not far off\" the whole word being the name of a place. Thus विदिशाया अदूर भवं = वैदिशम् is the city in the neighbourhood of which the river <i>Vidisa</i> flows. So also हैमवतम् ॥\n\nThe च has the force of combining the sense of all the three previous aphorisms with this; so that the four <i>sutras</i> 67, 68, 69 and 70 form but one complete <i>sutra</i>, and the meaning denoted by these will be understood in the subsequent aphorisms.",
    "42071": "This of course debars the universal affix अण् [[4.1.83]]. Thus आरडवम् from अरडु 'a tribe of <i>Kshatriyas</i>'; काक्षतवम् from कक्षतु, and कार्कटेलवम् from कर्कटेलू ॥ But from इक्षु we have इक्षुमती 'the river <i>lkshumati</i>, named after the sugarcanes near it'. Here we add the affix मतुप् taught in the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.85]], which debars अञ् by the rule of a subsequent debarring the prior when both are of equal force (1. 4. 2). The affix अञ् governs the six <i>sutras</i> upto [[4.2.77]]. The difference betweenअञ् and अण् consists in the accent.",
    "42072": "The word बह्वजङ्ग is a compound of बह्वच् meaning literally 'many vowels' i. e. polysyllabic, and of अङ्गः meaning stem. A word which, exclusive of the affix मतुप्, consists of more than two syllables, takes the affix अञ् ॥ This debars अण् ॥ Thus ऐषुकावतम्, सैध्रकावतम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after a polysyllabic stem\"? Observe आहिमतम् यावमतम् ॥ Here though the word अहिमत् ends in the affix मतुप्, yet the अङ्ग or the stem viz. अहि, is a word of two syllables only, hence these words take अण् in forming names of countries. In fact, the word बह्वच् qualifies the word अङ्ग, as it stands without the affix मतुप्, and not the word inclusive of that affix. Therefore मालावतां निवासः = मालावतम् by अण् ॥",
    "42073": "This debars अण्. Thus दीर्घवरत्रेण निर्वृत्तः कूपः = दैर्घवरत्रः \"a well completed by <i>Dirghavaratra</i>\". So also कापिलवरत्रः ॥",
    "42074": "This debars अण्; and it applies to all words whether polysyllabic or not. Thus दात्तः \"a well completed by <i>Datta</i>\", गौप्तः &c.\n\nWhy do we say on the \"northern bank\"? Because if a well is situate on the southern bank of the river <i>Vipasa</i>, then the affix अण् will apply as दात्तः and गौप्तः, the difference being in the accent. This <i>sutra</i> illustrates the refined distinctions drawn by the author, and the importance attached to accents in former times.",
    "42075": "This debars अण् ॥ The word संकलः is equivalent to संगतः कलः ॥ Thus सांकलः, पौष्कलः &c.\n\n1 संकल, 2 पुष्कल, 3 उत्तम, 4 उडुप, 5 उद्वेप (उद्वप), 6 उत्पुट, 7 कुम्भ, 8 निधान (विधान), 9 सुदक्ष, 10 सुदत्त, 11 सुभूत, 12 सुपूत, 13 सुनेत्र, 14 सुमङ्गल, 15 सुपिङ्गल, 16 सूत, 17 सिकत (सिकता), 18 पूतिक (पूतिका; पूतीकी), I9 पूलास, 20 कूलास, 21 पलाश, 22 निवेश, 23 गवेष, 24 गम्भीर, 25 इतर, 26 आन्, 27 अहन्, 28 लोमन्, 29 वेमन्, 30 वरुण (चरण), 31 बहुल, 32 सद्योज, 33 अभिषिक्त, 34 गोभृत्, 35 राजभृत्, 36 भल्ल, 37 मल्ल, 38 माल. also 39 शर्मन्, 40 गृह, 41 भूत.",

Thus सुवास्तोरदूरभवं नगरं = सौवास्तवम् ॥ So also वार्णवम् ॥ The use of the word अण्, though its <i>anuvritti</i> came from [[4.1.83]], is for the sake of indicating that this <i>sutra</i> debars <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.85]].

As a general rule all words to which affixes are to be added are put in the ablative case in these <i>sutras</i>. The fact of this exceptional treatment of the word रोणी indicates that this word takes अण् under all circumstances, whether alone, or forming part of a compound. In fact, the nominative case in this <i>sutra</i> is a very ingenious explanatory artificiality. Thus रौणः, आजकरौणः or सैहिकरौणः",
    "42079": "This debars अञ् which would have come by [[4.2.71]] and [[4.2.73]]. Thus कार्णच्छिद्रिकः कूपः ॥ कार्णवाकवम्, त्रैशङ्कवम् ॥",
    "42080": "The above affixes वुञ् &c. are applied to the above classes of words. आदि is to be added to every one of the above seventeen words. The first part of the <i>sutra</i> upto ठक् gives the seventeen affixes, and the latter part gives the seventeen word-class. The allotment or assignment of affixes is made by [[1.3.10]].\n\nThe examples of the above are: (1) आ꣡रीहणकम्, द्रौ꣡घणकम् (2) कार्श्वाश्वी꣡यः, आर꣡ष्टीयः, (3) ऋश्यकः꣡, न्यग्रोधकः꣡, (4) कुमुदिक꣡म्, शर्क्करिक꣡म्, (5) वाशि꣡लम्, काशि꣡लम्, (6), तृणसः꣡, नडसः꣡, (7) प्रेक्षिन्꣡, हलकिन्, (8) अश्मरः꣡, (9) सा꣡खेयम्, सा꣡खिदत्तेयम्, (10) सांकाश्य꣡म्, काम्पिल्य꣡म्, (11) बल्यः꣡, कल्य꣡म्, (12) पाक्षायणः꣡, तौषायणः꣡, (13) का꣡र्णायनिः, वा꣡सिष्ठायनिः, (14) सौत꣡ङ्गमिः, मौ꣡निचित्तिः, (15) प्रा꣡गद्य (16) वाराहक꣡म्, पालाशक꣡म्, and (17) lastly कौमुदिक꣡म् ॥\n\nThe word शिरीष will be seen, by referring to the above lists, to occur in three classes viz अरीहणादि, (36), कुमुदादि (14), and वराहादि (3), Moreover it is governed by the general affix अण् also in the quadruple sense, according to the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>. And because it occurs in the वरणादि class [[4.2.82]], therefore this universal अण् [[4.1.83]] will be elided after it.

    "43009": "The word सांप्रतिक means 'equity, propriety, right, fit'. As नातिदीर्घं नाति हृस्वं मध्यं काष्ठम् \"the proper piece of wood--neither too long nor too short\". मध्ये वैयाकरणः \"the fit Grammarian, neither too refined nor too dull\". मध्यास्त्री \"a proper wife\".",
    "43010": "The word द्वीप occurs in the list of <i>Kachchhadi</i> [[4.2.133]], and would have taken अण्; and by <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.134]], it would have taken वुञ् also. The present <i>sutra</i> debars both those affixes, when the word द्वीप means अनुसमुद्र or 'near the sea'.\n\nThus द्वैप्यम् 'living on or relating to an island'. As द्वैप्यं भवन्तोऽनुचरन्ति चक्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say अनुसमुद्रं ? Observe द्वैपकम् or द्वैपम् [[4.2.133]] and [[4.2.134]]. The word '<i>anu</i>-<i>samudra</i>' is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound (II. I. 15).",
    "43011": "This debars अण् ॥ The affix छ which comes after <i>Vriddha</i> words is prohibited by this <i>sutra</i>. Thus मासिकः 'monthly' आर्द्धमासिकः 'bi-monthly', सांवत्सरिकः 'annual'.\n\nThe words which denote time even indirectly, also take this affix. As कादम्बपुष्पिकं, व्रैहिपलालिकम् ॥ The word काल governs all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto 25. (तत्र जातः).",
    "43012": "This debars अण् [[4.3.16]]. The word श्राद्धे means the 'funeral oblation'; and not श्रद्धावान् पुरुषः 'a faithful or believing person'. Thus शारदिकं श्राद्धं 'the autumnal <i>Sraddha</i>'. When not meaning '<i>Sraddha</i>', it will be शारदम् ॥",
    "43013": "Thus शारदिको रोगः 'the autumnal disease', शारदिक आतपः 'the autumnal heat or sunshine'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when denoting sickness or heat\"? Observe, शारदं दधि 'the autumnal curd'. This ठञ् debars the ऋतु अण् [[4.3.16]].",
    "43014": "This makes optional, where by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.11]] <i>ante</i>, the ठञ् would have been obligatory. Thus नैशम् or नैशिकम् 'nocturnal'. प्रादोषम् or प्रादोषिकम् ॥",
    "43015": "The word श्वस् takes the affix त्यप् by <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.10]]. This <i>sutra</i> ordains ठञ् ॥ When free from the scope of these rules, it takes <i>tyu</i> and <i>tyul</i> affixes also by [[4.3.23]]. Thus श्वस् + तुट् + ठञ् = शौवस् + त् + इक [[7.3.3]] = शौवस्तिकः \"belonging to to-morrow or ephemeral\". Otherwise श्वस्त्यः and श्वस्तनः ॥",
    "43016": "The word कालात् is to be read into the <i>sutra</i>. All the words must be expressive of time. This debars ठञ् ॥ The repetition of अण् debars छ also in the case of those words, which are <i>Vriddha</i> in this list [[4.2.114]]. Thus (1) सान्धिवेलम्, सान्ध्यम् (2) ग्रैष्मम्, शैशिरम् (3) तेषम्, पौषम् are examples of <i>sandhivela</i> season and asterisms respectively.\n\nThe affix अण् is added to संवत्सर when denoting 'fruit' and 'festival', as सांवत्सरं फलं or पर्व ॥\n\n1 संधिवेला, 2 संध्या, 3 अमावास्या, 4 त्रयोदशी, 5 चतुर्दशी, 6 पञ्चदशी, 7 पौर्णमासी, 8 प्रतिपद्, 9 संवत्सरात्फलपर्वणोः ॥",
    "43017": "This debars the अण् of the last <i>sutra</i>, though '<i>pravrish</i>' is a season-denoting word. Thus प्रावृषेण्यो बलाहकः \"the belonging to the rainy season.\"",

    "43020": "This debars अण् [[4.3.16]]. Thus मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतू ॥",
    "43021": "This debars अण् [[4.3.16]]. Thus सहश्च सहस्यश्च हैम꣡न्तिकावृतू ॥ The making of two separate <i>Sutras</i> of 20 and 21, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of word हेमन्त only is taken.",
    "43022": "Thus हैमनम् वासः 'wintery residence.' हैमनमुपलेपनम् ॥\n\nThe word सर्वत्र is used to show that the <i>sutra</i> applies in the <i>Chhandas</i> as well as in the secular literature.\n\nThe word हेमन्त will take अण् by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.16]] as हैमन्ती पङ्क्तिः but there is no elision of त there. Thus there are three forms हैमन्तः [[4.3.16]], हैमन्तिकं [[4.3.21]] and हैमनम् ॥",
    "43023": "The word कालात् is understood here also. Thus सायं + ट्यु =  सायं + तुट् + ट्यु = सायंतनम् (VII. I. 1) 'belonging to the evening'. चिरंतनम्, 'lasting', प्राह्णेतनम् 'what is of the forenoon', प्रागेतनम् \"what is of the early morn\".\n\nThe word सायं is a word ending in म् and is an Indeclinable. These affixes would also come by virtue of its being an indeclinable, after that सायं ॥ The present सायं is derived from the root से by adding the affix घञ् ॥ It always ends in म् when these affixes are added. The word चिरं always ends in म् ॥ प्राह्णे and प्रगे always end in ए ॥\n\nAs regards Indeclinables, the examples are दोषातनम् 'belonging to the night'. दिवातनम् 'belonging to the day'.\n\nVart:- The affix त्न comes after the words चिर, परुत् and परारि ॥ As चिरत्नम्, परुत्नम्, and परारित्नम् ॥\n\nVart:- The ग of प्रग in elided in the <i>Chhandas</i> before this affix त्न. as, प्रत्नम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix डिमच् comes after अग्र, आदि and पश्चाद्; as, अग्रिमम्, आदिमम् and पश्चिमम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after अन्त, as, अन्तिमम् ॥\n\nThe defference between <i>tyu</i> and <i>tyul</i> is in accent, Thus सायन्त꣡न and साय꣡न्तन, चिरन्त꣡न and चिर꣡न्तन, प्राह्णेत꣡न and प्राह्णे꣡तन, प्रगेत꣡न, प्रगे꣡तन, दिवात꣡न and दिवा꣡तन, दोषात꣡न and दोषा꣡तन ॥",

With <i>tyul</i>, we have पूर्वाह्णेत꣡नं and अपराह्णेत꣡नं ॥  The sign of the locative is not elided by rule [[6.3.17]]. When the word is taken as incapable of having the case-affix, we have, पूवाह्णत꣡नं or पूर्वाह्ण꣡तनः ॥",
    "43025": "The affixes अण् &c. घ &c. have been taught, but no particular sense was assigned to them. See [[4.2.92]]. This <i>sutra</i> gives one of the senses, and also declares the particular case in which the stem must be, to which the affix is to be added. Thus स्रुघ्नेजातः = स्रुघ्न + अण् = स्रौघ्नः 'born in <i>Srughna</i>'. So also माथुरः 'born in <i>Mathura</i>', औत्सः 'born in <i>Utsa</i>', औदपानः 'born in <i>Udapana</i>'. राष्ट्रियः [[4.2.93]], अवारपारीणः [[4.2.93]] शाकलिकः [[4.2.117]], ग्राम्यः [[4.2.94]], ग्रामीणः [[4.2.94]], कात्रेयकः [[4.2.95]] औम्भेयकः [[4.2.95]].",

    "43027": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus शारदका दर्भाः 'the grass called <i>Saradaka</i>'. शारदका मुद्गाः 'the pulse called <i>Saradaka</i>.'\n\nWhy do we say संज्ञायां ? Observe शारदं सस्यम् 'the autumnal crop.'\n\nAccording to some, the word संज्ञायां governs all the succeeding <i>sutras</i> up to [[4.3.38]].",

    "43030": "This debars अण् of [[4.3.16]]. Thus अमावास्यकः or आमावास्यः ॥ This affix वुन् is applied to the word अमावस्य also, on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् \"That which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place\". Thus अमावस्यकः or आमावस्यः ॥",

    "43033": "Thus सैन्धवः꣡ and आ꣡पकरः ॥",
    "43034": "The feminine affixes are also elided after these words by [[1.2.49]]. Thus श्रविष्ठासु जातः = श्रविष्ठः 'produced under <i>Sravishtha</i>'. So also फल्गुनः, अनुराधः, स्वातिः, तिष्यः, पुनर्वसुः, हस्तः, विशाखः, आषाढः, बहुलः ॥ The '<i>Bahula</i>' is another Name of the asterism कृत्तिका ॥\n\nVart:- So also the affix is elided after the asterisms चित्रा, रेवती and रोहिणी when the word is feminine. Thus चित्रायां जाता 'a woman produced under <i>Chitra</i>' will be called चित्रा ॥  So also रेवती, रोहिणी ॥ The feminine affix  which would have been elided after the two words <i>Revati</i> and <i>Rohini</i>, by (I. 2. 49.) is reordained by [[4.1.41]], because these words belong to गौरादि class.\n\nVart:- The affixes ट and अन् come respectively after फल्गुनी꣡ and आषाढा꣡ in forming the Feminine derivatives. As फल्गुनी꣡ (IV. I. 15) and अषाढा꣡ ॥ The difference is in accent and meaning.\n\nVart:- The affix छण् also comes after '<i>Sravishtha</i>' and '<i>ashadha</i>' As श्राविष्ठीयः and आषाढीयः ॥",
    "43035": "Thus गोस्थाने जातः = गोस्थानः, अश्वस्थानः, गोशालः, खरशालः ॥",
    "43036": "As वत्सशालायां जातः = वत्सशालः or वात्सशालः, अभिजित् or आभिजितः, अश्वयुक् or आश्वयुजः, शतभिक् or शातभिषजः ॥ The two words वत्सशाल and वत्सशाला are both to be taken. These are all diversities of बहुल as used in the next <i>sutra</i>.",
    "43037": "Thus रोहिणः or रौहिणः [[4.3.16]] मृगशिरा or मार्गशीर्षः [[4.3.16]].",

    "43041": "Except the word 'adapted' which is the meaning of the word संभूत, all the other words of the <i>sutra</i> have been supplied from the previous aphorisms. The word संभूत does not mean in this <i>sutra</i> 'origin' or 'existence', for the word जात and भव already express that notion. It here means 'suitableness' 'adequacy' i.e. अवक्लृप्तिः and प्रमाणातिरेकः ॥\n\nThus स्रुघ्ने संभवति = सौघ्नः 'what is suited to the country of <i>Srughna</i>.'

    "43042": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus कोशे संभूतं = कौशेयं वस्त्रम् 'silken clothes'.\n\nThe word कोश means 'cocoon.' कौशेयः may literally therefore mean 'anything suited to the cocoon,' and may apply to the caterpillar as well as to the silk made out of cocoon. The word कौशेय is however रूढि and means 'silken.' Nor does it mean 'suited to the sheath,' as a sword, though <i>kosa</i> means 'sheath' also. This <i>sutra</i> would have been more properly placed after [[4.3.134]], under the heading of विकार rather than of संभूत ॥\n\nIn fact after the <i>sutra</i> एण्या-ढञ् [[4.3.159]], the addition of कोशाच्च would have been more appropriate.",
    "43043": "Thus हेमन्ते साधुः = हैमन्तः 'what is good or pleasant in autumn' as हैमन्तः प्राकारः शैशिरमनुलेपम् ॥ So also वसन्ते पुष्प्यन्ति = वासन्त्यः 'vernal creepers i. e. which flower in spring', ग्रैष्म्यः पाटलाः ॥ So also शरदि पच्यन्ते = शारदाः शालयः 'the grains that ripen in autumn'. ग्रैष्मा यवाः 'the barley that ripens in summer'.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> teaches the base and the sense of the affix. It does not directly teach the affix. The above illustrations are examples of the affix अण् &c.",
    "43044": "Thus हेमन्ते उप्यन्ते = हैमन्ता यवाः 'the barley sown in autumn.' ग्रैष्मा व्रीहयः ॥\n\nThe separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of उप्त only goes, which could not have been the case had this word been included in the last <i>sutra</i>.",
    "43045": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus आश्वयुज्या मुप्ताः = आश्वयुजका माषाः 'the pulse sown in <i>Asvayuji</i>.' It is the name of the full-moon in the Asterism of <i>Asvini</i>. <i>Asvayuj</i> and<i> </i>Asvini_ are the same. Some texts read अश्वनी instead of अश्विनी ॥",
    "43046": "This debars अण् [[4.3.16]]. Thus ग्रैष्मम् or ग्रैष्मकम् सस्यम् 'the crop sown in summer'. वासन्तम् or वासन्तकम् ॥",
    "43047": "Thus मासे देयमृणं = मासिकं 'a debt due in a month'. आर्द्धमासिकम्, सांवत्सरिकम् ॥ Why do we say ऋणे 'it being a debt'. Observe मासेदेया भिक्षा where no affix is added.",
    "43048": "The words कलापी &c are words which indirectly denote time. Thus the time in which the peacocks mate and make noise is called कलापी ॥ The time in which the <i>asvatha</i> tree fructifies is called अश्वत्थः ॥ The time in which barley is thrashed out is called यवबुस 'barley-chaff'? Thus कलापिनिकाले देयमृणं = कलापकम् 'a debt to be paid when the peacocks make noise (i. e. mating or rainy season) tails.' अश्वत्थकम् and यवबुसकम् ॥",
    "43049": "This debars the अण् and ठञ् ॥ Thus ग्रीष्मेदेयमृणं = ग्रैष्मकम् ॥ So also आवरसमकम् ॥ This affix causes <i>Vriddhi</i>, while वुन् would not have done it. Hence the separate affix. The word समा is synonymous with वर्ष 'a year'. The word आवरसमकम् means either आगामिनां संवत्सराणामाद्यवत्सरे देयम् or अतीते वत्सरे देयं यद्यपि न दत्तम् ॥",
    "43050": "Thus संवत्सरे देयमृणं = सांवत्सरिकं, and सांवत्सरकं ॥ आग्रहायणिकं or आग्रहायणकं ॥\n\nThe word संवत्सर occurs in <i>Sandhiveladi</i> Class [[4.3.16]] and takes अण् when 'fruit' or 'festivity' is meant. The present <i>sutra</i> enjoins ठञ् when 'debt' is indicated.",
    "43051": "Thus निशायां व्याहरति मृगः \"an animal that wanders at night.\" So also प्रादोषः or प्रादोषिकः [[4.3.14]] 'a brute that yells in the morning.'\n\nWhy do we say मृगः 'a beast' ? Observe निशायां व्याहरति उलूकः ॥ Here there is no affixing. The word व्याहरति also means 'to make noise.' The <i>Sutra</i> may, therefore, also be translated as : \"After a word denoting time, an affix [[4.1.83]] comes in expressing a wild beast who makes noise at that time\".",
    "43052": "The word कालात् is understood here also. तद् = that : सोढम् = जितम् or अभ्यस्तं \"endured or habituated\". Thus निशा सहचरितमध्ययनं = निशा \"reading by night\". तत् सोढमस्य छात्रस्य = नैशः or नैशिकः 'a student who is habituated or enured to reading by night'. So प्रादोषिकः or प्रादोषः ॥",
    "43053": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of कालात् ceases. The sense of भव here is 'existence', and not that of 'birth' : because the sense of 'birth' is taught in <i>sutra</i> तत्र जातः [[4.3.25]].

They must refer to non-corporeal or abstract objects. As सेनामुख्यं 'who stays in the van of the army'. सेनाजघन्यन् 'who stays in the rear of the army'. In fact, the words '<i>mukha</i>' and '<i>jaghana</i>' here mean the 'van' and the 'rear' of an army. The word उदक् takes this affix, when the word so formed is a Name.

    "43056": "Thus दार्तेयम् 'what stays in a leathern bag', कौक्षेयम्, कालशेयम्, वास्तेयम्, आस्तेयम् and आहेयम् ॥ आहेयम् is the name of a poison. The word अस्ति is a noun and not a verb here. Its use as a Noun is to be seen in phrases like अस्तिक्षीरा गौः, अस्तिमान् = धनवान् ॥",

So also '<i>Tainga</i>-- a Commentary on Verbal affixes' कार्तः '<i>Karta</i>-- a Commentary on <i>krit</i> affixes'. सौप &c. may also mean सुप्सु भवं &c.\n\nWhy do we say व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः 'after the name of the thing explainable'? The thing to be explained must be a Book, therefore, the affix will not apply to the name of a city &c. For example, if a model be made to describe the city of <i>Pataliputra</i>, such a model will not be named after <i>Pataliputra</i> by the addition of affix. Thus सुकोशला is a modal giving a description of <i>Pataliputra</i>. This will not be called <i>Pataliputram</i>.\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of भव and व्याख्यान runs simultaneosly in all the subsequent <i>apavada</i> <i>sutras</i>, and hence we have read the <i>anuvritti</i> of भव into this <i>sutra</i> also.",

The words '<i>vajapeya</i>' and '<i>rajasuya</i>' are acute in the middle.\n\nThe words क्रतु and यज्ञ mean generally the same thing i.e. 'a sacrifice', but the separate mention of यज्ञ implies that the rule applies to <i>yajnas</i> other than <i>Soma</i>-<i>yajnas</i> because the word '<i>kratu</i>' is technically applied to <i>Soma</i>-, sacrifices only.

    "43100": "The words of this <i>sutra</i> require a detailed analysis. जनपदिनाम् gen. plural of जनपदिन् meaning 'Iord of an inhabited country' i. e. <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes, बहुवचने 'in the plural', जनपदेन समान शब्दानां 'the same form as the <i>jana</i>- <i>pada</i> denoting word', जनपदवत् सर्वम् 'every thing is like <i>jana</i>-<i>pada</i>'. In other words, 'after those bases denoting <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes which in the plural have the same forms as the names of the countries, the affix in the sense of veneration will be the same as will come after a <i>janapada word</i>.' Now the affixes denoting  भक्ति as regards जनपद words are given in <i>Sutras</i> [[4.2.124]] &c. and those affixes will apply here. Thus अङ्गा जनपदो भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by वुञ् of <i>Sutra</i> [[4.2.125]], meaning 'who loves the country of <i>Angas</i>' Similarly वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः पौन्द्रकः ॥\n\nSimilarly अङ्गाः क्षत्रिया भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by the same affix वुञ्, with this difference of meaning 'who loves the <i>Kshatriyas</i> called <i>Angas</i>'. So वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'of <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes'; (<i>janapadinam</i>). Observe, पंचाला ब्राह्मणा भक्तिरस्य = पांचालाः ॥ Here the general affix अण् is employed.\n\nThe word सर्व is used in the <i>sutra</i> to show that not only the affixes are the same, but the bases to which the affixes are added will be the same. In the plural, the <i>Kshatriya</i> and the <i>Janapada</i> bases have the same form, but in the singular and dual, the forms of <i>Kshatriya</i>-bases are different. Thus मद्रस्यापत्यं = sing. माद्रः [[4.1.170]] dual, माद्रौ pl. मद्राः. The form मद्राः denotes both 'the Kings or <i>Kshatriyas</i> of <i>Madras</i>' as well as 'the country called <i>Madras</i>'. Thus मद्रो भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ So also in the singular and dual, मद्राः will be the base to which the affix will be added. Thus माद्रो भक्तिरस्य माद्रौ वा भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ Similarly वार्ज्य (from वृजि [[4.1.171]]), as वार्ज्यो वा भक्तिरस्य वार्ज्यौ वा भक्तिरस्य = वृजिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say जनपदेन समान शब्दानाम् 'the word having the same sound as the <i>janapada</i> word'? Thus अनुषण्डो जनपदः, पौरवो राजा स भक्तिरस्य = पौरवीयः ॥ Here <i>Paurava</i> and <i>Anushanda</i> have not the same sound.\n\nThe word बहुवचने is used in the <i>sutra</i>, to indicate, that, though the समान शब्दता or 'the similarity of word-form', occurs in the plural number only, yet this <i>atidesa</i> rule applies to the same words in the singular and dual also. For in the plural, the form will be same, because there the <i>Tadraja</i> affix is elided; but in the singular and dual, the <i>Tadraja</i> affix is not elided, and therefore, the word denoting a principality and the word denoting a prince will not have the same form; but this rule applies there also. As वाङ्गः or वाङ्गौ भक्तिरस्य वाङ्गकः ॥",
    "43101": "The word प्रोक्तं means प्रकर्षेणोक्तं 'preeminently spoken'. It should be distinguished from the word कृत meaning 'done or made'. For the sense of कृतं has been already taught in the <i>sutra</i> कृते ग्रन्थे [[4.3.16]]. Thus अन्येन कृता माथुरेण प्रोक्ता = माथुरी वृत्तिः ॥ पाणिनीयम् 'the system of grammar enounced by <i>Panini</i>' आपिशलम्, काशकृत्स्नम् ॥\n\nWorks like <i>Chhandas</i> which were made (कृतं) by nobody, but which were promulgated (प्रोक्तं) from time of time by inspired commentators, may be quoted as examples of the application of this <i> sutra</i>. Or it may apply to the case of a book whose author is another, but whose promulgator or expounder is another. In short, speaking roughly, प्रोक्त is a 'revelation', and कृतः is a 'composition', once a revealer or prophet, the other an author.\n\nAccording to some, this <i>sutra</i> is almost a superfluity. They argue thus: The word प्रोक्त is formed by adding प्र to वच and means 'to lecture' 'he teach', and also the 'means of such teaching &c'. In the first sense of 'lecturing or teaching', the affix is not found. For in every village there are persons who teach or lecture upon <i>Katha</i>, <i>Kalapa</i> &c. For example सुशर्मन् may be such a lecturer, but we do not say सुशर्मणा प्रोक्तं काठकं = सौशर्मणम् ॥ Moreover, where we find this affix employed, it is with regard to Books, for which the rule कृते ग्रन्थे is sufficient. If it be said that it should be taught for the <i>Chhandas</i>: that is also unnecessary, as the <i>Vedas</i> are not कृत but eternal, the agent only remembers them. If it be said, it refers to the sense of the Vedas, the same objection applies as to the first. But the letter of the <i>Veda</i> is not eternal, it is the sense that is eternal. Therefore the <i>Rishis</i> who revealed, for the first time, at the beginning of a <i>Kalpa</i>, the sense of the <i>Veda</i>, in appropriate language will be called its promulgators, and the works so revealed will be named after such <i>Rishis</i>, as काठकम्, कालापकम् and मौदकम् ॥ This <i>sutra</i>, however, is confined to those cases where the author of the book is one person and its promulgator is another : as माथुरी वृत्तिः ॥",

Certainly not of the primitive, for लुक् is never applied to the elision of a base, but of an affix only [[1.1.61]]. It follows therefore that the elision is of the affixes of कंसीय and परशव्य ॥ Now these words have two affixes, thus. To the root कम् is added first the <i>Unadi</i> affix स (<i>Un</i> III. 62) and we get कंस; next to कंस is added छ. So also to पर + शृ is added the affix उ (<i>Un</i> I. 33) and we have परशु, to which is then added यत् and we have परशव्य ॥ The question arises, should these affixes स and उ be also elided. The answer is 'no'. The word प्रातिपदिकात् of [[4.1.1]] is understood is this <i>sutra</i>; so the elision will take place of those affixes only which follow a <i>pratipadika</i>. But स and उ are added to a <i>Dhatu</i> and not a <i>pratipadika</i>, hence those affixes are saved from the operation of लुक् ॥\n\nThe word परशव्य being gravely accented on the first [[6.1.185]] would have taken अञ् by [[4.3.140]].

Thus देवदत्तेन जितम् will not give rise to any affix, for the word दैवदक्तिकः is not found in usage having this sense. So also अंगुल्या खनति gives rise to no affix. Though the verbs '<i>divyati</i>' &c, are in the 3rd Person Present Tense, Singular number, the derivative is not limited by these conditions.

Thus प्रतीपं वर्तते = प्रातीपिकः (प्रतिगता आपोऽस्मिन्, the आ changed to ई [[5.4.74]] and [[6.3.97]] retrograde i. e. 'which is unfavourable.' So आन्वीपिकः 'favorable.' प्रतिलोमिकः 'inverse' आनुलोमिकः 'direct.' पातिकूलिकः, आनुकूलिकः The two words प्रातीपिक and आन्वीपिक mean 'unfavourable' and 'favourable' respectively.",
    "44029": "Thus परिमुखं वर्तते = पारिमुखिकः 'being before the face,' 'being near or present'.\n\nThe word च in the <i>sutra</i> implies that the affix applies to other words also not mentioned. As पारिपार्श्विकः ॥ The word परिमुख is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound (II. I. 12). If परि has the force of exclusion [[1.4.88]], then पारिमुखिकः will mean 'a servant who always avoids the face of his master' \"स्वामिनो मुखं वर्जयित्वा सेवको वर्त्तते,\" and if परि means 'all round,' then the word will mean \"a servant who is always in the presence of his master -- यतः स्वामिनो मुखं ततस्ततो वर्त्तते\"॥",
    "44030": "Thus द्विगुणं प्रयच्छति = द्विगुणिकः 'a usurer who gives for the sake of double' i. e. who charges cent per cent interest. The word द्विगुण means द्विगुणार्थ 'for the sake of double'. Similarly त्रैगुणिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The word वृद्धि is changed to वृधुषि before this affix. As, वृद्धिं प्रयच्छति = वार्धुषिकः 'a usurer' 'who gives for the sake of increase' Or the word वृधुषि may be taken as a separate word synonymous with वृद्धि ॥\n\nWhy do we say गर्ह्यम् 'with a mean motive'? Observe द्विगुणं प्रयच्छति अधर्मणः 'the debtor gives double'.",
    "44031": "The word कुसीद means 'interest'. The lending of ten (दश) on a condition that the borrower will pay eleven (एकादश) after a month is called दशैकादश ॥ This <i>sutra</i> debars ठक् ॥ The difference between the two affixes ष्ठन् and ष्ठच् is in the accent [[6.1.197]] and [[6.1.163]] Thus कुसीद + ष्ठन् = कु꣡सीदकः fem. कुसीदकी꣡ [[6.1.41]]. So दशैकादशिकः꣡ fem की꣡ ॥",
    "44032": "Thus बदराण्युञ्छति = बादरिकः 'who picks up jujubes'. श्यामाकिकः, काणिकः ॥ To pick up every grain (कण) fallen on the ground is called उञ्छ ॥",
    "44033": "Thus समाजं रक्षति = सामाजिकः 'a spectator', lit. 'who aids an assembly by his presence'. So also सांनिवेशिकः ॥",
    "44034": "Thus शब्दं करोति = शाब्दिकः 'who makes a sound' i. e. a Grammarian. So दार्दुरिकः 'who makes a croaking noise like a frog (<i>dardura</i>)' i. e, a potter.",
    "44035": "Thus पक्षिणो हन्ति = पाक्षिकः 'a bird-killer'. The affix applies not only to the word-forms पक्षि &c, but to words denoting birds &c. (See (I. I. 68)). Therefore, we have forms शाकुनिकः, मायूरिकः, तैत्तिरिकः ॥ So also with मत्स्य, as, मात्स्यिकः, मैनिकः, शाफरिकः, शाकुलिकः ॥ So also with मृगः, as मार्गिकः, हारिणिकः, सौकरिकः, सारङ्गिकः ॥",
    "44036": "Thus परिपन्थं तिष्ठति = पारिपन्थिकः यः पन्थानं वर्जयित्वा तिष्ठति, यो वा पन्थानं व्याप्य तिष्ठति 'a thief' lit. \"who stays at roads, a high way man\". The च in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the sense of हन्ति 'who kills' of the last, is to be connected with this <i>sutra</i> by the conjunction 'and'. Thus परिपन्थं हन्ति = पारिपन्थिकः ॥\n\nThe phrase 'being in the second case in construction' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, why has then the word परिपन्थम् been shown in the second case in the <i>sutra</i>, for it is a mere superfluity? No, it shows the secular form of the word. The word परिपन्थ is synonymous with परिपन्थ, the latter, however, having other senses also.",
    "44037": "Thus दण्डमाथं धावति = दाण्डमाथिकः 'who runs on a high way'. So also शौल्कमाथिकः ॥ Similarly पादविकः, आनुपदिकः ॥ The word माथ means 'a way'.",
    "44038": "The word आक्रन्द means 'a place where persons weep' e.g. a battle - field. It also means 'weeping' 'invoking' &c. The difference between ठक् and ठञ् in the accent. Thus आक्रन्दं धावति = आक्रन्दिकः꣡ or आ꣡क्रन्दिकः, f. आक्रन्दिकी 'a person who runs to a place where cries of distress are heard'.",
    "44039": "Thus पूर्वपदं गृह्णाति = पौर्वपदिकः, so also औत्तरपदिकः ॥ The word उत्तरपद is used in order to prevent the application of the rule when पद is preceded by the affix बहु ॥",
    "44040": "Thus प्रतिकण्ठं गृह्णाति = प्रातिकण्ठिकः ॥ So also आर्थिकः, लालामिकः ॥ The word प्रतिकण्ठ here is an <i>Avyayi</i>-<i>bhava</i> meaning कण्ठं कण्ठं प्रति, and not प्रतिगतः कण्ठं = प्रतिकण्ठ, for to the latter no affix is added.",
    "44041": "Thus धर्मम् चरति = धार्मिकः \"religious\". So also आधर्मिकः \"irreligious undutiful\", by a <i>Vartika</i>.",

    "44043": "The word समवाय means 'combination, collection &c'. The word समवायान् is in the plural number in the <i>sutra</i>, indicating that the <i>svarupa</i>-<i>vidhi</i> (1. 1. 69) does not apply; the affix being applied not only to the word-form समवाय but to its synonyms also. समवैति means coming together. Thus समवायान् समवैति = सामवायिकः 'who assembles in an assembly'. So also सामाजिकः, सामूहिकः, सान्निवेशिकः ॥",
    "44044": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus परिषदं समवैति = पारिषद्यः 'one present in a council, an assessor, a councillor'.",
    "44045": "This debars ठक् which comes in the alternative. Thus सेनां समवैति = सैन्यः or सैनिकः 'a soldier, a member of an army'.",
    "44046": "Thus ललाटं पश्यति = लालाटिकः 'a non-attentive servant' lit. 'who alway looks at the fore-head of his master from a distance, keeps himself aloof, does not come near to perform any work.' So also कौक्कुटिकः 'a religious mendicant, a <i>Bhikshu</i>.' The space of ground over which a hen can fly without falling, is to be understood here by the word कुक्कुटी ॥ In other words, a small space of ground, for hens cannot sustain their flight for a long distance. Therefore, owing to the smallness of space, the mendicant walks looking down over the ground, and hence he is called कौक्कुटिकः ॥ The word also means 'a hypocrite with down-cast eyes.'",
    "44047": "The word धर्म्यं means 'usual,' 'relating to custom'. The word तस्य shows the case of the word. Thus शुल्कशालाया धर्म्यं = शौल्कशालिकः 'the custom-house laws or usages.' So also आकरिकम्, आपणिकम्, गौल्मिकम् ॥",
    "44048": "This debars <i>thak</i>. Thus महिष्या धर्म्यं = माहिषम् 'the usages of queens.' So प्राजावतम् ॥\n\n1 महिषी, 2 प्रजापति, 3 प्रजावती, 4 प्रलेपिका, 5 विलेपिका, 6 अनुलेपिका, 7 पुरोहित, 8 वणिपाली, 9 अनुचारक (अनुवारक), 10 होतु, 11 यजमान.",
    "44049": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus पोतु र्धर्म्यम् = पौत्रम् 'the office of a <i>Potri</i>.' औद्गात्रम् 'the office or duties of an <i>Udgatri</i>'. <i>Padamanjari</i> gives the example of हौत्रम् = होतु र्धर्म्यम् under this <i>sutra</i>, though the word होतृ occurs in the list given in the preceding <i>sutra</i>. The <i>Hotri</i> of the preceding <i>sutra</i> means a <i>Ritvik</i>, here it means an invoker.\n\nVart:- So also after the word नरः As नरस्य धर्म्या = नारी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word विशसितृ, the इट् affix being elided. Thus विशसितृ + अञ् = वैशस्त्रम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word विभाजयितृ, its णि affix also being elided. Thus विभाजयितृ + अञ् = वैभाजित्रम् ॥",
    "44050": "The word अवक्रय means 'Government-tax,' 'price,' 'wages,' 'rent' &c, coming from the root अवक्री 'to purchase.' Thus शुल्कशालाया अवक्रयः = शौल्कशालिकः So also आपणिकः, गौल्मिकः, आकरिकः ॥\n\nAre not धर्म्य [[4.4.47]] and अवक्रय the same ? No. <i>Dharmya</i> is a legal due, and religious; while an '<i>avakraya</i>' may be a tax exacted from a people by oppression, and so transgressing <i>dharma</i>.",

    "44058": "This affix ठक् is added by च, the difference being in accent. Thus पारश्वधिकः or पारश्वधिकः ॥ परश्वध means 'an axe'.",

Thus परलोकोऽस्ति इति यस्य मतिरस्ति स आस्तिकः, an <i>Astika</i> is he who believes that the Hereafter is. Contrary to him is a नास्तिकः who does not believe in a Hereafter. A person who believes what is demonstrated by proof, and nothing else, may also be called दैष्टिकः 'a positivist'. These various other senses are to be found from dictionary and general literature.",

It must always be prefixed by some <i>upasarga</i>; thus आस्था, संस्था, अवस्था &c.\n\nAccording to <i>Patanjali</i> छात्र means 'a pupil, because, गुरुश्छत्रवत् गुरुणा शिष्यश्छत्रवत् छाद्यः \"a preceptor is like an Umbrella, the preceptor covers or protects the pupil like an umbrella\".

Similarly द्वैयन्यिकः त्रैयन्यिकः &c. He whose, in recitation, at the time of examination, there is the occurrence of one mistake or false reading, is called ऐकान्यिकः ॥ So who commits two mistakes is called द्वैयन्यिकः ॥ In short, in giving explanatory analysis of <i>taddhita</i> words like ऐकान्तिकः &c, the whole phrase अध्ययने कर्मवृत्तम् must be employed.",
    "44064": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus:- द्वादशान्यानि कर्माण्यध्ययने वृत्तानि अस्य = द्वादशान्यिकः 'an examinee who commits twelve mistakes in his reading'. So त्रयोदशान्यिकः, चतुर्दशान्यिकः ॥ The word अन्यत् in these <i>sutras</i> means the 'error', especially in accent, i. e. he who makes an accent अनुदात्त which ought to be <i>udatta</i>, or vice versa.",
    "44065": "The words तद् and अस्य (IV. 4. 5I) are understood. The word हितं governs dative (II. 3. 13, <i>Vart</i>). But the <i>sutra</i> is तदस्य हितं भक्षाः, the word अस्य being in the genitive case, how is this? Here अस्य should be changed to dative viz. तदस्मै हितं भक्षाः 'this for whom is wholesome diet'. The best way however, to remove this objection is to read <i>sutras</i> [[4.4.65]], and [[4.4.66]] in this wise: [[4.4.65]] हितं भक्षाः तदस्मै and दीयते नियुक्तं ॥ Thus अपूपंभक्षणं हितमस्मै = आपूपिकः 'He for whom cake is good food' i. e. who eats cakes with benefit, or who is fond of cakes. So also शाष्कुलिकः, मौदकिकः ॥ In analysing these <i>taddhitas</i>, such as आपूपिकः &c, the word हितं or its synonym, and a verb denoting eating should be employed.",
    "44066": "The word दीयते नियुक्तम् means नियोगेन i.e. अव्यभिचारेण दीयते 'to be given by appointment or rightfully'. Thus अग्रे भोजनमस्मै नियुक्तं दीयते = आग्रभोजनिकः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> always entitled to occupy the foremost seat at dinner'. So also आपूपिकः 'entitled to get cakes', शाष्कुलिकः ॥ Some say that the word नियुक्तं means नित्यं 'always'. According to them आपूपिकः would mean अपूपा नित्यमस्मै दीयन्ते 'to whom always cakes are given'.",
    "44067": "This टिठन् debars ठक् ॥ The इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the ट् indicates that the feminine is formed by ङीप् [[4.1.154]]. Thus श्राणा नियुक्तमस्मै दीयते = श्राणिकः f. श्राणिकी 'who is entitled to get rice gruel'. So also मांसौदनिकः f. मांसौदनिकी ॥\n\nThe difference between ठक् and टिठन् is in accent, the former having <i>udatta</i> on the final [[6.1.165]], the latter on the initial [[6.1.197]]. The feminine of ठक् and टिठन् will both be formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]]. Now the affix ठञ् resembles टिठन् both in accent [[6.1.197]] and in feminine [[4.1.15]]. Why was not ठञ् used instead of टिठन्, for it would have produced exactly the same forms ? True, as regards the words श्राणा and मांसौदन the affix ठञ् might have been employed instead of टिठन् ॥ According to some, however, the affix टिठन् applies to मांस and ओदन separately also. But ठञ् cannot be applied to ओदन as it would cause <i>Vriddhi</i> [[7.2.117]] which टिठन् does not. Thus ओदन् + टिठन् = ओदनिकः, f. ओदनिकी ॥ With ठञ् the form would have been औदनिकः which is not wanted.\n\nThe word श्राणा is a Past Participle (क्त) of श्राणा 'to cook.' The श्रा is not changed to श्रृ as required by [[6.1.27]]. This is an anomaly. The <i>nistha</i> त is changed to ण [[8.2.43]]. The form श्राता is also found, as in (VI. I. 36), and the regular form is शृतं = क्षीरम् [[6.1.27]].",

    "44069": "Thus शुल्कशालायां नियुक्तः = शौल्कशालिकः 'a superintendent of custom-house.' So also आकरिकः, आपणिकः, गौलूमिकः, दौवारिकः ॥ The word तत्रनियुक्त is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound formed by [[2.1.46]]. The word <i>niyukta</i> here has a different meaning from that in [[4.1.60]], hence its repetition here.",
    "44070": "This debars ठक् । The difference is in accent and want of <i>Vriddhi</i>. Thus देवागारे नियुक्तः = देवगारिकः, कोष्ठागारिकः, भाण्डागारिकः ॥",
    "44071": "The word अदेशकाल means the time or place of study, which is prohibited by sacred institutes. अध्यायिन् means one who studies. Thus श्मशानेऽधीते = श्माशानिकः 'who reads in a funeral ground.' चतुष्पथिकः 'who studies where four roads meet.' So also चतुर्दश्यामधीते = चातुर्दशिकः, 'who reads on the 14th lunar day.' So also आमावास्यिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'improper time and place ?' Observe स्रुघ्नेऽधीते, पूर्वाह्णेऽधीते ॥",

    "44073": "This rule applies in forming epithets, denoting such persons, who are allowed under the Sacred Institutes, to dwell near human habitations. Thus आरण्यकाः are those ascetics who are ordained to dwell in forests, at least two miles away from human habitations. नैकटिकाः are those ascetics who are allowed by the rule of their Order to live near human habitations. Thus निकटे वसति = नैकटिकः 'an ascetic.'",
    "44074": "The ल् of ष्ठल् is for accent (VI. I. 193), the ष् is for ङीष् [[4.1.41]]. Thus आवसथे वसति = आवसथिकः 'who dwells in a house' i. e. a domestic person as opposed to an ascetic. The feminine will be आवसथिकी ॥ So far was the scope of ठक् as ordained in [[4.4.1]]. Henceforward other affixes will be ordained.",

    "44076": "Thus रथं वहति = र꣡थ्यः 'what bears a car' a carriage-horse. Similarly यु꣡ग्यः 'a yoke-bearing ox', प्रासंग्यः 'being trained in a break'. प्रासङ्ग is a piece of wood placed on the neck of colts, at the time of breaking. This rule applies to compounds ending with <i>ratha</i>, as, परमरथ्य ॥ See [[4.3.121]], [[4.3.123]] also. That which carries will be called 'carrier' or वोढृ therefore रथस्य वोढृ will get the affix यत् by [[4.2.120]], read with [[4.3.121]]. Its special mention here indicates that the affix will come, even after <i>Dvigu</i> compounds and will not be elided by (IV. I. 88). Thus द्वौ रथौ वहति = द्विरथ्यः ॥ The <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies to this word as we have shown under [[4.3.121]]. The word युग्य has been already formed by the <i>krit</i> affix [[3.1.121]], that युग्य differs from the present, in accent when the word takes the negative particle, for that was by ल्यप् and this is by यत्, and therefore by [[6.2.156]], अयुग्य꣡म् will be finally acute when formed by यत् ॥ The word युगं must mean 'the portion of a car' for the application of this rule, and not a cycle of time &c. Therefore not here युगं वहति राजा कलिं द्वापरं वा ॥",
    "44077": "Thus धुरं वहति = धुर्यः (formed by यत्) the lengthening ordained by [[8.2.77]] is prevented by [[7.2.79]] because धुर is <i>Bha</i>-stem, or धौरेयः (formed by डक् [[7.1.2]]) 'a beast of burden'. This <i>sutra</i> might have stood as धुरो ढक् च, for यत् would have been read into it from [[4.4.75]].",
    "44078": "Thus सर्वधुरां वहति = सर्वधुरीणः [[7.1.2]]. The affix ख applies to other compounds also ending in धुर, e.g. उत्तरधुरीणः, दक्षिनधुरीणः ॥ The word सर्वधुर is a compound of सर्वा + धुर् [[2.1.49]], the <i>samasanta</i> अ being added by [[5.4.74]]. The word धूः being feminine, the whole compound would be feminine by [[2.4.26]]. The word सर्वधुरात् in the <i>sutra</i> should not be taken, therefore, as regulating the gender, for though it is in the masculine gender, the affix comes after the feminine word. In fact सर्वधुर in the <i>sutra</i> should be taken as a nominal-stem or <i>pratipadika</i> equal to सवधुरा ॥",
    "44079": "The elision is optional. Thus एकधुरां वहति = एकधुरीणः or एकधुरः ॥ The compounding is <i>taddhitartha</i> (एकां धुरं वहति) to which is added the <i>samasanta</i> अ, and then the affix ख ॥",
    "44080": "Thus शकटं वहति = शाकटः 'an ox' i. e. what bears a car. This could be evolved by तस्येदम् अण् as शाकटस्य वोढ = शाकटः ॥ The specification indicates that <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies here, as द्वे शकटे वहति = द्वैशकटः, and the affix is not elided [[4.1.88]].",
    "44081": "Thus हलं वहति = हालिकः a ploughman सैरिकः 'a plough ox.' The ठक् would have come by [[4.3.124]], the specification shows <i>tadantavidhi</i> and non-elision, as द्वैहालिकः, त्रैसीरिकः ॥",
    "44082": "Thus जनीं वहति = जन्यः 'a friend of a bridegroom,' fem. जन्याः 'a bridesmaid.' The word जनी means 'bride.' जन्या lit. means 'what bears the bride' i. e. who carries the coy bride to the bride-groom at the time of play &c.",
    "44083": "Thus पादौ विध्यन्ति = पद्याः [[6.3.53]] शर्कराः, 'what pierce the feet' i.e. pebbles. ऊरव्याः कण्टकाः 'thorns' i. e. what pierce the thigh.\n\nWhy do we say \"provided it is not a bow, अधनुषा\"? Observe पादौ विध्यति धनुषा, no affix is added here. This exclusion of धनुष् indicates that the act of piercing must be such as not to be done by a bow &c. Therefore the affix does not apply to cases like these चौरं विध्यति, शत्रुंविध्यति ॥",
    "44084": "Thus धनं लब्धा = धन्यः, so also गण्यः ॥ लब्धृ is formed from लभ् by तृन्, hence it takes the accusative.",

It describes mud which is neither very hard nor very fluid, but having sufficient consistency to take the impression of the foot. So पद्याः पांसवः 'dust' for in it also the impression of the foot can be seen. It also means 'the foot-path.' The word दृश्यम् means शक्यते द्रष्टुम् this being the force of the <i>kritya</i> affix 'ya' in दृश ॥",
    "44088": "The word आबर्हि from वृहू 'to up root,' means 'uprooting,' = उत्पाटनं ॥ मूलमेषामाबर्हि = मू꣡ल्याः 'a kind of pulse' e. g. माषा । मुद्गाः ॥ These cereals cannot be harvested without uprooting the whole plant.

The word संज्ञायां of the last <i>sutra</i> should be read into it, thus गार्हपत्यः means a particular Fire, and not every thing relating to a गृहपति ॥ The Fire in which husband (<i>grihapati</i>), together with or joined with his wife, performs sacrifice is called <i>Garhapatya</i>. That sacrifice cannot be performed in Dakshinagni. Or that fire in which <i>Grihapati</i> hymns are recited is called <i>Garhapatya</i>.",
    "44091": "The words in the above must be all in the Instrumental case in construction, for the sense of the affix shows that it should be so. Thus.\n\n1. नावा तार्यम् = नाव्यम् 'water' 'a river', lit what can be crossed by a boat.\n\n2. वयसा तुल्यः = वयस्यः 'a friend', lit. one alike in age.\n\n3. धर्मेण प्राप्यम् = धर्म्यम् 'what is attainable through <i>dharma</i>. Could not this form have been evolved by the next <i>sutra</i> धर्मादनपेते [[4.4.92]] ? No, धर्म्यम् formed by that aphorism means 'what is consistent with <i>dharma</i>' 'what is just'. The present धर्म्य refers to the 'fruit', the other to the 'act'.\n\n4. विषेण वध्यः = विष्यः 'who deserves to be put to death by poison'.\n\n5. मूलेनानाम्यम् = मूल्यम् \"price\" lit. or to be overpowered or bent by the root\". The word आनाम्य (which is formed from the root नम् 'to bow' by the affix ण्यत् contrary to rule [[3.1.98]] which reguired यत्), means अभिभवनीयम् 'what ought to be overpowered': hence मूल्यम् means 'the price, worth, cost', because articles like 'cloth' &c are produced by the out-lay of stock or capital (मूल); 'price' being a thing which, because it is capital plus profit, is superior to capital, and thus by price or <i>mulyam</i>, the capital or <i>mula</i> is overpowered.\n\n6. मूलेन समः = मूल्यः 'purchasable' lit, equivalent to capital' e.g. cloth पटः i. e. equivalent acquisition resulting from the employment of capital.\n\n7. सीतया समितं = सीत्यं 'a field'. lit. 'measured out by furrows' according to Dr Ballantyne. The word समितं is equivalent to संगतं 'united with according to <i>Kasika</i>. सीत्यं therefore literally means 'a ploughed field' i. e. 'what is united with furrows'. The affix will apply also to words ending with सीता, e.g. परमसीत्यं, उत्तमसीत्यं, द्विसीत्यं ॥\n\n8. तुलया सम्मितं = तुल्यम् \"equal\" lit. 'meted by the balance'. सम्मित means समानं, सदृशं ॥\n\nNote:- The fruits of good deeds, like happiness &c, which are attainable or <i>prapya</i> through '<i>dharma</i>', may be said also <i>dharmad</i> <i>anapetam</i> because an effect must have a cause. Hence arises the doubt as to what is the difference between this and the next <i>sutra</i>. The '<i>anapetam</i>' in the next <i>sutra</i> means tho fulfilling or following the Law established by the <i>Shishthas</i>, and has no reference to its fruits. Because the effect of <i>dharma</i> in to destroy <i>dharma</i>-- i.e. the fruits in the shape of happiness &c lessen, and ultimately extinguish the <i>dharma</i>. Therefore, the fruit of <i>dharma</i>, which is to be taken in this <i>sutra</i>, as referred to by the word <i>prapya</i>, ia diametrically opposed to the practising of <i>dharma</i>, referred to by the word <i>anapeta</i> of the next <i>sutra</i>.",
    "44092": "The ablative construction is inferred from its employment in the <i>sutra</i> itself. Thus धर्मादनपेतं = ध꣡र्म्यम् 'just' 'not deviating from merit.' Similarly प꣡थ्यम् ॥ शास्त्रीयात् पथो यदनपेतं तत् पथ्यं, न तु तस्मादनपेतश्चोरः 'wholesome diet,' अ꣡र्थ्यम् 'fit', ना꣡य्यम् 'just, suitable.' The word संज्ञायां [[4.4.89]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also, and hence the derivatives must have the above meanings.",
    "44093": "Thus छन्दसा निर्मितं = छन्दस्यः 'made at will.' The word छन्दस् is here synonymous with इच्छा 'will, wish, desire, fancy' &c, and does not mean 'metre or <i>Veda</i>.'",
    "44094": "The यत् is drawn into the <i>sutra</i> by the particle च ॥ उरसा निर्मितः = औरसं꣡ 'own son not adopted, lit. produced through the loins,' With यत् the form will be उरस्यः॑ ॥ These words denote son, and not anything produced from the loin, because the word संज्ञायां [[4.4.89]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also.",
    "44095": "The construction is shown by the aphorism itself. Thus हृदयस्य प्रियः = हृ꣡द्यः 'pleasant to the heart' e. g. हृद्यो देशः, हृद्यं वनम् ॥ But we cannot say हृद्यः पुत्रः, the word संज्ञायां [[4.4.99]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also, and thus restricts the meaning of the word.",
    "44096": "The word हृदयस्य is understood in the <i>sutra</i>. The word बन्धन gives the sense of the affix and is qualified by the word ऋषि ॥ That by which a thing is bound is called बन्धनं ॥ The word ऋषि means here the <i>Veda</i> or the Vedic bymn. Thus हृदयस्य बन्धनमृषि = हृ꣡द्यः 'the <i>Mantra</i> by which the heart of another can be brought under one's control', i.e. a वशीकरण मन्त्रः ॥",
    "44097": "Thus मतस्य करणं = म꣡त्यः 'the means of acquiring knowledge'. जनस्य जल्पः = ज꣡न्यः 'a rumour'. हलस्य कर्षः = ह꣡ल्यः 'ploughed'. So also द्विहल्यः, त्रिहल्यः, the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> applies रथसीताहलेभ्यो यद्विधौ ॥",
    "44098": "Thus सामसु साधुः = सामन्यः॑ [[6.4.168]] 'conversant with the <i>Sama</i>-<i>Veda</i>'. So also वेमन्यः, कर्मण्यः, शरन्यः &c. The word साधु here means प्रवीण, or योग्य 'expert' and 'fit', and does not mean उपकारक 'a benefactor or a good person'. When the sense is that of 'good', the <i>sutra</i> तस्मै हितम् (V. I. 5) will apply.",

    "44105": "This debars यत् the difference being in accent (III. I. 3), and (VI. I. 185) Thus सभायां साधुः = सभ्यः꣡ 'refined' lit. fit for society.",
    "44106": "This debars य ॥ Thus सभेयः in सभेयोस्य युवा यजमानस्य वीरो जायताम् 'let a refined, youthful hero be born to this sacrificer'.",
    "44107": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of साधुः now ceases. The word तीर्थ means here गुरु 'Preceptor'. Thus समाने तीर्थे वासी = सतीर्थ्यः [[6.3.87]]-- 'a fellow-student', who both dwell under the same preceptor.",
    "44108": "The word शयित is equal to स्थितः 'remain'. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = समानोदर्यः 'uterine brother' i. e. who has slept in the same womb. See [[6.3.88]].",
    "44109": "By <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.88]] समान is optionally changed to स before the word उदर when यत् follows. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = सोर्द॒॒यः꣡ ॥ Here ओ is not <i>udatta</i>, as it was in the last; the <i>udatta</i> here falls on य ॥",
    "44110": "This debars अण्, घ &c [[4.3.53]]. Those affixes also are employed in the alternative, there being much latitude of grammatical rules in the Vedas. Thus the words मेघ्यः꣡ and विदुत्य॑ in the following hymn of the <i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i> (16. V. 38): नमा॒॒ मेघ्या॑य च विदुत्या॒॒य च॒॒ ॥ All the <i>sutras</i> henceforward up to the end of the chapter, are Vedic <i>sutras</i>, the word छन्दसि being understood in them all.

    "44125": "This <i>sutra</i> requires analysis. तद्वान् is formed by adding मतुप् to तद् meaning 'having that', and refers to a noun formed by the affix मतुप् ॥ The word आसाम् is genitive plural fem. of इदं meaning 'of them'; the pronoun refers to the word इष्टका ॥ The word उपधान means 'putting up', and technically means 'used as a <i>Mantra</i> in the putting up of sacrificial bricks, pots &c'. मन्त्र \"sacred hymn\" इष्टका 'bricks'. The whole <i>sutra</i> means \"the affix '<i>yat</i>' is used with the force of a genitive (<i>asam</i>), after a word which ends with <i>matup</i> (<i>tadvan</i>), and denotes a <i>mantra</i> used in putting up of sacrificial objects; when such <i>mantra</i> refers to bricks : and when this affix <i>yat</i> is added, the affix <i>matup</i> is elided\". Thus वर्चस्वान्  is a <i>Mantra</i> containing the word वर्चस् ॥ The bricks put up or collected (उपधीयते) with the recitation of वर्चस्वान् <i>Mantra</i>, will be called वर्चस्या (वर्चस्वत् + यत् = वर्चस् + यत् the affix वत् (मतुप्) being elided = वर्चस्य, fem वर्चस्या) ॥ Thus वर्चस्या उपदधाति 'he collects <i>Varchasya</i> bricks i. e. on which <i>Varchasvan</i> <i>mantra</i> has been pronounced'. So तेजस्या उपदधाति ॥ So पयस्याः, रेतस्याः ॥\n\nWhy do we say तद्वान् ? The affix is not to be added to the whole <i>Mantra</i>. Why do we say, उपधान 'putting up'? The affix is not to be added to other <i>Mantras</i> such as those used in praying etc. e. g. वर्चस्वानुपस्थान मन्त्र आसामिष्टकानाम्, here there will be no affix. Why do we say <i>Mantra</i>?

Observe वर्चस्वानुपधानो मन्त्र एषां कपालानाम्, here there will be no affix, the thing collected being potsherds and not bricks.",
    "44126": "Thus अश्चिमानुपधानो मन्त्र आसामिष्टकानां = आश्चिनः fem. आश्चिनी ॥ The word is thus formed अश्चिमान् + अण् = अश्चि + अण् the <i>matup</i> being elided [[4.4.125]] = अश्विन् + अण् [[6.4.164]] = आश्विन ॥ Thus आश्वि꣡नीरुपदधाति 'he collects <i>Asvin</i> bricks i. e. bricks at the time of collecting which <i>Mantras</i> containing अश्विन् were uttered.

The words वयस्याः and मूर्द्धन्वत्यः denote the same object. See (VI. I. 176).\n\nWhy do we say वयस्यासु ? The affix '<i>matup</i>' will not be added to '<i>murdhan</i>', if the <i>Mantra</i> contains only the word '<i>murdhan</i>' and not '<i>vayas</i>' also. In that case मूर्धन्याः will be the form, meaning 'bricks collected with the <i>Mantra</i> containing the word मूर्धन्', while मूर्धन्वत्यः means 'bricks collected with the <i>Mantra</i> containing the words <i>murdhan</i> and <i>vayas</i>'.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> contains the word मूर्ध्नः ablative singular of मूर्धन् ॥ It ought to have been मूर्धन्वतः, for the affix <i>matup</i> is added to मूर्धन्वत्, the यत् being elided then by [[4.4.125]].

    "44128": "This debars the affix मतुप् and those having the sense of मतुप् ॥ Thus नभांसि विद्यन्ते यस्मिन् मासे = नभस्यः 'the month of clouds' i. e. June - July. So also सहस्य, तपस्यः मधव्यः, being the names of the months <i>Pausha</i> (Nov-Dec), <i>Phalguna</i> (Feb-March) and <i>Vaisakha</i> (April-May). The word मधव्यः is thus formed:- मधु + यत् = मधा + यत् [[6.4.146]] = मधव्यः [[6.1.79]] 'the month of honey'. Similarly ओजस्या तनूः 'the bodies full of vigour'.\n\nWhy do we say \"in denoting a month or a body\"?

As मध्वस्मिन्नस्ति मध्वस्मिनन्तरमिति वा = माधव्यः or माधवो मासः ॥\n\nVart:- Sometimes the affix is elided, and sometimes the letters अ, इ and र serve the same purpose as this affix. Thus तपः or तपस्यः, नभस् or नभस्यः, सहस् or सहस्यः, all in the neuter gender in the <i>Chhandas</i>. Sometimes अ serves the same purpose, e. g. इषो मासः, ऊर्जोमासः ॥ Sometimes इ, as शुचिर्मासः. Sometimes र e. g. शुक्रो मासः ॥",
    "44129": "Thus माध॑वः or मधव्यः॑ ॥ Sometimes the affix is elided, as मधुः, all these mean the month of <i>Vaisakha</i>. So also माधवाः, मधव्या and मधुः meaning तनूः a body.",
    "44130": "Thus ओजस्य॑म् or ओजसी॒॒नं = अहः 'the day' lit. full of heat.",

The word वेश means strength': भग means 'fortune, desire, effort, greatness, virility and fame.' The word वेशोभगः may be taken as a <i>Dvandva</i> compound of वेशस् 'force' and भगः 'fortune.' The word वेशोभग्यः would then mean 'possessed of power and fortune.'",
    "44132": "Thus देशोभगीनः and यशोभगीनः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> has been separated from last in order to prevent the application of the यथासंख्य rule [[1.3.10]].

Another reason for making it a distinct aphorism is that the <i>anuvritti</i> of ख runs in the next <i>sutra</i>, not so of यल् ॥",
    "44133": "The ख is read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of the word च; the <i>anuvritti</i> of मत्वर्थ ceases. Thus पूर्वैः कृतं = पूर्विणः 'made by the ancestors' i. e. a road. So also पूर्व्यः and पूर्वीणः ॥ The word पूर्वैः in the plural means पूर्वपुरुषाः \"past generations, ancestors\". These words occur generally in the plural, and mean \"roads widened by the forefathers\". Thus गम्भीरेभिः पथिभिः पूर्विणेभिः ॥ So also, ये ते पन्थाः सविताः पूर्व्यासः (<i>Rig</i> I. 35. II) Another reading of this <i>sutra</i> is पूर्वैः कृतमिनियौच; the affixes then will be इनि (इन्), and य; and ख will be drawn in by virtue of च ॥ The examples then will be पूर्विन्; 3rd pl. पूर्विभिः (with इन्), as पथिभिः पूर्विभिः, or पूर्वीणैः (ख) or पूर्व्यैः (य) ॥",

As in the following verse:- सहस्रिथासोऽपां नोर्मयः ॥ अयमग्निः सहस्रियः The word संमित means तुल्य 'equal to'. Some read the word समित instead of सम्मित, but the meaning will be the same.",
    "44136": "As सहस्रयस्य विद्यते = सहस्रियः ॥ This debars the मत्वर्थ affixes विनि and इनि and अण् of [[5.2.102]] and [[5.2.103]].",

    "44139": "Thus मधव्यान् स्तोकान् = मधुमयान् ॥",
    "44140": "Thus वसव्यः = समूहः 'a collection'.\n\nVart:- The affix '<i>yat</i>' comes without changing the sense, after the word छन्दस् when reference is made to the collection of letters. Thus the word छन्दस्यः in the following sentence: \"सप्तादशाक्षरश्छन्दस्यः प्रजापतियज्ञो मन्त्रे विहिता\". The 17 letters here referred to being ओ श्रावय, four; अस्तु श्रौषट्, four; यज, two; ये यजामहे five; and वषट् two ॥\n\nVart:- The affix यत् comes after वसु without changing the sense. As हस्तौ गृहीतस्य बहुभिर्वसव्यैः ॥ Here वसव्यैः is equal to वसुभिः ॥ Similarly अग्निरीशे वसव्यस्य = वसोः ॥",
    "44141": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of समूह does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. Thus नक्षत्रियेभ्यः स्वाहा = नक्षत्रेभ्यः स्वाहा ॥",

With a <i>krit</i>-formed word, it has accusative force, as, शिवस्य करः = शिवं करोति ॥\n\nThus शिवस्य करः = शिवतातिः, So श॑तातिः and अरिष्टतातिः ॥ As याभिः॒॒ शन्ता॑ती॒॒ भव॑थो ददा॒॒शुषे॑ (<i>Rig</i> I. 112. 20) शंताती being dual of शन्तातिः, and meaning सुखस्य कर्तारौ; so also अथो अरिष्टतातये ॥",

Thus in the <i>Sutra</i> तस्मैहितं 'suitable for that', [[5.1.5]]. the word छ must be read to complete the sense. Thus वत्सेभ्योहितो = वत्सीयो गोधुक्, करभीय उष्ट्रः, अकरभीयः, अवत्सीयः ॥ The limitation of the jurisdiction of छ has been indicated in the <i>sutra</i> with regard to the meaning of the affix, and not with regard to the affix. As an affix, छ has no force beyond <i>Sutra</i> 17, the affix ठञ् being the ruling affix thereafter.",
    "51002": "The senses of <i>Prak</i>-<i>kritiya</i> affixes are three viz, those taught in <i>sutras</i> [[5.1.5]], (V. I. 12), and [[5.1.16]]. This यत् debars छ ॥ Thus शङ्कवे हितं = शङ्क + यत् = शङ्कव्य [[6.4.146]], (VI. I. 79). As शङ्कव्यं दारु, 'wood', 'fit for a stake' पिचव्यः कार्पासः ॥ So also कमण्डलव्या मृत्तिका 'earth' lit. 'fit for a water-pot'.\n\nSo also after गवादि words, e.g. गव्यम् 'suitable for cows', हविष्यम् 'suitable for offering'.\n\nThe words सनङ्गुः meaning 'a kind of leather', and चरुः 'a kind of हविः 'offering', and सक्तुः 'a kind of food', all end in उ and are governed by this <i>sutra</i>, in spite of [[5.1.15]] which applies especially to leathers, and [[5.1.4]] and its <i>vartika</i> which applies especially to 'offerings' and 'food modifications'. This is an example where a subsequent <i>sutra</i> does not debar a prior <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.2]]. Thus सनङ्गु + यत् = सनङ्गव्यं चर्म, 'leather fit for making <i>Sanangu</i>', चरु + यत् = चरव्या स्तण्डुलाः 'rice fit for making <i>charu</i>', सक्तु + यत् = सक्तव्या धानाः 'barley' fit for making <i>Saktu</i>'.\n\nIn the list of गवादि given hereunder, occurs नाभि नभं च, which means that नाभि is replaced by नभ when the affix यत् is added. Thus नाभये हितः = नभ्यः meaning अक्षः 'axis, axle' lit. 'fitted for the nave of the wheel'; or a wood fit to be made the nave of a wheel or अञ्जनम् the grease. When the word नाभि means 'navel' of a living being, then it will not take this यत्, but it will take the यत् of [[5.1.6]]. In that case, नभ will not replace नाभि; e.g. नाभि + यत् = नाभ्यम् 'suitable for navel' i. e. oil.\n\nThe word श्वन् occurs in गवादि class. It takes <i>samprasarana</i>, व being changed to उ, and optionally this उ is lengthened; and the <i>udatta</i> accent falls on the final. As श्वन् + यत् = शुन् + यत् = शुन्य꣡म् or शुन् + यत् = शून्य꣡म् 'fit for a dog'. Contrary to [[5.4.144]], the न् of श्वन् is not elided before the <i>taddhita</i> affix वत् ॥\n\nThe word ऊधस् occurs in the गवादि class. Its final is replaced by अनङ्; e.g. ऊधस् + यत् = ऊध् + अन + य = ऊधन्यः कूपः गवादि 'a well'.\n\n1 गो, 2 हविस्, 3 अक्षर, 4 विष, 5 बर्हिस्, 6 अष्टका, 7 स्खदा (स्खद), 8 युग, 9 मेधा, 10 स्रुच् (स्रक्), 11 नाभि नभं च, 12 शुनः संप्रसारणं वा च दीर्घत्वं तत्संनियोगेन चान्तोदात्तत्वम्, 13 ऊधसोऽनङ् च, 14 कूप, 15 खद, 16 दर (उदर), 17 खर, 18 असुर, 19 अध्वन् (अध्वन; अध्वा) 20 सर, 21 वेद, 22 बीज, 23 दीप्त (दीस), 24 स्कन्द ॥",
    "51003": "This debars '<i>chha</i>'. Thus कम्बल + यत् = कम्बल्यं 'A <i>kambalya</i>-measure of wool' = 100 <i>Palas</i> of wool. This is the name of a measure, such as कम्बल्यमूर्णा पलशतम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say संज्ञायां? Observe कम्बलीया ऊर्णा \"wool\" lit. 'fit for making blanket', which is formed by छ ॥",
    "51004": "Thus आमिक्ष्यं दधि \"fit for making आमिक्षा\" i. e. curd :- or आमिक्षीयं with छ ॥ So also पुरोडाश्याः or पुरोडाशीया स्तण्डुलाः, 'suitable for making <i>Purodasa</i>' i.e. a kind of rice. The word हवि occurs in the गवादि class [[5.1.2]] and it necessarily takes यत्, there being no option. The हवि here, therefore, means things denoting sacrificial offerings, and not the word-form '<i>havi</i>.'\n\nSo also after अपूपादि, as, अपूप्यम् or अपूपीयं, तण्डुल्यम् or तण्डुलीयं ॥\n\n1 अपूप, 2 तण्डुल, 3 अभ्यूष (अभ्युष), 4 अभ्योष, 5 अवोष, 6 अभ्येष, 7 पृथुक, 8 ओदन, 9 सूप, 10 पूप, 11 किण्व, 12 प्रदीप, 13 मुसल, 14 कटक, 15 कर्णवेष्टक, 16 इर्गल, 17 अर्गल, 18 अन्नविकारेभ्यश्च, 19 यूप, 20 स्थूणा, 21 दीप (पीप), 22 अश्व, 23 पत्र, 24 कट, 25 अयः स्थूण,\n\nVart:- The affix यत् comes optionally after words denoting modifications of food: such as सक्तु ॥ In the case of '<i>saktu</i>' however, no of option is allowed. See [[5.1.2]].",
    "51005": "Thus वत्सेभ्यो हितो गोधुक् = वत्सीयः 'fit for calves' i.e. a cow-milker. So अवत्सीयः, पटव्यम्, गव्यम्, हविष्यम्, अपूप्यम्, अपूपीयम् ॥",
    "51006": "The word शरीर means animal organism. This debars छ, thus, द꣡न्त्यम् 'good for the teeth.' क꣡ण्ठ्यम्, ओ꣡ष्ठ्यम्, ना꣡भ्यम्, न꣡स्यम् such as dentrifice, snuff, oil &c. See (VI. I. 213).",
    "51007": "This debars छ. Thus ख꣡ल्यम् 'suitable for threshing floor.' So also य꣡व्यम्, मा꣡ष्यम्, ति꣡ल्यम्, वृ꣡ष्यम् and ब्रह्मण्य॑म् ॥\n\nNo secondary derivatives can, however, be formed of the following वृष्णे हितम्, ब्राह्मणेभ्यो हितम्; the full phrases must be used in these cases, for these words take neither छ nor यत् though वृष is वृषन् and ब्रह्मन् is = ब्राह्मण ॥\n\nThe word च in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the rule applies to words other than those enumerated. Thus रथाय हिता = रथ्या ॥",
    "51008": "This debars '<i>chha</i>.' Thus अजथ्या यूथिः 'the yellow jasmine called <i>yuthi</i>' अविथ्या यूथिः ॥",
    "51009": "This debars छ ॥ In the <i>sutra</i>, the न् of आत्मन् has not been elided, indicating that it should not be compounded with the word भोग which would have been the case otherwise. It therefore follows from this irregular construction of the <i>sutra</i>, that the word भोगोत्तरपद does not apply to the words आत्मन् and विश्वजन, but these words are themselves <i>prakriti</i>. Thus आत्मन् + ख = आत्मनीनम् 'suitable for ones self' the न् of <i>atman</i>, which required to be elided by [[6.4.144]], is saved by [[6.4.169]]. So also विश्वजनीनम् 'suitable for all men.' The word विश्वजन for must be a <i>karmadharaya</i> compound, meaning 'all men,' for the application of this rule; when it is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> or a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, it will take छ. As, विश्वजनाय हितं = विश्वजनीयम्, 'beneficial for man-kind.'\n\nVart:- So also after <i>Karmadharaya</i> Compound पंचजन, e.g. पंचजनीनम्, otherwise पंचजनीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- After the <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound सर्वजन, there are the affixes ठञ् and ख, as, सर्वजनीनं, and सार्वजनिकम्; otherwise सर्वजनीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ठञ् comes always after the word महाजन whether it be a <i>Karmadharaya</i> or a <i>Tatpurusha</i>, but not so when it is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> Compound. As महाजनाय हितं = माहाजनिकं ॥ In a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> it will be महाजनीयः with छ ॥\n\nCompounds having भोग as their final term, also take the affix ख, as, मातृभोगीणः and पितृभोगीणः ॥ The word भोग means 'body.' But मात्रीयः and पित्रीयः with छ, when the word भोग does not follow.\n\nVart:- The words राजा and आचार्य followed by '<i>bhoga</i>' take always the affix ख, as, राजभोगीनः and आचार्यभोगीनः ॥ In the case of आचार्यभोगीनः, the न is not changed into ण (VIII. 4. 2.) The words do not take the affix ख when used singly. As, राज्ञे हितम्, आचार्याय हितम्, no affix being employed.",
    "51010": "This debars '<i>chha</i>'. Thus सर्वस्मै हितं = सार्वम्. So also पौरुषेयम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes optionally after सर्व, as, सर्वीयम् or सार्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ढञ् comes after पुरुष when the word so formed means: 'slaughter', 'modification', 'a crowd', or 'made by him'. As पौरुषेयो वधः &c. 'man-slaughter', 'a crowd of men', 'human action', 'made by man'. e.g. पौरुषेयो ग्रन्थः 'a book written by man' contra. अपौरुषेया वेदाः 'The Vedas are non-human'.",
    "51011": "This debars छ. As माणवाय हितं = माणवीनम्. So also चारकीणम् ॥",
    "51012": "The word प्रकृति means 'primitive or the material cause of a product', The word विकृति means 'the product' or 'modification of such primitive' तदर्थे 'serviceable for that' i. e. 'the primitive being serviceable for the product'. The word तदर्थे shows that the primitive must be serviceable for that particular product and nothing else. That is to say, an affix will not come to denote any product in general, but only when the primitive is serviceable for a particular product and nothing else. The word तदर्थ shows also that the word must be in the 4th case, when the affix is added. Some read the words तस्मै हितं also into this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThus अङ्गारेभ्यो हितानि एतानि काष्ठानि = अङ्गारीयाणि काष्ठानि 'wood serviceable for making charcoal;' so also प्राकारीया इष्टकाः 'bricks serviceable for making a wall'. Here अङ्गारीय and प्राकारीय are formed by छ (V. I. 1). Similarly शङ्कव्यं दारु 'wood serviceable for a spear.', पिचव्यः कार्पासः 'cotton plant serviceable for cotton'.\n\nWhy do we say तदर्थम् 'serviceable thereto'? Observe यवानां धानाः, धानानां सक्तवः ॥ Here there is modification of primitive, but सक्तु is the product also of other things than धानाः such as लाजा &c.\n\nWhy do we say विकृतेः 'after a product'? Observe उदकार्थः कूपः, there is no affix. For कूपः 'a well' and उदक 'water' do not stand in the relation of and प्रकृति and विकृति i.e. material cause and effect. As 'water' is not the modification or product of 'the well, though it is found in the well, and therefore, the affix is not employed.\n\nWhy do we say प्रकृतौ 'to denote a primitive'. Observe अस्यर्था कोशी 'a sheath serviceable for a sword'. The sword is a product of iron, but a sheath is not the primitive of the sword. \n\nBy using the words प्रकृति and विकृति it is further shown that the <i>prakriti</i> is liable to modification or <i>vikara</i>.",
    "51013": "This debars छ. Thus छादिषेयाणि तृणानि, औषधेयं दारु, बालेयास्तण्डुलाः ॥\n\nThe affix comes after the word उपाधि without changing the sense. उपधीयत इत्युपधिः = रथांगम् 'part of a wheel between the nave and the circumference or the wheel istelf'. The word औषधेय also means the same.",
    "51014": "Thus आर्षभ्यो वत्सः, औपानह्योः मुञ्जः ॥ This '<i>nya</i>' debars '<i>chha</i>'. Even when the primitive is 'leather चर्म', the affix '<i>nya</i>' will come after उपानह् irregularly debarring अञ् of [[5.1.15]]. Thus औपानह्यं चर्म ॥",
    "51015": "The word चर्मणः in the aphorism is in the genitive case. This अञ् debars छ. Thus वार्द्ध्रं चर्म and वारत्रं चर्म a leather serviceable for making a '<i>vardhra</i>' and '<i>varata</i>' i.e. a leather thong.",
    "51016": "The word तद् shows that the word in construction must be in the Ist case, the words अस्य 'of it' and अस्मिन् 'in it' show the senses of the affix, the word स्यात् 'it can be' qualifies the primitive, the word इति is for the sake of distinctness. Thus प्राकार आसाम् इष्टकानां स्यात् = प्राकारीया इष्टकाः 'the bricks sufficient to raise a wall'. So also प्रासादीयं दारु ॥ Similarly प्राकारोऽस्मिन्देशे स्यात् = प्राकारीयो देशः 'a place sufficient to make a wall therein'. प्रासादीया भूमिः ॥\n\nThe word स्यात् being in the Potential Mood (विधि लिङ्) of अस् 'to be,' has the force of संभावन 'potentiality, sufficiency' as given in <i>Sutras</i> [[3.3.154]] &c. Such as when the large number of bricks makes it possible to raise a wall, we say प्राकार यासामिष्टकानां स्यात् ॥ Similarly when the quality (गुण) of a land, such as its area, situation &c, makes it possible to erect a palace therein, we say, प्रासादो स्मिन्देशे स्यात् ॥\n\nIn the examples under this <i>sutra</i>, there is no modification (विकार) of the primitive (प्रकृति) into a product, as was the case under <i>sutra</i> [[5.1.12]]. The examples under this <i>sutra</i> show merely the 'adequacy, fitness or sufficiency' of a thing for a certain purpose. Herein lies the difference between this <i>sutra</i> and the previous ones.  \n\nThe repetition of the word तद् twice in this <i>sutra</i> shows the existence of this Grammatical maxim: अनेकस्मिन् प्रत्ययार्थे प्रत्येकं समर्थ विभक्तिः संबन्धनीयः 'when the sense of an affix is more than one, the case in construction to which the affix must be added must be shown in each case.'\n\nWhy there is no affixing in this case: प्रासादो देवदत्तस्य स्यात् ? The use of इति in the <i>Sutra</i> would prevent this, the force of इति being that the secular usage must be looked to in forming these derivatives.",
    "51017": "This debars छ. Thus पारिखेयी भूमिः 'land sufficient to make a mote thereon'.\n\nUp to this <i>Sutra</i> was the governing force of the affixes छ and यत् ॥ Hereafter another affix will be taught.",
    "51018": "The affix ठञ् governs all the succeeding <i>sutras</i> upto तेन त्य्ल्यं क्रिय चेद्वात, and has the senses given to it in <i>Sutras</i> [[5.1.37]] &c. Strictly speaking the affix ठञ् governs only upto [[5.1.110]] and not upto [[5.1.115]]. Thus in <i>Sutra</i> [[5.1.72]], the affix ठञ् must be read as पारायणिकः, तौरायणिकः, चान्द्रायणिकः ॥",
    "51019": "<i>Karika</i>\n\nऊर्ध्वमानं किलोन्मानं परिमाणं तु सर्वतः ।\nआयामस्तु प्रमाणं स्यात्संख्या बाह्या तु सर्वतः ॥\n\nStrictly speaking ठक् governs upto <i>sutra</i> [[5.1.65]]. The word आर्हाद् is made up of आ + अर्हात् The force of आ here is अभिविधि or inclusive, so that in the <i>Sutra</i> तदर्हति [[5.1.63]] also, the ठक् will be employed. The affix ठक् debars ठञ् ॥ The sense will be the same as given in [[5.1.37]] &c. the difference between ठक् and ठञ् being in accent only. Thus निष्कया क्रीतं = नैष्किकम्, So also पाणिकम् ॥\n\nBut गोपुच्छेन क्रीतम् = गोपुच्छिकम्, the accent falling on गौ; so also with words denoting Numbers and Measures, as षाष्टिकम्, प्रास्थिकम्, कौडविकम् ॥\n\nThe word परिमाण in this <i>sutra</i> has its technical signification, and not its etymological sense. Technically परिमाण does not include संख्या, etymologically it does. <i>Panini</i> has used this word परिमाण  in some <i>sutras</i> in its technical sense, in others in its etymological sense. Thus in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.22]], and [[5.1.19]] the technical sense is taken, while in <i>sutras</i> [[4.3.156]] and [[5.1.57]] the etymological sense is meant. Technically परिमाण means सर्वतो मानं or a measure of capacity, and surface namely length and breadth and height or depth, such as प्रस्थः &c, i.e. a cubic measure and a square measure. In this sense it is to be distinguished from the measures of length or lineal measure, technically called प्रमाण, such as a वितस्त्य 'a cubit' &c, on the one side, and the measures of weight, technically called उन्माण such as पल, &c on the other side. In short उन्मान means a measure of weight or gravity, परिमाण means a measure of volume or capacity, प्रमाण means a lineal measure, and a संख्या is beyond all these.",
    "51020": "The word आर्हात् is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also. This ठक् debars ठञ्. Thus नैष्किक꣡म्, पाणिक꣡म्, पादिक꣡म्, माषिक꣡म् ॥\n\nWhy do we say असमासे 'when not compounds'? Observe प꣡रमनैष्किकम् उ꣡त्तमनैष्किकम् formed by ठञ् (V. I. 18.) Compare [[7.3.17]] by which the <i>Vriddhi</i> of the second term takes place and not of the first.\n\nQ. Is not the employment of the word असमासे in the <i>Sutra</i> redundant? For by the maxim ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>pratipadika</i>, does, contrary to [[1.1.72]], not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself;\" the <i>pratipadika</i> निष्क being especially mentioned in the <i>sutra</i>, the rule will apply to the word निष्क and not to a word ending with निष्क ॥\n\nA. The employment of the word असमासे in this <i>Sutra</i>, indicates by implication <i>jnapaka</i>), that in spite of the above maxim, the तदन्तविधिः [[1.1.72]] applies in the previous <i>sutras</i>, while in the subsequent <i>sutras</i> its does not. As उगवादिभ्यो यत् [[5.1.2]], the यत् applies not only to गो &c but to words ending in गो &c. As गव्यम् and सुगव्यम्, अतिसुगव्यम् ॥ Not only अपूप्यम् अपूपीयम् (V. I. 4.) but also यवापूप्यम्, यवापूपीयम् ॥ Not only दन्त्यम् (V. 1. 6.) but also राजदन्त्यम् ॥\n\nWhile in the <i>sutras</i> subsequent to this [[5.1.20]], the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies only to words preceded by a <i>Sankhya</i> and that also in <i>Sutras</i> upto [[5.1.115]] and not there after as, द्वैपारायणिकः and त्रैपारायणिक [[5.1.72]]. Even in this latter case, when an affix is elided by लुक् the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> does not apply. Thus द्वाभ्यां शूर्पाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्वि शूर्प + ठञ् (V. I 18) = द्विशूर्पम्, the affix being elided by [[5.1.28]]. Now in forming a tertiary derivative from this word द्विशूर्पम्, the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> will not apply. Thus द्विशूर्पेण क्रीतं, here what affix are we to subjoin? If <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> applied, we get the affix अञ् [[5.1.26]] in the alternative. But <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> not applying, we get the general affix ठञ् [[5.1.8]] and have द्विशौर्पिकम् ॥ Here the affix ठञ् is not elided by [[5.1.28]], as there is no <i>Dvigu</i> compounding. The above rule is summarised in the following <i>ishti</i> प्राग्वतेः संख्यापूर्वपदानां तदन्तग्रहणमलुकि ॥\n\nThe words 1. निष्क, 2. पण, 3. माष, 4. वाहद्रोण and 5. षष्टि belong to निष्कादि class.",
    "51021": "The word आर्हात् [[5.1.19]] is understood here also. These affixes ठन् and यत् debar the affix कन् [[5.1.22]]. Thus शतेन क्रीतम् = शत्यम् or शतिकम् 'purchased for a hundred gold coins'.\n\nWhy do we say अशते when not meaning 'merely a hundred'? Observe शतं परिमाणमस्य = शतकं निदानम् 'a band whose measure is hundred'. The word अशते qualifies the sense of the affix, and not that of the base, the latter not being possible; for the word शत as a base must always mean 'a hundred'. The following examples will illustrate the meaning; शतमध्यायाः परिमाणमस्य ग्रन्थस्य = शतकः 'a book consisting of hundred <i>Adhyayas</i>'. In this case there is essentially no difference between the base (<i>prakriti</i>) and the sense of the affix (<i>pratyayartha</i>), though there is apparent difference, for the sake of applying the affix. For शतकः is a book essentially consisting of hundred: while शत्यं 'a carriage purchased for a hundred coins', does not contain hundred as its essential part. Similarly शतको गोसंघः 'a herd of cows hundred in number'. Here the संघः essentially consists of शत and so there is the affix कन् and not ठन् or यत् [[5.1.58]]. But not so in the case of शत्यं शाटकशतं, शतिकं शाटकशतं, for here the sense of the affix is formed by the sentence, and not discovered merely from the word. Hence the following <i>Vartika</i> शतप्रतिषेधेऽन्यशतत्वेऽप्रतिषेधः ।\n\nThe word च in the <i>sutra</i> draws in the word असमासे from the previous <i>sutra</i>. Thus द्वौ च शतं च = द्विशतं, द्विशतेन क्रीतं = द्विशतकम् 'purchased for a hundred and two coins'. Here the affix is कन् [[5.1.22]]. So त्रिशतकम् ॥ According to the <i>Ishti</i> given in the last <i>Sutra</i>, the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> applies here.",
    "51022": "The word आर्हात् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> also. The word संख्या is defined in (l. 1. 23). This कन् debars ठञ् ॥ Thus पंचभिः क्रीतः = पंचकः, बहुकः, गणकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not end in ति or शत्'? Observe सा꣡प्ततिकः चा꣡त्वारिशतकः formed by ठञ् ॥ But why कतिकः is formed by कन् and not by ठञ् or ठक्, as the word कति also ends in ति? The word कति is formed by adding the affix डति, while the rule applies to the numerals which in their primitive state end with ति such as सप्ततिः, अशीतिः, विंशति &c. Here apply the two maxims अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य 'a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning;' and निरनुबन्धक ग्रहणे न सानुबन्धकस्य 'when a term void of <i>Anubandhas</i> is employed in Grammar, it does not denote that which has an <i>Anubandha</i> attached to it'. Therefore when ति is taken, it does not mean डति॥",
    "51023": "The words ending in वत् are संख्या; see [[1.1.23]]: and would consequently take कन् by [[5.1.22]]. The present <i>sutra</i> ordains the optional affixing of इट् to this कन् ॥ Thus तावत्कः or तावतिकः, यावतिकः or यावत्कः ॥",
    "51024": "Thus विंशति + ड्वुन् = विंश + अक [[6.4.142]] = विंशक; त्रिंशत् + ड्वुन् = त्रिंश् + अक [[6.4.143]] = त्रिंशकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say असंज्ञायाम् 'when not denoting a Name'? Observe, विंशतिकः, त्रिंशत्कः formed by affix कन् [[5.1.22]]. Q. Why do you affix कन्, when it is prohibited by the phrase अतिशदन्तायाः; for विंशति ends in ति and त्रीशत् ends in शत् ? The affix कन् will be added by dividing the <i>sutra</i> into two: viz: (1) विंशतित्रिंशद्भ्यां (2) ड्वुनसंज्ञायाम्; the meanings being (1) The affix '<i>Kan</i>' is added to <i>vinsati</i> and <i>trinsat</i>; (2) The affix <i>dvun</i> is added to the same words, when not denoting a name.",
    "51025": "This debars ठञ्; the <i>anubandha</i> टि of टिठन् shows that the feminine of the word will be formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]], the इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the न् of टिठन् is for accent [[6.1.197]]. Thus कंसिकः fem. कंसिकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also it must be stated after the word अर्ध; e. g. अर्द्धिकः, अर्धिकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word कार्षापण, e. g. कार्षापणिकः fem. कार्षापणिकी ॥ Sometimes the word प्रति is substituted for कार्षापण before this affix, as, प्रतिकः fem. प्रतिकी ॥",

But in forming tertiary derivatives the affix is not elided, as द्विशूर्पेण क्रीतं = द्विशौर्पिकम् ॥ Hence the following rule: द्विगोर्लुकि तन्निमित्तग्रहणम् ॥ See [[4.1.88]], (V. 1. 20.) ॥\n\nWhy do we say असंज्ञायाम् 'when not a Name'? Observe पांचलोहितिकम् or पंचलौहितिकम् and पांचकलायिकम् being names of certain measures. The feminine word लोहिनी is changed into the masculine by the <i>Vartika</i> भस्याढे तद्धिते given under [[6.3.35]].\n\nThe word अध्यर्द्ध is a <i>Sankhya</i> (See [[1.1.23]]), and a word beginning with it will be a <i>Dvigu</i> compound. Its separate mention in this <i>sutra</i> may appear superfluous. It is however so mentioned, in order to indicate (<i>jnapaka</i>) that this word is not always a <i>Sankhya</i>. Thus for the purposes of the application of the affix कृत्वसूच् [[5.4.17]], this word is not a <i>sankhya</i>.",
    "51029": "This <i>sutra</i> makes the elision optional, when it was compulsory by the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus अध्यर्द्धकार्षापणम् or अध्यर्द्धकार्षापणिकं, द्विकार्षापणम् or द्विकार्षापणिकम्, here the affix टिठन् [[5.1.25]] is elided in one case, and not elided in the other. When it is not elided, प्रति may be substituted for कार्षापण (V. I. 25). अध्यर्द्धप्रतिकम्, द्विप्रतिकम् ॥\n\nSo also after the word सहस्र, e.g. अध्यर्द्धसहस्रम् or अध्यर्द्धसाहस्रम्, द्विसहस्रम् or द्विसाहस्रम् ॥ When the affix is not elided, the forms above shown with irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of the second stem, are evolved by <i>sutra</i> (VII. 3. I5).\n\nVart:- The words सुवर्ण and शतमान should also be enumerated. As, अध्यर्द्धसुवर्णम् or अध्यर्द्धसौवर्णिकम्, द्विसुवर्णम्, द्विसौवर्णिकम्, अध्यर्द्धशतमानम्, अध्यर्द्धशातमानम्, द्विशतमानम् or द्विशातमानम् ॥ The irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of the second term takes place by [[7.3.17]].",
    "51030": "The word द्विगोः 'a <i>taddhita</i> occasioning a <i>Dvigu</i> compound' of (V. I. 28) is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus द्विनिष्कम् or द्विनैष्किकम्, त्रिनिष्कम् or त्रिनैष्किकम् [[7.3.17]].\n\nVart:- So also when <i>nishka</i> is preceded by बहु e.g. बहुनिष्कम् or बहुनैष्किकम् ॥ The irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of the second term is caused by [[7.3.17]].",
    "51031": "The word च in the <i>sutra</i> draws in the words द्वित्रिपूर्वात् ॥ Thus द्विबिस्तम् or द्विबैस्तिकम्, त्रिबिस्तम् or त्रिबैस्तिकम्, बहुबिस्तम्, बहुबैस्तिकम् ॥\n\nThe separation of this <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>.",
    "51032": "Thus अध्यर्द्धविंशतिकीनम्, द्विविंशतिकीनम् and त्रिविंशतिकीनम् ॥ Being especially ordained, this affix ख is not elided by [[5.1.28]].",
    "51033": "Thus अध्यर्द्धखारीकम्, द्विखारीकम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word खारी alone, as खारीकम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word काकिणी, as, अध्यर्द्धकाकिणीकम्, द्विकाकिणीकम्, त्रिकाकिणीकम् ॥ So also when the word is alone: as, काकिणीकम् ॥",
    "51034": "Thus अध्यर्द्धपण्यम्, द्विपण्यम्, त्रिपण्यम् so also अध्यर्द्धपाद्यम्, द्विपाद्यम्, त्रिपाद्यम् ॥ Here पाद is not changed into पद, by [[6.3.53]]. The substitution enjoined by [[6.3.53]] takes place when पाद means the foot of a living being, while here it means a measure of capacity. So also अध्यर्द्धमाष्यम्, द्विमाष्यम्, त्रिमाष्यम्, अध्यर्द्धशत्यम्, द्विशत्यम्, त्रिशत्यम् ॥",
    "51035": "This debars ठञ् which also comes in the alternative, and is then elided by (V. I. 28). Thus अध्यर्द्धशाण्यम् or अध्यर्द्धशाणम्, द्विशाण्यम् or द्विशाणम्, त्रिशाण्यम् or त्रिशाणम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also optionally after the word शत, as, अध्यर्द्धशत्यम् or शतम्, द्विशत्यम् or शतम्, त्रिशत्यम् or शतम् ॥",
    "51036": "The यत् comes optionally by the last <i>sutra</i> and is also drawn into this by the word च. Thus we have three forms, द्विशाण्यम्, द्वैशाणम्, and द्विशाणम्, so also त्रिशाण्यम्, त्रैशाणम् and त्रिशाणम् ॥\n5.1.37.md''\nThe irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of the second term in cases of compounds of numerals, taught in [[7.3.15]] - [[7.3.17]], does not however take place in the case of शाण, this word being especially excluded from the operation of those rules, see [[7.3.17]]. The <i>Vriddhi</i> here is regular as taught by the general rule [[7.2.117]].",
    "51037": "The thirteen affixes ठञ्, ठक्, ठन्, यत्, कन्, ड्वुन्, टिठन्, अञ्, अण्, ख, ईकन्, यत् and अण् have already been taught. Now is taught their sense, and the case in construction of the word to which they should be added. The तेन shows that the word must be in the 3rd case in construction : and क्रीतम् shows that the sense is that of 'purchased'. The illustrations have already been given in the previous <i>sutras</i>. Some more may be mentioned here. Thus सप्तत्याक्रीतं = साप्ततिकम्, आशीतिकम्, नैष्किकम्, पाणिकम्, पादिकम्, माषिकम्, शत्यम्, शतिकम्, द्विकम्, त्रिकम् &c.\n\nThe affix will come after a word in the 3rd case in construction when it means 'price,' and the force of the 3rd case is that of 'instrument' [[2.3.18]] and not that of 'agent.' Therefore, there is no affixing in the words देवदत्तेन क्रीतं or पाणिना क्रीतं ॥\n\nNor does the affix come after a dual or a plural. Thus प्रस्थाभ्यां क्रीतं or प्रस्थैः क्रीतं, there is no affixing, as it is not the idiom. But द्वाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्विकम्, त्रिकम्, पंचकम्, मुद्गैः क्रीतं = मौद्गिकम्, माषिकम्. Here there is affixing after a dual and plural, for the words द्वि, त्रि are essentially dual or plural, and in the case of मुद्गः and माषः, those are always used in the plural, for it is not possible to purchase anything with a single grain of मुद्ग or माषः ॥",
    "51038": "The word तस्य shows that the word in construction must be in the 6th case, the word निमित्तं 'cause or occasion' gives the sense of the affix; संयोग means 'a connection, or relation': उत्पातः means 'a portend indicative of good or bad luck.' Thus शतस्य निमित्तं धनपतिना संयोगः = शत्यः 'a connection with a rich man for the sake of getting a hundred.' So also शतिकः, साहस्रः ॥ So also शतस्य निमित्तमुत्पातो दक्षिणाक्षिस्पन्दनम् = शत्यम्, शतिकम्, साहस्रम् \"the twitching of the right eye for the sake of a hundred\" i. e. indicative of acquiring or losing a hundred, a thousand &c.\n\nVart:- The above affixes come after the words वात, पित्तं, and श्लेष्म in the senses of allaying or vitiating. As वातिकम् 'allaying or vitiation of windy humour.' So also पैत्तिकम्, श्लेष्मिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- Also after the word सन्निपात, as, सान्निपातिकम् ॥",
    "51039": "This debars ठञ्. As गो निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = ग꣡व्यः 'a connection or a portent for the sake of a cow.' So also after a word of two syllables, as, ध꣡न्यम्, स्व꣡र्ग्यम्, यशस्य॑म्, आयुष्य॑म् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not a word denoting a Numeral, or a Measure of capacity or अश्व &c\"? Observe पंचानां निमित्तं = पंचकम्, सप्तकम्, अष्टकम्; प्रास्थिकम् खारीकम्, आश्विकः formed by (V. I. 22), (V. I. 18), (V. I. 19).\n\nVart:- The word ब्रह्मवर्च्चस should be enumerated : eg. ब्रह्मवर्च्चसस्य निमित्तं गुरुणा संयोगः = ब्रह्मवर्च्चस्यम् \"relationship with a teacher in order to acquire <i>Brahmavarchasa</i>.\"\n\n1 अश्व, 2 अश्मन्, 3 गण, 4 ऊर्णा, 5 उमा, 6 गङ्गा (भङ्ग भङ्गा), 7 वर्षा (वर्ष), 8 वसु. ॥",
    "51040": "The word पुत्र being a dissyllabic word would always have taken यत् by the last aphorism. This ordains छ also. Thus पुत्रस्य निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = पुत्रीयम् or पुत्र्यम् ॥",
    "51041": "This debars ठक्. Thus सर्वभूमेर्निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = सार्वभौमः, so also पार्थिवः ॥ In सार्वभौमः there is <i>Vriddhi</i> of both members of the compound by [[7.3.20]].",
    "51042": "Thus सर्वभूमेरीश्वरः = सार्वभौमः 'the lord of the whole earth', पार्थिवः 'the lord of the earth'.\n\nThe word तस्य, showing the genitive construction of the base, has been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was running into it from [[5.1.38]]; in order to show that the senses given in [[5.1.38]] do not extend further. Had तस्य not been repeated here, the word ईश्वरः would have been an attribute, like the words संयोग and उत्पात, of the word निमित्तः ॥",
    "51043": "The word विदितः means known published &c. सर्वभूमौ विदितः = सार्वभौमः known in the whole world. So also पार्थिवः ॥",
    "51044": "Thus लोके विदितः = लौकिकः, सार्वलौकिकः ॥ The irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of both members takes place by [[7.3.20]].",
    "51045": "The word वापः means 'sown therein' i. e. a field. Thus प्रस्थस्य वापः क्षेत्रं = प्रास्थिकम् 'sown with a <i>Prastha</i>', द्रौणिकम्, खारीकम्, i. e a field sown with a quantity of grain measuring a <i>Prastha</i> or a <i>Drona</i> or a <i>Khari</i>.",
    "51046": "This debars ठञ्. The न् of ष्ठन् is for accent [[6.1.197]], the ष् is for ङीष् [[4.1.41]]. The word पात्र denotes a measure of capacity. Thus पात्रस्य वापः = पा꣡त्रिकं क्षेत्रम्, fem पात्रिकी꣡ क्षेत्रभक्तिः ॥",
    "51047": "The affix is added to a word in the first case (तद्) in construction. The sense of the affix is that of a locative (अस्मिन्). The word दीयते 'is given' in the singular number joins with each one of the word वृद्धि, आय &c. The sum paid by a debtor to his creditor over and above the principal, is called वृद्धि or interest. The share of profit taken by landlord in villages &c. is called आय or rent. The increase over the capital by sale of cloth &c. is called लाभ or profit. The share of the king for protection &c. is called शुल्क or tax. The present or bribe is called उपदा ॥ Thus पंचास्मिन् वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा शुल्को वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचकः 'that transaction &c. in which five percent is given as interest, rent, profit tax or bribe'. Similarly सप्तकः, शत्यः, शतिकः, साहस्रः &c.\n\nVart:- So also in the sense of a Dative. As पंचास्मै वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचको देवदत्तः \"<i>Devadatta</i> to whom five percent is given as Interest &c\". This <i>Vartika</i> may be redundant, if we take the locative as sometimes having the force of dative also. As in the sentence सममब्राह्मणे दानं ॥",
    "51048": "This debars ठक् and टिठन् ॥ Thus द्वितीयो वृद्ध्यादिरस्मिन् दीयते = द्वितीयिकः, तृतीयिकः, पंचमिकः, सप्तमिकः, अर्द्धिकः ॥ The word अर्द्ध is technically the name of रूपकार्ध ।",
    "51049": "By the word च in the <i>sutra</i>  ठन् also comes. This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus भागो वृद्ध्यादिरस्मिन् दीयते = भाग्यं or भागिकं शतम्; भाग्या or भागिका विंशतिः ॥ The word भाग also denotes रूपकार्ध ॥",
    "51050": "The case in construction here is accusative (तद्). Thus, वंशभारं हरति, वहति आवहति वा = वांशभारिकः, कौटजभारिकः, बाल्वजभारिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after भार\"? Observe वंशं हरति, no affixing. Why do we say \"preceded by वंश &c\". Observe व्रीहिभारं हरति, no affixing.\n\nAccording to another explanation, the phrase भाराद् वंशादिभ्यः is explained as भारभूतेभ्यो वंशादिभ्यः. Then the <i>sutra</i> will mean \"the above named affixes come after वंश &c. when they denote a load\". Thus भारभूतान् वंशान् हरति = वांशिकः; कौटजिकः, बाल्वजिकः ॥ Why do we say \"when denoting a load भार\"? Observe वंशं हरति ॥ Why do we say after वंश &c.? Observe भारभूतान् व्रीहीन् वहति ॥ Both these explanations are valid and traditional.\n\nThe word हरति means to carry to another place or to steal; वहति means to carry on ones back or head, आवहति means to produce or bring.\n\n1 वंश, 2 कुटज, 3 बल्वज, 4 मूल, 5 स्थुणा, (स्थुण), 6 अक्ष, 7 अश्मन्, 8 अश्व, 9 लक्षण, 10 इक्षु, 11 खट्वा ॥",
    "51051": "Thus वस्नं हरति वहति वा = वस्निकः, द्रव्यकः ॥",
    "51052": "The word तद् is understood here, showing that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the accusative. The word संभव means the capacity to hold the exact quantity; अवहार means 'taking away, or containing.' Thus प्रस्थं संभवति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel capable of holding a <i>Prastha</i> measure.' So प्रस्थमवहरति or पचति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel or a person that takes away, holds or cooks a <i>Prastha</i> measure.' Similarly क्रौडविकः and खारीकः ॥ The word संभव does not govern the word पचति, thus प्रस्थं पचति ब्राह्मणी = प्रास्थिकी <i>Brahmana</i> who cooks a <i>Prastha</i>'.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् also comes after the word द्रोण in the sense of 'who cooks that' e.g. द्रोणं पचति ब्राह्मणी = द्रौणी or द्रौणिकी ॥",
    "51053": "This ख debars ठञ् which comes in the alternative. Thus आढकं संभवति, अवहरति, पचति वा = आढकीना or आढकिकी, आचितीना or आचितिकी, पात्रीणा or पात्रिकी ॥",
    "51054": "The ख is read into the <i>sutra</i> by the word च of the aphorism. These two affixes ख and ष्ठन् being especially ordained, are not to be elided by [[5.1.28]]. But when in the alternative, we add the general affix ठञ्, then it is elided by [[5.1.28]]. The न् of ष्ठन् is for accent [[6.1.19]]. and the ष् for ङीष् ॥ Thus we have 3 forms:- द्व्याढकिकी, द्व्याढकीना, or द्व्याढकी; द्व्याचितिकी, द्व्याचितीना, द्व्याचिता. In this case of द्व्याचिता the feminine is not formed by ङीप् [[4.1.21]] because of the specific prohibition contained in [[4.1.22]]. So also द्विपात्रिकी, द्विपात्रीणा and द्विपात्री ॥",
    "51055": "By च the affix ष्ठन् is also added. The elision being optional, the affix ठञ् (V. I. 18) may optionally be elided by [[5.1.28]]. Thus we get four forms: द्विकुलिजिकी (ष्ठन्), द्विकुलिजीना (ख), द्विकुलिजा (ठञ् लुक्), द्वैकुलिजिकी (ठञ्) ॥ In the last example, there is not <i>vriddhi</i> of the second term, though it was so required by [[7.3.17]]. The anomaly is explained by holding that the word कुलिज should be included in the exception along with संज्ञा and शाण of [[7.3.17]].",
    "51056": "The सः shows that the case in construction is nominative. The word अंश means 'share,' वस्न means 'price,' भृति means 'wages.' Thus पंच अंशो वस्नो वा भृतिर्वास्य = पंचक 'whose portion, price or pay is five.' So सप्तकः, साहस्रः ॥",
    "51057": "The word तद् shows that the word in construction should be in the nominative case. Thus प्रस्थः परिमाणमस्य = प्रास्थिको राशिः 'a heap whose mass is a <i>Prastha</i>.' So also खारीकः, शत्यः, शतिकः, साहस्रः, द्रौणिकः, कौडविकः, वार्षशतिकः, वार्षसहस्रिकः ॥ So also षष्ठिर्जीवित परिमाणमस्य षाष्ठिकः, द्विसाप्ततिकः ॥\n\nWhy the words तदस्य have been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, when their <i>anuvritti</i> could have been drawn from the last aphorism, the word सोऽस्य and तदस्य being the same? The repetition shows that the affixes are again ordained, so that the elision taught in [[5.1.28]] does not apply. Thus द्वे षष्ठी परिमाणमस्य = द्विषाष्ठकः, द्विसाप्ततिकः, ॥ Here the affix is not elided by [[5.1.28]].",
    "51058": "The phrase तदस्य परिमाणं is understood here. The word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case. When it is a Name, the affix does not change the sense of the radical. Thus पंचकाः = पंचः 'the Five' as पंचका शकुनयः, त्रिकाः 'the Three' = शालङ्कायनाः ॥ The sense of the primitive is changed when it means संघ 'a multitude or flock'; as पंचकः संघः, अष्टकः ॥ So also when it means a सूत्र 'a Book', as, अष्टावध्यायाः परिमाणमस्य सूत्रस्य = अष्टकं पाणिनीयम् 'The <i>Ashtaka</i> of <i>Panini</i> viz, a Book comprising Eight <i>Adhyayas</i>'. So also वैयाघ्रपदीयम्, त्रिकं काशकृत्स्नम् ॥ Is not a collection of <i>Adhyayas</i> the same as संघः ? No, the word संघः is confined to a collection of living beings only.\n\nThe word अध्ययन means 'study'. Its numerical measure (संख्या परिमाण) means the particular number of times, or ways in which it should be read. Thus पंचकोऽधीतः 'what is studied five-times or in five modes' सप्तकोऽधीतः so also अष्टकः or नवकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ड comes after the words पंचदश &c, when the word means a <i>Stoma</i>. As, पंचदश मन्त्राः परिमाणमस्य = पंचदशः स्तोमः, सप्तदशः स्तोमः &c. The indicatory ड् causes the elision of final (टि) by [[6.4.143]], in the cases of words like एकविंशः &c. In the case of पंचदशः the न् is elided by [[6.4.141]].\n\nVart:- The affix डिनि comes in the <i>Chhandas</i> after words ending in शत् and शन्, as, पंचदशिनोर्द्धमासाः, त्रिंशिनो मासाः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word विंशति, as विंशिनोऽङ्गिरसः ॥",
    "51059": "The words तदस्य परिमाणम् are understood here also : पंक्ति is formed by adding ति to पंच, the final being elided, meaning 'a verse the measure of which is five', i. e. a half-quarter consisting of 5 syllables. The word विंशति is formed by adding शतिच् to the word विन् which replaces the two word द्वयोदशतः as द्वौ दशतौ परिमाणमस्य संघस्य = विंशतिः ॥ So the affix शत् comes after त्रिन् representing त्रयोदशतः; so for चतुर्णो दशतां we have चत्वारिम् and then add शत्, similarly with पंचाशत् ॥ Similarly with the rest.\n\nNote:- All the rest appears to be the conjectural etymology of <i>Patanjali</i> and <i>Kasikakara</i>, and hence it is omitted.\n\nThe word पंक्ति also means 'a line'. As ब्राह्मणपङ्क्तिः, पिपीलिका पंक्तिः ॥ Here the sense has no relation to its etymology.",
    "51060": "This ordains डति instead of कन् [[5.1.22]], which also comes in the alternative. As पंचद्वर्गः, दशद्वर्गः or पंचकोवर्गः, दशकोवर्ग ॥",
    "51061": "As सप्त साप्तान्यसृजन् ॥ The phrase तदस्य परिमाणं is understood here.",
    "51062": "The word वर्ग does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. The indicatory ड् causes the elision of the last vowel with the consonant that follows it [[6.4.143]]. The force of the locative case in ब्राह्मणे is that of अभिधेय and not विषय, i. e. when the word means a <i>Brahmana</i> itself. Had the force been that of विषय, it would have meant, 'in the <i>Brahmana</i> literature'. As त्रिंशदध्यायाः परिमाणमेषां ब्राह्मणानां = त्रैंशानि ब्राह्मणानि 'The <i>Brahmana</i> containing thirty <i>Adhyayas</i>'. So चत्वारिंशानि ब्राह्मणानि ॥ These being the names of certain <i>Brahmanas</i>.",
    "51063": "The case in construction here is accusative. Thus  श्वेतच्छत्रमर्हति = श्वेतच्छत्रिकः \"who deserves the White Umbrella\". So also वास्त्रयुग्मिकः, शत्यः, शतिकः साहस्रः ॥",
    "51064": "Thus छेदं नित्यमर्हति = छैदिकः, so also भैदिकः ॥\n\n1 छेद, 2 भेद, 3 द्रोह, 4 दोह, 5 मर्त (वर्त), 6 कर्ष, 7 तीर्थ, 8 संप्रयोग, 9 विप्रयोग, 10 प्रयोग, 11 विप्रकर्ष, 12 प्रेषण, 13 संप्रश्न, 14 विप्रश्न, 15 विकर्ष, 16 प्रकर्ष, 17 विराग विरङ्गं च (from विराग is formed वैरङ्गिक), ॥",
    "51065": "Thus शिरश्छेदं नित्यमर्हति = शीर्षच्छेद्यः, or शैर्षच्छेदिकः ॥ The word शिरस् is changed irregularly into शीर्ष before the affix.",
    "51066": "The word नित्य does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. This य debars ठक् [[5.1.19]]. Thus दण्डमर्हति = दण्ड्यः 'deserving to be killed'. मुसल्यः &c.\n\n1 दण्ड, 2 मुसल, 3 मधुपर्क, 4 कशा, 5 अर्घ, 6 मेघ, 7 मेधा, 8 सुवर्ण, 9 उदक, 10 वध, 11 युग, 12 गुहा, 13 भाग, 14 इभ, 15 भङ्ग, ॥\n\nNote.- The <i>Sidhanta</i>-<i>Kaumudi</i> gives the sutra as दण्डादिभ्यो यत्; another version gives the <i>sutra</i> as दण्डादिभ्यः only drawing the affix यत् from the last <i>sutra</i>.",
    "51067": "This debars ठञ् &c. Thus उदक्या वृत्तयः, यूप्यः पलाशः, गर्त्यो देशः ॥ See [[6.1.213]].",
    "51068": "This debars ठक् and ठञ् ॥ The word पात्र denotes measure also. Thus पात्रमर्हति = पात्र्यः or पात्रियः ॥",
    "51069": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus कडङ्करमर्हति = कडङ्करीयः or कडङ्कयः 'one deserving straw' such as a cow. So also दक्षिणीयः or दक्षिण्यो ब्राह्मणः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> deserving alms.'",
    "51070": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus स्थालीबिलीयास्तण्डुलाः or स्थालीबिल्याः 'rice deserving the pot' i. e. cookable rice.",
    "51071": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus यज्ञियो ब्राह्मणः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> worthy of honor at a sacrifice.' आर्त्विजीनो ब्राह्मणः ॥\n\nVart:- After the words <i>yajna</i> and <i>ritvija</i>, these affixes have also the sense of \"deserving the performance thereof\". Thus यज्ञकर्मार्हति = यज्ञियो देशः 'a place fit for the performance of sacrifice.' ऋत्विक् कर्मार्हति = आर्त्वजीन ब्राह्मणकुलम् ॥\n\nHere ends the governing power of ठक् [[5.1.19]]: hence forward is the government of ठञ् [[5.1.18]].",
    "51072": "The force of अर्हति ceases. Thus पारायणिक श्छात्र 'a pupil, who reads under a teacher': तौरायणिको यजमानः, चान्द्रायणिकस्तपस्वी ॥ The word पारायण means a 'teacher' (परस्य करोति) ॥",
    "51073": "Thus संशयमापन्नः प्राप्तः = सांशयिकः स्थाष्टः \"a doubtful pillar\", i.e. in a precarious state.",
    "51074": "Thus योजनं गच्छति = यौजनिकः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words क्रोशशत and योजनशत. As क्रौशशतिकः, यौजनशतिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix after these two words means also \"who is worthy to be approached from so far\". As क्रोशशतादभिगमनमर्हति = क्रौशशतिको भिक्षुः, यौजनशतिक आचार्यः ॥",
    "51075": "Of the affix ष्कन्, ष् is for ङीष् [[4.1.41]], and न् for accent (VI. 1. 197.) As पन्थानं गच्छति = प꣡थिकः fem. पथिकी꣡ ॥",
    "51076": "The word नित्य qualifies the sense of the affix. Thus पन्थानं नित्यं गच्छति = पान्थः as पान्थो भिक्षां याचते ॥ Why नित्यं ? See पथिकः ॥",
    "51077": "The construction of the <i>sutra</i> shows that the base must be in the 3rd case. The word च shows that the word गच्छति 'who passes by that way' should also be read into the aphorism. Thus उत्तरपथेनाहृतं = औत्तरपथिकम् or उत्तरपथेन गच्छति = औत्तरपथिकः ॥\n\nVart :- So also after the word पथ preceded by the words वारि, जङ्गल, स्थल, कान्तार the affix has the sense of 'conveyed by that way' or 'passing by that way'. As वारिपथेनाहृतः = वारिपथिकम्, वारिपथेन गच्छति = वारिपथिकः, so also जाङ्गलपथिक, स्थालपथिक, कान्तारपथिक, masculine or neuter according as the affix means conveyed or passing.\n\nVart:- So also after the words अजपथ and शंकुपथ as, अजपथेनाहृतं गच्छति वा = आजपथिकः, शांकुपथिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes after the word स्थलपथ when the thing conveyed or brought means 'honey' or 'pepper'. As स्थालपथं मधुकं, स्थालपथं मरिचम् ॥",
    "51078": "The word कालात् bears rule in the following aphorisms upto [[5.1.96]] inclusive. Thus the next <i>sutra</i> तेन निर्वृत्तम् means 'accomplished by means thereof'. We must read the word काल into it. As मासेन निर्वृत्तम् = मासिकम् &c.",

    "51080": "The word अधीष्ट means \"honorary office\", therefore 'one solicited to teach, but who accepts no pay' [[3.3.161]], भृतः means \"engaged on wages\", भूतः means 'the time pervaded or occupied by its existence', and भावी the same as last in the future. The word denoting time will be in the second case by [[2.3.5]]. Thus मासमधीष्टः = मासिकोऽध्यापकः, so also मासंभृतः = मासिकः कर्मकरः, मासंभूतः = मासिको व्याधिः, मासंभावी = मासिक उत्सवः ॥\n\nQ. The solicitation (अध्येषण) and hiring (भरण) only take a short time, how can these acts extend over a month ?\n\nA.

    "51085": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus समामधीष्टो, भृतो भूतो भावी वा = समीनः ॥ Some say, the sense of the affix is तेन निर्वृत्तम् [[5.1.79]], as समया निर्वृत्तः = समीनः ॥",
    "51086": "In the alternative ठञ् will also apply. The <i>Vartika</i> taught in [[5.1.20]] (प्राग्वतेः संख्यापूर्वपदानां तदन्तग्रहणमलुकि) applies here also. Thus द्विमासीनः or द्वैमासिकः, त्रिमासीनः or त्रैमासिकः ॥",

    "51088": "The affix ख as well as ठञ् come in the five fold senses [[5.1.79]], [[5.1.80]], after the word वर्षा forming a <i>Dvigu</i>; and these two affixes may also be elided optionally.

    "51090": "The word षष्टिकाः may be said to be formed by adding कन् to षष्टिरात्रि in the 3rd case in construction, then eliding the word रात्रि, the force of the affix being 'matured'. Thus षष्टिरात्रेण पच्यन्ते = षष्टिकाः 'a kind of barley'. It is a name of barley and therefore does not apply to pulse, beans &c, though they may also ripen in six days.",

    "51094": "The word तद् shows that the word must be in the accusative case. अस्य shows the force of the affix, ब्रह्मचर्य्यः joins both. Thus मासं ब्रह्मचर्य्यमस्य = मासिको ब्रह्मचारी \"who practises abstinence for a month\". So also आर्धमासिकः, सांवत्सरिकः ॥\n\nAnother explanation is, the affix <i>than</i> comes after a word in the first case in construction, when the sense is that of an abstinence which lasts for such a period. As मासोऽस्य ब्रह्मचर्यस्य = मासिकं ब्रह्मचर्यम् \"an abstinence lasting for a month\". आर्धमासिकं, सांवत्सरिकं ॥\n\nIn the first case the affix relates to a person, in the second, to the vow itself. Both these explanations are valid, as the structure of the aphorism is open to both constructions.\n\nVart:- So also after the words महानाम्नी &c in the genitive construction. As महानामिकम्, गौदानिकम्, आदित्यव्रतिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- After those words, the affix means also 'who practises that'.

As अवान्तरदीक्षांचरति = अवान्तरदीक्षी, तिलव्रतिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes ड्वुन् and डिनि come after the word अष्टचत्वारिंशत्, as अष्टचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि व्रतं चरति = अष्टचत्वारिंशकः or अष्टचत्वारिंशिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The same affixes come after the words चतुर्मास्य &c, the final य being elided. As चतुर्मास्यानि चरति = चातुर्मासकः or चातुर्मासिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ण्य comes after चतुर्मास, in the sense of 'produced there'. As चतुर्षु मासेषु भवानि = चातुर्मास्यानि ॥ It refers to a sacrifice.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes, when it is a Name, as, चतुर्षु मासेषु भवा = चातुर्मासी पौर्णमासी ॥ So also आषाढी, कार्तिकी, फाल्गुनी ॥",
    "51095": "As अग्निष्टोमस्य दक्षिणा = आग्निष्टोमिकी, वाजपेयिकी, राजसूयिकी ॥\n\nThe word आख्या in the <i>sutra</i> implies that the affix comes even after those sacrifice-denoting words which do not express time [[5.1.78]]; had it not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have applied only to such sacrifice-denoting words as एकाहः, द्वादशाह, which are time-denoting words as well.

Of course this word cannot take any case-affix, it therefore only gives the sense of third case. As यथाकथाच दीयते कार्यं वा = याथाकथाचम्, हस्तेन दीयते कार्यं वा = हस्त्यम् ॥",
    "51099": "The word संपत्तिः means 'suitable, proper, it'. The word संपादिन् is formed by adding णिनि to संपद्, the force of the affix being that of necessity [[3.3.170]].

    "51106": "This debars अण्. As अयं ते योनिरृत्वियः ॥ Here there is no <i>Guna</i> by [[6.4.146]], because by <i>sutra</i> (1. 4. 16), ऋतु before the affix घस् gets the designation of पद, hence the <i>guna</i> rule which applies to भ (1.4. 18) does not apply.",

    "52009": "Thus अनुपदं बद्धा = अनुपदीना 'a kind of shoe'; this word is always feminine. The force of अनु here is that of 'length' or 'likeness'. That is 'a shoe of the measure of a foot'.

The word अयानय is compounded of two words अय, meaning 'going from right to left', and अनय 'from left to right', and it means a particular position in which the pieces moving from right to left and left to right cannot move further, and attack the other pieces.\n\nAccording to some अयानयीन is the name of the front pieces in ones own row of chess-men. A piece which moves only in one side, does not admit of this affix. The piece which is carried from one side to another, admits of this affix. Others move only in one direction अय or अनय, but not both. <i>Kaiyyata</i>: यस्तु शार एक पार्श्य एव संचरति तत्र न भवति प्रत्ययो, यो हि शारः पार्श्वात् पार्श्वान्तरमानीयते, स एव अयानयं नीयते, अन्यास्तु अयमेव नीयते, अनयमेव नीयते वा ॥",

As, परांश्च परतरांश्चानुभवति = परम्परीणः ॥ Similarly पुत्रपौत्रीणः ॥\n\nThe word परम्पर is a separate word as well, not formed by or admitting this affix. As मन्त्रिपरम्परा मन्त्रं भिनत्ति ॥",

The word will mean \"an animal that gives birth to a young one every year\".\n\nVart:- Sometime there is no affixing, but the whole sentence is to be used to express this meaning, or the य् only of both members is to be elided and a sentence formed.

So also अद्यश्वीना वडवा ॥\n\nSome do not read विजायते into the <i>sutra</i>, which then means \"The word <i>adyasvina</i> is irregularly formed meaning imminent\". As अद्यश्वीनं मरणं 'imminent death'. अद्यश्वीनो वियोगः 'separation likely to take place to-day or tomorrow'.",
    "52014": "This word is formed by adding ख to the word गो preceded by the preposition आ, as आगो + ख = आगवानः ॥ The force of the affix is that of 'a servant'. A person who is engaged in business till the return of the cows, i.e. a day-labourer.",

    "52017": "The च् draws in यत् and ख. Thus अभ्यमित्रं अलंगामा = अभ्यमित्रीयः, अभ्यमित्र्यः, अभ्यमित्रीणः 'an warrior who valiantly encounters his enemy' = अमित्राभिमुखं सुष्ठु गच्छति ॥",
    "52018": "The word गोष्ठ is a compound of गो + स्था i.e. a cow-pen, it means the place all around a cow-pen. The word भूतपूर्व qualifies it. Thus गोष्ठो भूतपूर्वः = गौष्ठीनो देशः 'a place which was formerly a <i>Goshtha</i>'. Otherwise when not meaning formerly, we have गोष्ठो वर्तते ॥",
    "52019": "The word अश्वस्थ being in the sixth case shows the construction it should have before the affix. The एकाहगमः means एकाहेन गम्यते i.e. what is or can be gone over in one day. Thus अश्वस्यैकाहगमोऽध्वा = आश्वीनः, as आश्वीनानि शतं पतित्वा = यावन्ति योजनान्येकाहेनाश्वेन गम्यते तावतां शतं गत्वा ॥ सहस्राश्वीने वा इतः स्वर्गो लोकः ॥",
    "52020": "The word अधृष्ट means 'not proud', अकार्यम् means 'unfit to be done' i. e. an infamous act. The words come from शाला \"a hall\" and कूप 'a well'. It is not easy to trace any connection between 'modesty' and 'a hall', or between 'shameful' and 'a well'. However some say शालाप्रवेशनमर्हति 'who deserves to enter a hall', = शालीनः, कूपावतारमर्हति 'who deserves to be thrown into a well' = कौपीनः, hence a thing to be concealed, and the dress that conceals it. As शालीनो जडः, कौपीनं पापं ॥",
    "52021": "The word व्रात means a multitude or mass composed of various castes, who have no fixed employment, and live by violence, or by bodily labor. व्रातेन जीवति = व्रातीनः 'a person who lives by the labour of his body, not of his brain'.",
    "52022": "The word साप्तपदीन comes from सप्तपद but the connection of senses is not very clear. It is said सप्तभिः पदैरवाप्यते = साप्तपदीनम् \"formed by walking together seven steps or by talking together seven words\". The circumambulation of the Fire by the bride and bridegroom in seven steps makes the marriage irrevocable. साप्तपदीनं seems to have some connection with that. The word साप्तपदीनः or म् means 'a friend' also; the abstract sense being made applicable by analogy to the person as well.",
    "52023": "The word हैयङ्गवीनम् means 'fresh butter'. The word comes from ह्यः 'yesterday' and गो 'cow'. ह्यो गोदोहस्य विकारः 'prepared from yesterday's milk' i.e. \"fresh butter\". The affix does not come in the sense of any विकार in general. There is no affixing in ह्यो गोदोहस्य विकार when it means उदश्चित् or 'whey'.",
    "52024": "The word तस्य shows that the construction must be genitive. The affix कुणप् comes after पील्वादि words, signifying 'ripening', and the affix जाहच् comes after कर्णादि words signifying the 'root'.\n\nThus पीलूनां पाकः = पीलुकुणः, कर्कन्धुकुणः, so also कर्णस्य मूलं = कर्णजाहम्, अक्षिजाहम् ॥\n\n1 कर्ण, 2 अक्षि, 3 नख, 4 मुख, 5 केश, 6 पाद, 7 गुल्फ, 8 भ्रू, 9 शृङ्ग (भ्रूभङ्ग ! भ्रूशृङ्ग), 10 दन्त, 11 ओष्ठ, 12 पृष्ठ, 13 नख, 14 अङ्गुष्ठ ॥\n\n1 पीलु, 2 कर्कन्धु (न्धू), 3 शमी, 4 करीर, 5 कुवल, 6 बदर, 7 अश्वत्थ, 8 खदिर ॥",
    "52025": "The word मूल of the last <i>sutra</i> is drawn into this aphorism; and not the word पाक as well. This is an exceptional case of अनुवृत्ति, generally the whole is drawn and not a portion. Hence arises the following maxim क्वचिदेकदेशोऽप्यनुवर्तते \"Sometimes it also happens that only a part of the words of a rule which are mutually connected is valid in a subsequent rule, while the rest ceases to be valid\".\n\nThus पक्षस्य मूलं = पक्षतिः i. e. प्रतिपत् 'the root or the first day of a <i>Paksha</i> or a fortnight'.",
    "52026": "The word वित्त means known, illustrious. Thus विद्यया वित्तः = विद्याचुञ्चुः, विद्याचणः, केशचणः ॥ The initial च् in these affixes is not इत् [[1.3.7]].",

    "52029": "The वि is read into the <i>sutra</i> by virtue of the word च ॥ Thus संकटम्, मकटम्, उत्कटम्, विकटम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix कटच् comes after अलाबु, तिल, उमा, and भङ्गा in denoting dust thereof. As अलाबुना रजः = अलाबूकटम्, तिलकटम्, उमाकटम्, भंगाकटम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix गोष्ठच् comes after the names of animals, in denoting the places. As गवां स्थानं = गोगोष्ठं, महिषीगोष्ठं, &c.\n\nVart:- When a flock is denoted, the affix कटच् is added, as अविकटम् ॥\n\nVart:- When spreading is denoted, the affix is पटच्, and अविपटः ॥\n\nVart:- When a couple is denoted, the affix is गोयुगच्, as, अश्वगोयुगम्, उष्ट्रगोयुगम् ॥\n\nVart:- When six is denoted, the affix is षड्गवच्, as, हस्तिषड्गवम्, अश्वषड्गवम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix तैलच् comes when it means the oil of it. As एरण्डतैलम्, इंगुदीतैलम्, तिलतैलम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes शाकट and शाकिन denote 'a field where it grows', after the words इक्षु &c. As इक्षुशाकटम्, मूलशाकटम्, इक्षुशाकिनं, मूलशाकिनम् ॥",
    "52030": "As अवकुटारम्, अवकटम् 'downwards', 'very deep'.",
    "52031": "Thus नासिकाया नतम् = अवटीटम्, or अवनाटम्, अवभ्रटम् ॥ The word signifies the nose, as well as the person also, as अवटीटा नासिका, अवटीटः पुरुषः ॥",
    "52032": "Thus निबिडम् and निबिरीसम् ॥ How do you say निबिडाः केशाः or निबिडं वस्त्रम् ? It is by analogy.",
    "52033": "Thus नि + इनच् = चिक् + इनच् = चिकिनः; नि + पिटच् = चि + पिटच् = चिपिटः ॥\n\nVart:- So also comes क, and चिक replacing नि, as नि + क = चिक् + क = चिल्लः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ल comes after the word क्लिन्न in the sense of 'its eyes'; and चिल् and पिल् are substitutes of क्लिन्नः as, क्लिन्ने अस्य चक्षुषी = चिल्लः, पिल्लः 'blear-eyed'.\n\nVart:- चुल is also the substitute. As, चुल्लः ॥ These words apply to 'eye' also, as चिल्ले, पिल्ले, चुल्ले \"sore-eyes.\" They apply to person also.",
    "52034": "Thus उपत्यका = पर्वतस्थासन्नम् 'lowland, a land at the foot of the mountain', अधित्यका = पर्वतस्यारूढम् 'a table-land, high-land'. The rule [[7.3.44]] does not apply here, so we do not get the forms उपत्यिका or अधित्यिका ॥",

Similarly दिष्टिः, वितस्तिः ॥ The affix <i>matra</i> only is elided, the other two affixes are never applicable to these words.\n\nVart:- The elision is invariable after a <i>Dvigu</i>. As द्वौ शमौ प्रमाणमस्य = द्विशमः, द्विवितस्तिः ॥ Why do we say \"invariable\"? The elision will take place even where there is doubt. द्वे दिष्टी स्यातां वा न वा = द्विदिष्टिः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix डट् comes after a word, when it denotes a <i>stoma</i>; as, पंचदशस्तोमः, पंचदशी रात्रिः ॥ The ट् causes ङीप् (IV. I. I5).\n\nVart:- The affix डिनि comes after words ending in शन् or शत्, as पंचदशिनोर्द्धमासाः, त्रिंशिनो मासाः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word विंशति, as विंशिनोऽङ्गिरसः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix मात्रच् comes after words denoting lineal measure, and mass measure, and after a numeral, even when there is doubt. As शममात्रम्, = शमः प्रमाणमस्य स्यान्न वा, दिष्टिमात्रम्, प्रस्थमात्रम्, कुडवमात्रम्, पंचमात्रम्, दशमात्रा गावः ॥ An exception to this is contained in the 2nd <i>Vartika</i>, where <i>matra</i> is elided in <i>Dvigu</i> compounds, owing to the word नित्य being used there.\n\nVart:- The affixes द्वयसच् and मात्रच् come without changing the sense, diversely after a word ending in वतु; as तावद्वयसम्, = तत् परिमाणमस्य धान्यादिस्तावत् तावन्मात्रम्, एतावद्वयसम्, एतावन्मात्रम् &c.",
    "52038": "The phrase तदस्य प्रमाणं is understood here. By च the affixes द्वयसच् &c are drawn in. Thus पुरुषः प्रमाणमस्य = पौरुषम्, पुरुषद्वयसम्, पुरुषदघ्नम्, पुरुषमात्रम्, हस्तिद्वयसम्, हस्तिदघ्नम्, हस्तिमात्रम्, हास्तिनम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix is always elided after a <i>Dvigu</i>. As द्विपुरुषमुदकम्, त्रिपुरुषम्, द्विहस्ति, त्रिहस्ति, द्विपुरुषी, त्रिपुरुषी, द्विहस्तिनी त्रिहस्तिनी ॥",
    "52039": "<i>Karika</i>\n\nडावतावर्थवैशेष्यान्निर्देशः पृथुगुच्यते ।\nमात्राद्यप्रतिघाताय भावः सिद्धश्च डावतोः ॥\n\nThe phrase तदस्य is understood here. As यत् परिमाणमस्य = यावान्. This form is thus evolved; यत् + वतुप् = यावत् (the <i>ti</i> अत् being replaced by आ by [[6.3.91]] = यावन्त (the नुम् being added by [[7.1.70]]) = यावान्त (the अ being lengthened by [[6.4.41]]); the <i>vibhakti</i> सु being elided by [[6.1.68]], and त् being elided by [[8.2.23]] we get finally यावान्, तावान्, एतावान् ॥ The परिमाण is used in this <i>sutra</i>, in order to distinguish it from the word प्रमाण used in the last aphorism (See [[5.1.19]]). Therefore यत्, तद् & एतद् take the affixes '<i>matra</i>' &c also in the sense of प्रमाण, which would not have been the case, had परिमाण not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, for then the special affix वतुप् would have debarred <i>matrach</i> &c in the case of यत् &c. The word डावतु in the <i>karika</i> is the name given to this affix वतुप् by the ancient grammarians; so that according to them there was no necessity of [[6.3.91]] to replace टि of यत् &c, by आ; thus यत् + डावतु = यावत् ॥\n\nMoreover the affix वतुप् being added in the sense of परिमाण, (capacity ) only after यत् &c, it follows that the words so formed, may take the further affix मात्रच् &c in the additional sense of प्रमाण (length); which would not have been the case had the word परिमाण not been used in the <i>sutra</i>. Thus तत् परिमाणमस्य = तावद् as धान्यं राशीकृतं । From this तावत् we have तावत् प्रमाणमस्य कुड्यादेः = तावन्मात्रम् meaning यावद् राशीकृतस्य धान्यस्य दैर्घ्ये, तादृग् अस्यापि ॥\n\nVart:- The affix वतुप् comes in the sense of 'like this', after the words युष्मद् and अस्मद् in the <i>Chhandas</i>. As त्वावतः पुरुवसो यज्ञं विप्रस्य मात्रतः ॥",
    "52040": "Thus किम् + वतुप् की + वतुप् [[6.3.90]] = क् + घतुप् [[6.4.148]] = कियत् nom. कियान्. Similarly इयत् nom. इयान् ॥",
    "52041": "The च introduces the affix वतुप् which is changed into घतुप् (इयत्) ॥\n\nThe word संख्यापरिमाणे means संख्यायाः परिमाणं i.e. संख्यापरिच्छेदः 'making estimate by numbers'. As का संख्या परिमाणमेषां ब्राह्मणानां = कति ब्राह्मणाः or कियन्तो ब्राह्मणाः 'how many <i>Brahmanas</i> in number do you estimate these'. This always comes in the plural.\n\nThis word is formed, in fact, when a question is put relating to the numerical quantity (<i>sankhya</i>-<i>parimana</i>) of any thing. But the word <i>sankhya</i>-<i>parimana</i> may be explained also as a <i>Karmadharaya</i>, in which the attributive word has been placed second. It will then mean \"quantitative number\". The <i>sutra</i> will be rendered thus: \"<i>kim</i> takes <i>dati</i>, when it means a quantitative number\". It should not be objected that numbers are always quantitative, and therefore <i>parimana</i> is redundant in the aphorism. For sometimes numbers are used not to define any quantity but merely to mark contempt. As in the following:-\n\nअव्रतानाममन्त्राणां जातिमात्रोपजीविनाम् । सहस्रशः समतानां पारषत्वं न विद्यते॥ Here the word सहस्रशः is used indefinitely in a contemptuous sense. Therefore, it is not true that a number always defines a quantity. Where किम् is used to express contemptuous number, no affixing takes place : as केयमेषां संख्या दशानाम् ॥ The word <i>parimana</i> in this <i>sutra</i> is not used in its technical sense; as in <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.39]] <i>ante</i>: for its very repetition here shows that it is used here to denote 'quantity' in general, and not 'capacity', for a number cannot mean 'capacity'.",
    "52042": "The word तदस्य is understood here. Thus पंच अवयवा अस्य = पंचतयम् 'having five parts'. The part being connected with the whole, the force of the affix is to denote the whole. So also दशतयम्, चतुष्टयम्, चतुष्टयी [[8.3.101]] and [[4.5.15]]",
    "52043": "As द्वाववयवावस्य = द्वयम् or द्वितयम्, त्रयम् or त्रितयम् 'a couple' 'a triad' [[6.4.148]].\n\nThe word तय is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate the <i>sthanin</i> or thing to be replaced. Had it not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus द्वित्रिभ्यामयज् वा \"<i>ayach</i> optionally comes after <i>dvi</i> and <i>tri</i>\". Here <i>ayach</i> would have become a separate affix, instead of being a mere substitute. Where is the harm in its being a separate affix? Then the word त्रयम् or द्वयम् will not form their feminine in ङीप्; but अय being taken as <i>sthanivat</i> to तय (1. 1. 56), the affix ङीप् which by [[4.1.15]], applies to तय, applies to अय also. Thus we have त्रयी गतिः ॥ Moreover by [[1.1.33]], words ending in तय are declined as Pronouns optionally before nominative plural termination. By the rule of <i>sthanivat</i> <i>adesa</i> [[1.1.56]], the words ending in अय will also be Pronouns. As द्वये or द्वयाः त्रये or त्रयाः ॥ The च् in अयच् is for accent, showing that the substitute '<i>aya</i>' differs in accent from the <i>sthani</i> <i>taya</i>.",
    "52044": "The affix अय꣡च् having indicatory च् takes the acute accent on the final syllable [[6.1.163]], i. e. on य, the special mention of the <i>udatta</i> in the  <i>sutra</i> shows that the accent should be on a syllable which would otherwise not have taken it i. e. the first syllable i. e. अ; for had this not been the meaning, there was no necessity of using the word <i>udatta</i> in the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nIf उभ is a <i>Sankhya</i> word (1. 1. 23) in the secular sense, it would have taken तयप्, the present <i>sutra</i> ordains अय꣡ instead as a substitute always. If it is not a <i>Sankhya</i>, then we should first ordain तयप् after it, by the process of splitting the <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.42]] <i>ante</i> into two, thus संख्यायाः तयप्, अवयवे तयप् and then replace तयप् by अय꣡ ॥\n\nThus उभौ पीतलोहितौ अवयवौ यस्य = उभयः ॥ उभ꣡ये देवमनुष्याः; उभ꣡योः मणिः ॥",

So also एकादशं सहस्रं ॥\n\nWhy do we say ending in दशन् ? Observe पंचाधिका अस्मिन् शते ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"ending\" ? Observe दशाधिका अस्मिन् शते ॥ \n\n<i>Ishti</i>:- This rule applies when both words denote a thing of the same denomination. As एकादश कार्षापणा अधिका अस्मिन् कार्षापण शते = एकादशं कार्षापणशतं ॥ But not here:- एकादश माषा अधिका अस्मिन् कार्षापणशते ॥\n\n<i>Ishti</i>:- This applies only after शत and सहस्र, therefore it does not apply here :- एकादशाधिका अस्यां त्रिंशत् ॥\n\nThe word इति in the <i>sutra</i> is for clearness. The rule applies to शतसहस्रं also, as एकादशं शतसहस्रं which may mean either (1) एकादश शतान्यधिकान्यस्मिन् or (2) एकादश सहस्राण्यधिकान्यस्मिन् ॥",
    "52046": "The indicatory ड् causes elision of टि portion [[6.4.142]] &c. Thus विंशदधिका अस्मिञ्छते = त्रिंशं शतं, एकत्रिंशं शतं, एकचत्वारिंशं शतं ॥ This rule applies to abstract Numerals. Hence not here, गोत्रिंशदधिका अस्मिन् गोशते ॥\n\nSo also after विंशति; as विंशं शतं ॥\n\nVart:- So also after compounds ending in विंशति, as, एकविंशं शतं ॥ This also applies to pure Numbers. Therefore not here, गो विंशतिरधिका अस्मिन् गो शतं ॥",
    "52047": "The word तदस्य from [[5.2.36]] should be read in this. The sense of the aphorism is \"after a Numeral in the first case in construction (तद्), with the force of a genitive (अस्य), comes the affix मयट्, when the word in the first case in construction denotes the value (निमान) of a portion (गुण)\". The word गुण means भाग or \"portion\", and निमान means 'price'. In comparing the quality of one thing with another, निमान is the value or price. Thus यवानां द्वौ भागौ निमानमस्योदश्विद्भागस्य = द्विमयमुदश्विद्यवानाम् \"two parts of <i>Yava</i> is the price of one part <i>Udasvit</i>\". Similarly त्रिमयम्, चतुर्मयम्, lit. \"<i>Udasvit</i> is द्विमय or 'two-times' the value of <i>yava</i>\".\n\nThe word गुणस्य is in the singular number. The comparison must therefore be made with one portion of a thing, with the several portions of the other. The ratio must be x:1, but never x:2, or x:3 &c. Therefore the rule does not apply here, द्वौ भागौ यवानां त्रय उदश्वितः ॥ The x also must be more than one. The rule therefore does not apply here: एको भागो निमानमस्य ॥\n\nThe word गुण denotes an integral number, therefore the rule will not apply to fraction. As द्वौ भागौ यवानामध्यर्द्ध उदश्वितः ॥\n\nThe affix also comes in the sense of purchasing or the comparative value of a thing, i. e. in denoting the thing received in exchange (निमेय) As उदश्वितो द्वौ भागौ निमेयमस्य यवभागस्य = द्विमयाः, as द्विमया यवा उदश्वितः = उदश्वितो द्वौ गुणौ निमेयौ येषामेकगुणानां यवानां \"the exchange value of <i>Udasvita</i> is twice as much as that of a <i>Yava</i>\". The word निमान means the thing given in exchange; and निमेय the thing received in exchange. Both words are reciprocal and are terms of barter or exchange, but they do not apply to sales or purchases for coins.\n\nWhy do we say गुणस्य 'of a portion'? Observe द्वौ व्रीहियवौ निमानमस्योदश्वितः ॥ Here being no comparison of ratios, there is no affixing.\n\nWhy do we say निमाने \"in denoting the thing given in exchange\"? Observe, द्वौ गुणौ क्षीरस्य एकस्तैलस्य = द्विगुणं पच्यते तैलं क्षीरेण \"one part of oil cooks or absorbs as much as two parts of milk\". Here the sense is that of 'cooking' and not of purchasing.\n\nIn short मयट् has the meaning of 'time or fold'. As द्विमय \"two time\", the word qualifying sometime the निमान, sometime the निमेय; e.g. द्विमयमुदश्वित् यवानां '<i>Udasvit</i> is two-times or two-fold of <i>Yava</i> in value', or द्विमया यवा उदश्वितः \"two-times <i>Yava</i> are equal to one <i>Udasvit</i>\".",
    "52048": "That by which a thing is completed is called पूरण ॥ Thus एकादशानां पूरणः = एकादशः the \"eleventh\" (i. e. the one which, added to ten, completes the eleven). Similarly त्रयोदशः ॥ By this affix, ordinals are formed. The rule therefore, does not apply to a case like this:- पंचानां मुष्टिकानां पूरणो घटः ॥",
    "52049": "Thus पंचमः 'fifth' (the completer of the five), सप्तमः ॥ Why do we say 'ending in म्'? Observe विंशतेः पूरणो = विंशः 'twentieth'. Why do we say 'not preceded by a Numeral'? Observe एकादशानां पूरणं = एकादशः ॥",
    "52050": "Thus पंचथः, सप्तथः or पंचमः, सप्तमः ॥ As पर्णमयानि पञ्चथानि भवन्ति and पञ्चममिन्द्रियमस्यापाञ्च्यमन् ॥ See [[5.2.56]].",
    "52051": "The डट् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>, and it should be changed into locative, as डटि 'when <i>dat</i> follows'.

Thus षण्णां पूरणो = षष्ठः 'sixth'. कतिथः 'the which in order?' कतिपयथः 'the one in order after several', चतुर्थः 'the fourth'.\n\nVart:- The affixes छ (ईय) and यत् come after चतुर् and there is elision of the first letter.

    "52053": "The word डटि is understood here also. The words ending in वतु are Numerals (1. 1. 23): and they will take डट् by [[5.2.48]]; the present <i>sutra</i> declares the augment. Thus यावतां पूरणो = यावतिथः, तावतिथः, एतावतिथः ॥",
    "52054": "This debars डट् ॥ Thus द्वयोः पूरणो = द्वितीयः 'the second' -- that which completes the two.",
    "52055": "The substitution of a vowel for a semi-vowel is <i>samprasarana</i> (I. I. 45). Thus त्रि + तीय = तृ + इ + तीय = तृतीयः ([[6.1.108]], the इ of त्रि assumes the form of the prior letter ऋ which is substituted for र्). In तृतीयः the ऋ is not lengthened by [[6.4.2]], because that rule applies to the lengthening of the अण् letters only, this word being read into [[6.4.2]], by <i>anuvritti</i> from (VI. 3. III). The <i>pratyahara</i> अण् is formed by the first ण्, and means the letters अ, इ and उ ॥",
    "52056": "This rule falling under the jurisdiction of पूरण, we must read the word डट् into this <i>sutra</i>, as the affix to which the augment तमट् is added. Thus विंशतेः पूरणः = विंशतितमः or विंशः 'twentieth'. एकविंशतितमः or एकविंशः, त्रिविंशतितमः or त्रिविंशः, त्रिंशत्तमः or त्रिंशः, एकत्रिंशत्तमः or एकत्रिंशः ॥\n\nThere is no विंशत्यादि class given in <i>Ganapatha</i>. These are ordinary words like विंशति, त्रिंशत् &c. The words विंशति, त्रिंशत् &c of [[5.1.59]], should not be taken as the विंशत्यादि alluded to by this <i>sutra</i>. For had it been so, we could not have formed the words like एकविंशतितमः; because the rule applying to विंशति specifically mentioned, will not apply to विंशति as the end of a compound. As this maxim declares, ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>Pratipadika</i>, does, contrary to (1. 1. 72); not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself\". This being the case, the word विंशति &c must be taken in their popular signification, and not as particular <i>pratipadikas</i>; and hence also becomes valid the exception given in [[5.2.58]], in the case of षष्टि &c when preceded by another numeral. For the very prohibition असंख्यादेः in that rule, shows, that with the exception of षष्टि &c, the present rule applies to other संख्यादि words, as, एकविंशति &c.\n\nBohtlingk takes मट्, थट् and तमट् as separate affixes and not as augment. He says \"The commentators take तमट् here and in the following <i>Sutras</i> as an Augment of डट् [[5.2.48]], because विंशति  &c with the affix तमट् would yield विंशतित꣡म by [[3.1.3]], whilst otherwise it would be accented as विंशतितम꣡ ॥ According to this interpretation मट् [[5.2.49]] and थट् [[5.2.50]] are Augments, though they would yield the right form as affixes also. That <i>Panini</i> by forms मट्, थट् and मयट् so much resembling डट्, should not have meant an affix, is not probable. Moreover one does not understand well this, why he, if he intended that म, थ and तम should be taken as augments, does not, for the sake of clearness, ordain this after the stem, which could have been expressed by adding of the servile क् (i. e. मुक्, थुक् and तमुक्), as he does in the case of the augments थुक् [[5.2.51]], तिथुक् [[5.2.52]] and इथुक् [[5.2.53]]. I also think this, that <i>Panini</i>, when he designated this affix तमट्, did not think of the accent.\"\n\nIn the case of मट् and थट् there will be no difference whatever whether we take them as affixes or as augments. Thus पंचन् + मट् = पंच् + मट् [[6.4.144]] = पंचम ॥",
    "52057": "The words शतादय are numerals. The words मास &c, are not numerals; they would not have taken डट्, but by the implication of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus शतस्य पूरणः = शततमः 'hundreth'; सहस्रतमः, लक्षतमः ॥ Similarly मासस्य पूरणः = मासतमो दिवसः 'the last day of the month'. अर्द्धमासतमः, संवत्सरतमः ॥\n\nBy the next <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.58]], the words शत &c, would also have taken तमट्; but the scope of that <i>sutra</i> is confined to numerals not preceded by another numeral. There is no such restriction here. Hence we have एकशततमः, द्विशततमः ॥",
    "52058": "By <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.56]], the augment was optional, this makes it compulsary. Thus षष्टितमः, सप्ततितमः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not preceded by a Numeral\"? Observe, एकषष्टः एकषष्टितमः, एकसप्तमः or एकसप्ततितमः ॥ Here [[5.2.56]], applies also.",
    "52059": "The word मतौ means 'in the sense of मतुप् affix'. The sense of मतुप् is \"whose is it or in whom it is\". Thus अच्छावाक् शब्दोऽस्मिन् = अच्छावाकीयम् सूक्तम् ॥ मित्रावरुणीयम्, यज्ञायज्ञीयम् साम, वारवन्तीयम् साम ॥\n\nThe affix comes after a collocation of words, as अस्यवामीयं 'the <i>Sukta</i> containing the words अस्य वाम' e.g. <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> <i>Mandala</i> l. <i>sukta</i> 164. Here the words अस्य वामस्य are considered as a Nominal Stem. So also कयापुमीयम् ॥",
    "52060": "This <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication (ज्ञापकः), that the affix छ comes after a nominal stem, to denote an <i>Adhyaya</i> or an <i>Anuvaka</i>.

    "52068": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of कन्, not of ठक् is to be read here. The word सस्य here means 'good quality', and not 'corn'. Another reading is शस्य. The word परि means 'all, every where'.

    "52071": "Thus ब्राह्मणको देशः, उष्णिका यवागूः ॥ The affix कन् is added to ब्राह्मण, with the force of 'a place where <i>Brahmanas</i> who live by profession of arms dwell'. Similarly उष्णिक means अल्पान्नाः ॥",
    "52072": "The word शीत and उष्ण being used as adverbs will be in accusative construction. As शीतं करोति 'who goes to work coldly' i.e. a lazy man = शीतकः = अलसः, जडः. Similarly उष्णकः = शीघ्रकारी, दक्षः 'who goes to work hotly'.",
    "52073": "The word अधिकः meaning 'more', is formed by adding कन् to the word अध्यारूढ; there being elision of the second term before the affix. Thus अधिको द्रोणः खार्याम् \"a <i>Drona</i> is superior to <i>Khari</i>\" अधिका खारी द्रोणेन \"a <i>Khari</i> is inferior to <i>Drona</i>\". The word अध्यारूढ governs nominative or accusative indifferently.",
    "52074": "Thus अनुकामयते = अनुकः 'desirous, libidinous'. अभिकामयते = अभिकः or अभीकः 'a lover, voluptuous person'.",
    "52075": "The word पार्श्वम् means 'a fraudulent or crooked expedient'. One who endeavours to obtain any thing by fraud is called पार्श्वकः 'a cheat, a juggler, a partisan'. पार्श्व = a rib, a crooked thing; as पार्श्वकः = मायाविन्, कौसृतिकः, जालिकः &c.",
    "52076": "The word अन्विच्छति is understood here also. The word अयःशूलम् means 'a violent proceeding'. Who seeks to obtain any thing by violent means is called आयः शूलिकः = साहसिकः ॥ The word दण्डाजिन means 'staff (<i>danda</i>) and hide (<i>ajina</i>)' i.e. outer badges of devotion or hypocrisy. Who seeks to gain something by hypocrisy and deceit is called दाण्डाजिनिकः = दाम्भिकः ॥",
    "52077": "The word तावतिथं [[5.2.53]] stands here as a type of all words ending in affixes denoting i.e. ordinals. The word ग्रहण means 'acquired or Iearned hereby'. This qualifies the base. Thus द्वितीयेन रूपेण ग्रन्थं गृह्णाति = द्विकं ग्रहणम् or द्वितीयकं ग्रहणम् 'the acquisition of the knowledge or book by the second time' i.e, \"successful mastery by the second time\". So also त्रिकं or त्रितीयकम्, चतुष्कम् or चतुर्थकम् ॥\n\nVart:- When the word, formed by the affix <i>kan</i>, means the person who acquires after so many times then the elision of the पूरण affix is compulsory and not optional. Thus षष्ठेन रूपेण ग्रन्थं गृह्णाति = षट्को देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> who learns the book for the sixth time' i.e. 'who succeeds in learning the book at the sixth attempt'. Similarly पंचकः, चतुष्कः ॥ The word ग्रहण here is confined to books only and to nothing else.",
    "52078": "The word ग्रामणी means 'head-man, leader, spokes-man'. Thus देवदत्तो ग्रामणीरेषां = देवदत्तकाः, यज्ञदत्तकाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a leader'? Witness देवदत्तः शत्रुरेषाम् ॥ Here there is no affixing.",
    "52079": "Thus शृंखलं बन्धनमस्य करभस्य = शृंखलकः ॥  The young ones of camel are called करभ ॥ The wooden clogs put on their feet to prevent them from straying are called शृंखल ॥ Though the ropes &c are also used along with the clog, yet <i>srinkhala</i> being the principal object that takes away the freedom is called बन्धन or bond or fetter.",
    "52080": "He whose mind anxiously desires or yearns after a thing is called उन्मनः ॥ The word उत्कः is formed by adding कन् to the preposition उद्. Thus उत्को देवदत्तः, उत्कः प्रवासी = उत्सुकः or उत्कण्ठितः ॥",
    "52081": "The word काल means 'days' &c, and प्रयोजन means 'the cause (of disease) or its effect'. Thus द्वितीयेऽह्निभवः = द्वितीयको ज्वरः 'the fever which comes on the second day'. चतुर्थकः 'a fever which comes on the fourth day'. Similarly after a word denoting प्रयोजनः, as, विषपुष्पैर्जनितः = विषपुष्पको ज्वरः 'a fever caused by poisonous flowers'. So also काषपुष्पकः ॥ So also उष्णं कार्यमस्य = उष्णकः 'a fever producing heat', शीतको ज्वरः ॥\n\nWhen 'illness' is not meant, then there is no affixing, as, द्वितीयो दिवसोऽस्य ॥ The word संज्ञा is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> from the next <i>sutra</i>. Therefore words द्वितीयकः &c are Names.",
    "52082": "Thus गुडापूपाः प्रायेणान्नमस्या पौर्णमास्यां = गुडापूपिका पौर्णमासी \"The <i>Gudapupika</i> - <i>Paurnmasi</i>\" i. e that particular Full- Moon day in which cakes of sugar form the principal accompaniment of food. Similarly तिलापूपिका, कृशरिका, त्रिपुटिका &c.\n\nVart:- The affix इनि comes after वटक in the same sense. As वटकिनी पौर्णमासी ॥",
    "52083": "The ञ् of अञ् is for the sake of causing <i>Vriddhi</i> and accent. Thus कुल्माषाः प्रायेणान्नमस्यां = कौल्माषी पौर्णमासी ॥",
    "52084": "The न् in श्रोत्रियन् is for the sake of accent. As श्रो꣡त्रियो ब्राह्मणः \"a <i>Brahmana</i> learned in the Vedas\". The word श्रोत्रिय is either a condensed expression for the full sentence छन्दोऽधीते, referring to no particular base or affix. Or the word छन्दस् is replaced by श्रोत्र, and then is added the affix घन् ॥ But how do you form then छान्दसः, in the sense of छन्दोऽधीते, by adding the affix or अण् by [[4.2.59]] ? The present <i>sutra</i> is optional, the word वा of [[5.2.77]] being understood here: so that we have the form श्रोत्रियः also. Some say that श्रोत्रिय applies only to that person who has not only studied the Vedas but who acts upon its purport also, while छान्दस applies to a student in general, so one <i>sutra</i> does not debar the other, as they apply to different objects.",
    "52085": "Thus श्राद्धं भुक्तमनेन = श्राद्धी or श्राद्धिकः \"a person who has eaten obsequial food\". This relates to a person who eats on the day the <i>Sraddha</i> ceremony takes place; and not at any other time nor who eats stale food of <i>sraddha</i>. अद्य भुक्ते श्राद्धे श्वः श्राद्धिक इति माभूत् ॥ The word श्राद्ध originally means a certain ceremony, and is derived from the word श्रद्धा with the affix ञ [[5.2.101]]. In a figurative sense, it here means the food taken at that ceremony.",
    "52086": "The word अनेन of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here. But what is the verb of which अनेन is the agent. The भुक्त does not come to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore we must supply some general verb such as 'doing' &c, to complete the sense. Thus पूर्वं गतमनेन = पूर्वी ॥ So also पूर्वं भुक्तं, पीतं &c. अनेन = पूर्वी s. पूर्विणौ d. पूर्विणः pl. In fact पूर्विन् means by whom some thing was done &c, formerly.",
    "52087": "Thus कृतपूर्वी कटम् = पूर्वं कृतमनेन 'who formerly made'. भुक्तपूर्वी ओदनम् ॥\n\nIn these words, first कृत and पूर्व are compounded by [[2.1.4]]; and then the affix is added. These two <i>sutras</i> [[5.2.86]], [[5.2.87]], give rise to these two maxims ग्रहनवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>Pratipadika</i> or Nominal-stem, does, (contrary to (l. 1.72)) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself.\" व्यपदेशिवद्भावोऽप्रातिपदिकेन \"The rule of <i>vyapadesivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> does not apply to a <i>pratipadika</i>\". That rule is embodied in the following <i>paribhasha</i>- व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन् -- \"an operation which affects some thing on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\".",
    "52088": "Thus इष्टमनेन = इष्टी यज्ञे; पूर्त्तीश्राद्धे &c. \"who wished\", \"who performed a charitable act\". The words इष्टिन्, पूर्त्तिन् &c. formed by इन् will govern locative instead of accusative. See <i>vartika</i> under [[2.3.36]].\n\n1 इष्ट 2 पूर्त, 3 उपासादित (उपसादित), 4 निगदित, 5 परिगदित, 6 परिवादित, 7 निकथित, 8 निपादित, 9 निपठित, 10 संकलित, 11 परिकलित, 12 संरक्षित, 13 परिरक्षित, 14 अर्चित, 15 गणित, 16 अवकीर्ण, 17 आयुक्त, 18 गृहीत, 19 आम्नात, 20 श्रुत (आम्नातश्रुत), 21 अधीत, 22 अवधान (!), 23 आसेवित, 24 अवधारित, 25 अवकल्पित, 26 निराकृत, 27 उपकृत, 28 उपाकृत, 29 अनुयुक्त, 30 अनुगणित, 31 अनुपठित, 32 व्याकुलित, 33 परिकथित, 34 संकल्पित, 35 विकलित 36 निपतित, 37 पठित, 38 पूजित, 39 परिगणित, 40 उपगणित, 41 परित (!) 42 अपवारित, 43 उपनत, 44 निगृहीत, 45 अपचित. ॥",
    "52089": "The word पर्यवस्थातृ means 'an adversary, an antagonist'. Thus मा त्वा॑ परिप॒॒रिणो॑ विद॒॒न् मा त्वा॑ परिपं॒॒थिनो विद॒॒न् (<i>Yaj</i>. <i>Ved</i>. IV. 34). These words are obsolete in secular literature. See however <i>Gita</i> III. 34.",
    "52090": "Thus अनुपदी गवाम, अनुपदी उष्ट्राणाम् \"going after or searching the cows and camels\".",
    "52091": "The word साक्षात् is an Indeclinable. The word संज्ञा is used in the aphorism to restrict the sense of the word. Thus साक्षाद् द्रष्टा = साक्षी, d. साक्षिणौ, pl. साक्षिणः 'an eye-witness'. In any transaction like loan, &c, three persons directly see the fact, and may be called द्रष्टा, viz. who gives, who takes, and another who merely looks on. By using the word संज्ञा, the word साक्षिन् is restricted to the mere looker on, and not to the lender or borrower.",
    "52092": "The whole word enunciated here in the sense of <i>para</i>-<i>kshetre</i> <i>chikitsya</i>; or the word क्षेत्रिय, with acute on the last syllable, is formed by adding the affix घच् to the word परक्षेत्र, the force of the affix being 'curable therein' and the word पर is elided before this affix. Thus क्षेत्रियो व्याधिः 'incurable disease'. क्षेत्रियं कुष्ठं 'incurable Ieprosy': i.e. --organic disease. The word परक्षेत्र means body assumed in the next reincarnation. The word क्षेत्रिय applies to an irremediable disease.\n\nThe word क्षेत्रियं means 'poison' also = यत् परछेत्रे परशरीरेसंक्रमय्य चिकित्स्यते ॥ 'that which is to be removed from another's body where it has entered'. Or क्षेत्रिय means 'rank growth or grass', i.e. यानि सस्यार्थे क्षेत्रे जातानि चिकित्स्यानि नाशयितव्यानि ॥ \"that like grass &c, which grows in a <i>para</i>-<i>kshetra</i> or another's field i. e. a field set apart for grain &c, and not for grass, and which therefore must be weeded out (<i>chikitsya</i>)\" Or क्षेत्रिय is an 'adulterer', i.e. परदाराः परक्षेत्रं, तत्र चिकित्स्यः निगृहीतव्यः ॥ These are all secondary meanings.",
    "52093": "The word इंद्रिय is a primitive word, meaning organs of sense, such as eyes &c. Its derivation is obscure, if it is a derivative word at all. In the latter alternative, it may be said to be formed by the affix घच् added after इन्द्र, in the sense of either 'a mark thereof'. As इन्द्रस्य लिङ्गम् = इन्द्रियम् ॥ The senses (<i>indriyas</i>) are so called because, <i>Indra</i> is <i>Atma</i> or soul, and it is inferred by the existence of the senses, eyes, ears &c. So that these organs are the 'marks or signs or <i>linga</i> of <i>Indra</i> : because they being an instrument presupose an agent, there being no instrument without an agent.\n\nOr the senses (<i>indriyas</i>) are so-called because they are 'seen or known by <i>Indra</i> or <i>Atma</i>' (इन्द्रेण दृष्टं = ज्ञातं). The affix is here added to a word in the third case in construction. The knowing or perceiving of the senses by the Self is an allusion to the following <i>Sruti</i> of the <i>Aitareya</i> <i>Upanishad</i> Chapter 111. verse 13, where the Self having created the physical body took a survey of it. स एतमेव पुरुषं ब्रह्म ततमम पश्यदिदमदर्शमिती \"He beheld this <i>Brahma</i> who dwells in the body who pervades everywhere, and exclaimed -- 'I have seen this'. Or they are so called because they are created by <i>Indra</i> or <i>Atma</i> (इन्द्रेण सृष्टं) i. e. the senses are formed according to the good and bad deeds of the Self. Or they are so called because they are wished for by <i>Indra</i> or Self (इन्द्रेण जुष्टं सेवितं) as they are the gate-ways of knowledge. Or they are so called because they are given by <i>Indra</i> (इन्द्रेण दत्तं) i. e. they are allotted to their respective objects by <i>Indra</i> e. g. the eye is given to perceive forms, the ear to perceive sounds and so on. The word वा 'or' joins every one of the above. The word इति shows, that there may be other appropriate significations also: As, इन्द्रेण दुर्जयम् = इन्द्रियम् 'senses' -- difficult to be subdued by the Soul.",
    "52094": "Thus गावोऽस्य सन्ति = गोमत् nom. गोमान् 'having cows', as गोमान् देवदत्तः ॥ वृक्षा अस्मिन् सन्ति = वृक्षवत् (व being substituted for म by [[8.2.9]]), as वृक्षवान् पर्वतः ॥ Similarly यवमान्, प्लक्षमान् ॥ The word इति shows that the use of मतुप् and cognate affixes are restricted in their application. For example, a person who has three barley grains only will not be called यववान् ॥ This affix comes when the significations are (1) A large quantity or number, as गोमान् 'having many cows'. (2) When censure (निन्दा) is implied, as ककुदावर्त्ती, संखादकी (3) when praise (प्रशंसा) is meant, as रूपवती कन्या, (4) when an inherent or permanent quality of a thing is meant (नित्ययोग) as, क्षीरिणी वृक्षः ॥ (5) When excellence (अतिशायन) is meant, as, उदरिणी कन्या ॥ (6) When accompaniment (संसर्ग) is meant, as दण्डी, छत्री ॥ (7) When the sense of अस्ति 'to be' is denoted, as अस्तिमान् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix मतुप् is elided after words of quality (गुणवचन), as शुक्लो गुणोऽस्यास्ति = शुक्लः पटः ॥ कृष्णः, श्वेतः &c.",
    "52095": "As रसवान्, रूपवान्, गन्धवान् ॥ Why this special <i>sutra</i> with regard to रसादि words, when they would have taken मतुप् by the last <i>sutra</i>? This prevents the application to these words of other affixes having the sense of मतुप् ॥ How do you form then रूपिणी कन्या, रूपिको दारकः ॥ These are rare forms. According to <i>Patanjali</i> this <i>sutra</i> is useless. Or the word रस &c, must denote qualities, perceivable by the organs of taste, touch &c, i. e. रस should mean taste, रूप form. Therefore the forms रूपिणी and रूपिकः are valid, meaning शोभायोग्यता ॥ So also रसिको तटः = भावयोगः, here रूप and रस do not mean 'form' and 'taste'. And all words of quality having one syllable are governed by this <i>sutra</i>, and form their derivative in मतुप् ॥ See [[5.2.115]].\n\n1 रस, 2 रूप, 3 वर्ण, 4 गन्ध, 5 स्पर्श, 6 शब्द, 7 स्नेह, 8 भाव, 9 गुणात्, (गुणग्रहणं रसादीनां विशेषणम्), 10 एकाचः (स्ववत्) ॥",

Observe शिखावान् प्रदीपः 'the crested flame of a lamp'. Why do we say \"ending in आ\"? Observe हस्तवान्, पादवान् ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the affix लच् comes only after what denotes member or limb of a living being, (and not anything like love, passion, intelligence &c, that are also found in living being). Hence there is no affixing of लच् here : चिकीर्षाऽस्यास्ति = चिकीर्षावान्, जिहीर्षावान् ॥\n\nEvery affix is <i>udatta</i> [[3.1.3]], unless contrary is indicated by some <i>anubandha</i>. The लच् would have been udatta by [[3.1.3]], even without the indicatory च् (V1. 1. 163). The employment of this <i>anubandha</i>, however indicates that this <i>udatta</i> will never be changed into <i>svarita</i>, as other <i>udattas</i> are by rule [[8.2.6]], as चूडालोऽसि ॥",
    "52097": "Thus सिध्मलः or सिध्मवान्, गडुलः or गडुवान् ॥ The word अन्यतरस्याम् understood in this <i>sutra</i>, causes the employment of the affix मतुप् in the alternative.

The word वत्स means 'calf'; in वत्सल there is no trace of its origin, for it is applied to father, master &c, as वत्सलः स्वामी, वत्सलः पिता &c. The word अंस means 'shoulder': but अंसल means 'strong'. The affix लच् in these cases is not optional, but necessary and debars मतुप् ॥ In other senses, the <i>matup</i> only is added as अंसवती गौः, अंसवान् दुर्बलः ॥",

To this it is replied, that by the next <i>sutra</i>, these words take the affix अण् also; so that, had there not been this present <i>sutra</i>, the अण् would have debarred the application of इनि and विनि of [[5.2.115]] and [[5.2.121]].

Therefore it will not apply here ऊषोऽस्मिन् घटे विद्यते 'there is salt in this pot', we cannot say ऊषरो घटः, nor मधुरो घटः for मध्वस्मिन् घटे विद्यते ॥\n\nVart:- The affix र comes after ख, मुख and कुञ्ज, as खमस्यास्ति कण्डविवरं महत् = खरः 'an ass, lit. having a wide throat'. मुखमस्यास्ति इति सर्वस्मिन् वक्तव्ये = मुखरः 'talkative', कुञ्जावस्य स्तः = कुञ्जरः 'an elephant having tusks'. The word कुञ्ज means the tusk of an elephant or the lower jaw of an elephant. The word कुञ्जर is a common name for all elephants.\n\nVart:- The affix र comes after नग, पांसु and पाण्डु, as नगरम् 'a city, lit. having trees (<i>naga</i> = tree)', पांसुरम्, पाण्डुरम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after कच्छू, the vowel being shortened: as कच्छुरम् ॥",

    "52109": "Though the word अन्यतरस्याम् was understood here from [[5.2.96]] (see <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.97]]; its repetition shows that in the alternative we have not only मतुप् but the affixes इनि and ठन् [[5.2.115]] also. Thus we have four forms: केशवः, केशी, केशिकः and केशवान् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix व is seen after other words also. As मणिवः 'a kind of serpent', हिरण्यवः 'a kind of gem', कररावः, कुमारवः, राजीवम्, कुञ्जावः, इष्टकावः ॥\n\nVart:- The final of अर्णस् is elided before व, as अर्णवः ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, the affixes ई, वनिप्, व and मतुप् come in the sense of मतुप् ॥ Thus ईः- रथीरभून् मुद्गलानी गविष्टौ (रथीः), सुमङ्गलीरियं वधूः; वनिप् :- मघवानमीमहे; व and मतुप्, as उद्वा or उद्वती ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes इरन् and इरच् come respectively after मेधा and रथः as, मे꣡धिरः, रथिरः ॥",
    "52110": "As गाण्डीवं 'the bow <i>Gandiva</i> of <i>Arjuna</i>'  अजगवं 'the bow <i>Ajagava</i> of <i>Siva</i>'. There is shortening also, as गाण्डिवं ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is so framed, that the word गाण्डी and गाण्डि are both included.",
    "52111": "Thus का꣡ण्डीरः and अण्डीरः꣡ ॥ Another reading has आण्ड and आण्डीरः ॥",
    "52112": "As रजस्वला स्त्री, कृषीवलः कुटुम्बी, आसुतीवलः शौण्डिकः, परिषद्वलो राजा ॥ The lengthening of vowel in कृषि and आसुति takes place by [[6.3.118]]. The affix वलच् comes only under certain senses and conditions, as shown in the above examples. Thus in रजोऽस्मिन् ग्रामे विद्यते, there is no affixing.\n\nVart:- The affix <i>valach</i> is seen after other words also. As भ्रातृवलः, पुत्रवलः, पितृवलः, उत्साहवलः ॥",
    "52113": "Thus दन्तावलः सैन्यः, दन्तावलो गजः, शिखावलं नगरम्, शिखावलो स्थूणा ॥ The final vowel of दन्त is lengthened before वल by [[6.3.118]].",
    "52114": "They are thus formed. ज्योतिष् + न = ज्योत्स्ना 'moon-light' (the इ being elided). तमस् + र = तमिस्रा 'night'. (इ being added ): it has other genders than feminine as तमिस्रं नभः 'dark sky'. शृङ्ग + इमच् = शृङ्गिणः ॥ The augment असुक् is added to ऊर्ज्, and then the affix विनि and वलच्; as ऊर्ज् + अस् + विन् = ऊर्ज्स्विन्; ऊर्ज्स्वलः ॥ गो + मिनि = गोमिन्; मल + इनच् = मलिनः; मल + ईमसच् = मलीमसः ॥",
    "52115": "Thus दण्डिन्, दण्डिकः, छत्रिन् nom. छत्री, छत्रिकः ॥ The word अन्यतरस्याम् [[5.2.96]] is understood here also, so we have मतुप्, as दण्डवान्, छत्रवान् ॥ Why do we say 'short अ'? Observe खट्वावान्. Here there is neither इन् nor ठन् ॥\n\nThese two affixes इनि and ठन् do not come after words of one syllable, after words ending in <i>krit</i>-affixes, after words denoting genus (<i>jati</i>), and when the construction is that of locative. As स्व and ख form only स्वावान्, खवान् ॥ <i>Krit</i>: as, कारकवान् ॥ Genus, as, व्याघ्रवान्, सिंहवान् ॥ Locative; as दण्डा अस्यां सन्ति = दण्डवती शाला ॥ There are, however, some exceptions to this, as <i>krit</i> :-- कार्यिन्, कार्यिकः हार्यिन्, हार्यिकः ॥ Genus (<i>jati</i>) :-- तण्डुलिन्, तण्डुलिकः ॥",
    "52116": "Thus व्रीहिन् (nom. व्रीही), व्रीहिकः, व्रीहिमान्, मायी, मायिकः, मायावान् ॥\n\nThese two affixes, however, do not come after all व्रीह्यादि words. According to <i>Patanjali</i>, the affix इनि comes after शिखादि sub-division, and the affix इकन् after यवखदादि sub-division, after the remaining words, both इनि and ठन् (= इकन्) come. The शिखादि after which इनि only comes are:- 1 शिखा, 2 मेखला, 3 संज्ञा, 4 बलाका, 5 माला, 6 वीणा, 7 वडवा, 8 अष्टका, 9 पताका, 10 कर्मन्, 11 चर्मन्, 12 हंसा, ॥ The यवखद &c. are the following 1 यवखद, 2 कुमारी, 3 मौ; they take इकन् only. The rest take both. The word व्रीहि will get these affixes by the next <i>sutra</i> also, why is it then read in this class? The word व्रीहि in the <i>Tundadi</i> class [[5.2.117]], does not mean the word-form व्रीहि, but words synonym with it. Thus शालयोऽस्य सन्ति = शालिलः, शाली, शालिकः, शालिमान् ॥ The word शीर्ष preceded by the negative particle, takes these affixes, as आशीर्षी and अशीर्षिकः ॥ The remaining words are व्रीहि, माया, शाला, केका, वर्मन्, दंष्ट्रा, संज्ञा ॥",
    "52117": "The force of च is that इनि, ठन् and मतुप् also come. As तुन्दिलः, तुन्दी, तुन्दिकः, तुन्दवान्. Similarly उदरिलः, उदरी, उदरिकः, उदरवान् ॥\n\nThe following is the list of तुन्दादि words 1 तुन्द, 2 उदर, 3 पिचण्ड, 4 घट, 5 यव, 6 व्रीहि, 7 स्वाङ्गाद्विवृद्धौ च ॥ That is to say, the affix इलच् comes after words denoting parts of one's body, when the largeness (विवृद्धि) of those organs is implied : as विवृद्धौ कर्णौ यस्य स = कार्णलः, कर्णी, कर्णिकः, कर्णवान् ॥",
    "52118": "Thus एकशतमस्यास्ति = ऐकशतिकः; गौशतिकः, गौसहस्रिकः ॥\n\nThe word अतः of [[5.2.115]], is understood here also; so that, stems not ending in अ are not governed by this rule, such as एकविंशतिरस्यास्ति, no affixing. The word ऐकगविकः is an apparent exception, it being formed by adding ठञ् to the <i>samasanta</i> word एकगव [[5.4.92]]. How do you explain गौशकटिकः formed by ठञ् from गोशकटी ? Here शकटं is taken for शकटी, both being synonyms (N. B. This opinion of the <i>Kasika</i>-author is not in harmony with that of <i>Patanjali</i>, who does not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः into this <i>sutra</i>. According to him गौशकटिक is formed from गोशकटी; and एकविंशति &c, do not take this affix, because it is against usage. But the author of <i>Kasika</i> says—अवश्यं चात इत्यनुवर्त्यम्; द्वन्द्वापतोपगर्ह्यात् इत्येवमाद्यर्थम् -- the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः must surely be read, for the sake of <i>sutras</i> like [[5.2.128]], though in the <i>sutras</i>, like वातातिसाराभ्यां &c there is no necessity of reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः) ॥\n\nThe word नित्यम् 'always', is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that मतुप् does not come in the alternative. In all the previous <i>sutras</i> मतुप् came in the alternative. How do you form एकद्रव्यवत् in एकद्रव्यवत्वाद् ? This is not a correct form; or it may be said to be a compound of एक and द्रव्यवत्वात् ॥",
    "52119": "Thus निष्कशतमस्यास्ति = नैष्कशतिकः, नैष्कसहस्रिकः ॥ But not so after सुवर्णनिष्कशतं, it being never so found in usage.",
    "52120": "Thus आहतं रूपमस्य = रूप्यो दीनारः 'a <i>Dinara</i> having stamped on it the form of some king &c'. रूप्यः केदारः, रूप्यं कार्षापणम्. Similarly प्रशस्तं रूपमस्यास्ति = रूप्यः पुरुषः 'a lovely person'. The form impressed on a <i>dinar</i> &c by hammering &c, is called आहत or stamping.\n\nWhy do we say 'when stamping or praise is denoted ?' Observe रूपवान् 'having form'.\n\nVart:- The affix यप् is seen after other words also, as हिम्याः पर्वताः, गुण्या ब्राह्मणाः ॥",
    "52121": "Thus पयस्-पयस्विन्, यशस्-यशस्विन् ॥ मायाविन्, मेधाविन्, स्रग्विन् ॥ The word माया being included in व्रीह्यादि class, will take इनि, and ठञ् also [[5.2.116]]. As मायी, मायिकः ॥",
    "52122": "As अग्ने तेजस्विन् ॥ Sometimes it is not added, as सूर्यो वर्चस्वान् ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, the finals अ of इय, उभय and हृदय is lengthened optionally before विनि; and it comes after अष्ट्रा, मेखला and रुजा also : as अष्ट्रावी, मेखलावी, इयावी, उभयावी, रुजावी, हृदयावी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after मर्म, as मर्मावी ॥\n\nVart:- Always after आमय, in the sacred as well as secular literature. As आमयावी ॥\nVart:- The affix आरकन् comes after शृङ्ग and वृन्द; as शृ꣡ङ्गारकः, वृ꣡न्दारकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इनच् comes after फल and बर्ह, as फलिनः꣡ and बर्हिणः꣡ ॥\n\nVart:- So also after हृदय; the affix चालु comes optionally: as, हृदयालुः, हृदयी, हृदयिकः, हृदयवान् ॥ The च् is इत् by [[1.3.7]].\n\nVart:- The affix आलुच् comes after शीत, उष्ण, and तृप, in the sense of not being able to bear that. As शीतं न सहते = शीतालुः 'shivering from cold'. उष्णालुः, तृपालुः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after हिम comes the affix एलु in the above sense: as हिमं न सहते = हिमेलुः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ऊलुच् in the same sense after बल; as बलं न सहते = बलूलः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after वात; as वातानां समूहः, or वातं न सहते = वातूलः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix तन् comes after पर्व and मरुत्. As प꣡र्वतः and म꣡रुत्तः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इनि comes after अर्थ in the sense of 'not having that' as अर्थी 'a beggar, who has not <i>artha</i> or wealth'. Otherwise अर्थवान् 'rich'. All these are obtained by बहुलः ॥",
    "52123": "The स् of युस् makes the word ऊर्णा a पद [[1.4.16]]; the result of which is that rules applicable to भ <i>Bha</i> do not apply; e. g. (VI. I. 148), by which the final इ or ई, अ or आ is elided. Thus ऊर्णायुः ॥ According to some; छन्दसि is to be read in this <i>sutra</i>. The author of <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i> says that this is reasonable; for if <i>yus</i> is added to <i>urna</i> in secular literature also, then there was no necessity of this <i>sutra</i>. The word <i>urna</i> could have been read along with <i>aham</i> and <i>subham</i> in [[5.2.140]].",
    "52124": "Thus वाग्मी, वाग्मिनौ, वाग्मिनः. The affix is not मिन्, for had it been so, the form would have been वाङ्मिन् by [[8.4.45]] <i>Vart</i>.",
    "52125": "This debars ग्मिन् ॥ Thus वाचालः 'garrulous', वाचाटः ॥\n\nVart:- These affixes come when contempt is expressed. An orator (वाग्मी) also talks much, but to the purpose. He will not be called वाचालः or वाचाटः ॥",
    "52126": "The affix आमिन् comes in the sense of lordship after the word स्व ॥ Thus स्वमस्यास्ति = ऐश्वर्यमस्यास्ति = स्वामिन् ॥ Why do we say when meaning 'Sir'. Observe, स्ववान् ॥",
    "52127": "Thus अर्शोसि अस्य विद्यन्ते = अर्शसः उरसः &c. ॥ After a word denoting a member of the body comes the affix अच्, when defect is meant. As खञ्जः पादोस्यास्ति = खञ्जः, काणः ॥ So also after words denoting color, as शुक्लोऽस्यास्ति = शुक्लः पटः ॥\n\n1 अर्शस्, 2 उरस्, 3 तुन्द, 4 चतुर, 5 पलित, 6 जटा, 7 घटा, 8 घाटा, 9 अघ (अभ्र), 10 कर्दम, 11 अम्ल (आम), 12 लवण, 13 स्वाङ्गाद्धीनात्, 14 वर्णात् आकृतिगण ॥",
    "52128": "Thus <i>Dvandva</i>:-- कटकवलयिनी 'a woman having a bracelet and a zone', शङ्खनूपुरिणी 'a woman having <i>sankha</i> and <i>nupur</i> ornaments'. So after diseases: कुष्ठी 'a leper', किलासी 'a white leper'. So after names of faults:- ककुदावर्ती, काकतालुकी ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when found in a living being ?' Observe पुष्पफलवान् वृक्षः ॥ The affix, according to a <i>Vartika</i>, does not come after words denoting members of a living body: as, पाणिपादवती ॥ The word अतः [[5.2.115]], is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the affix does not come after words not ending in अ; as चित्रकललाटिकावती ॥ Though <i>Dvandva</i> compounds &c. ending in अ, would have taken इनि by [[5.2.115]], the repetition of this affix in the present <i>sutra</i> shows that <i>Dvandva</i> compounds &c, take only इनि, and not ठन् &c.",
    "52129": "The words वात and अतिसार being names of diseases, will take इनि by the fore-going <i>sutra</i>; the present aphorism only teaches the affixing of the augment. Thus वातकी, अतिसारकी ॥ Another reading is अतीसारकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after पिशाच, as पिशाचकी वैश्रवणः 'the <i>Kubera</i>'.\n\nThis is when the words वात and अतिसार denote diseases. Otherwise, वातवती गुहा ॥",
    "52130": "Thus पञ्चमोऽस्यास्ति मासः संवत्सरो वा = पंचमिन् 'five months or years old', as पंचमी उष्ट्रः ॥ Similarly नवमी, दशमी &c. By [[5.2.115]] the affix इनि would have come after these words; the present <i>sutra</i> is a restrictive rule teaching that ठन् does not come in this sense.\n\nWhy do we say वयसि 'when age is denoted'? Observe, पंचमवान् ग्रामरागः ॥",
    "52131": "Thus सुखिन् nom. सुखी; दुःखिन् &c. When censure is implied, then इन् comes after माला, to the exclusion of मतुप्, as माली ॥\n\nThe following is the list of सुखादि word:-  \n\n1 सुख, 2 दुःख, 3 तृप्त, 4 कृच्छ, 5 आश्र (आम्र), 6 अस्र, 7 अलीक, 8 करुण (करुणा) 9 सोढ, 10 प्रतीप (प्रमीप), 11 शील,12 हल, 13 माला क्षेपे, 14 कृपण, 15 प्रणय (प्रणाय) 16 वल, 17 कक्ष ॥",

Thus in the affix दानीम् [[5.3.18]], म् is not इत्, had it been so, rule [[1.1.47]] would have applied: (b) to regulate the accent of इदम्, thus इदम् + तसिल् = इतः here by (VI. I. 171), the affix तसिल् becomes <i>udatta</i> by virtue of its being <i>Vibhakti</i>, othewise the accent would have been regulated by the indicatory ल् (VI.

The word किम् is a सर्वनाम, but it being included in the <i>dyadi</i> class, would have been exempted from the operation of this rule had it not been separately mentioned.\n\nVart:- The word बहु here is a <i>Sankhya</i>.

    "53016": "The words सप्तम्याः and काले are understood. This <i>rhil</i> debars <i>ha</i>. The ल् of र्हिल् is for accent. Thus अस्मिन् काले = एतर्हि [[5.3.4]] 'at this time'. Why 'when time is denoted'? Observe, इह 'in this place', as इह देशे ॥ See [[5.3.4]].",
    "53017": "As अस्मिन् काले = अधुना 'at this time' अश् is substituted for इदम् and, धुन affix is added.",

    "53020": "The affix दा comes after इदम् and र्हि after तद् ॥ Thus इदा [[5.3.3]], तर्हि [[7.2.102]]. So also इदानीम् and तदानीम् ॥ As इ॒॒दा हि य॒॒मुप॑स्तुतिभि॒॒दा वा॒॒मस्य॑ भ॒॒क्तये॑ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VIII. 27. 11).",
    "53021": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of छन्दसि is not read into this <i>sutra</i>. This is a general rule. Thus कर्हि or कदा [[7.2.103]], यर्हि or यदा, तर्हि or तदा ॥",
    "53022": "The words सप्तम्याः and काले are understood here. The base, the substitute, the affix, the particular time &c, must all be deduced from these forms. Thus सद्यः is formed from समान, by substituting स for समान, and adding the affix द्यस्; in the sense of 'a day'. समानेऽहनि = सद्यः 'the same day'. The पूर्व and पूर्वतर are replaced by पर, and then the affixes उत् and आरि are added, in the sense of 'a year'. Thus पूर्वस्मिन् संवत्सरे = परुत् 'last year'. पूर्वतरे संवत्सरे = परार 'the year belore last'. The इश replaces इदम्, and affix समतण् is added, in the sense of 'year'. Thus अस्मिन् संवत्सरे = ऐषमः 'during this years'. To पर is added एद्यवि in the sense of 'a day': as, परस्मिन्नहनि = परेद्यवि 'the other day'. The अद्य replaces इदम् and the affix द्यस् is added in the sense of 'a day'. Thus अस्मिन्नहनि = अद्य 'to day'. To the words पूर्व, अन्य, अन्यतर, इतर, अपर, अधर, उभय and उत्तर is added the affix एद्युस्, in the sense of 'a day': as पूर्वस्मिन्नहनि = पूर्वेद्युस् 'on the day before', अन्यस्मिन्नहनि = अन्येद्युस् 'on the following day'. अन्यतरस्मिन्नहनि = अन्यतरेद्युः 'on either of two days'. इतरस्मिन्नहनि = इतरेद्युः 'on another day', अपरस्मिन्नहनि = अपरेद्युः 'on the following day', अधरस्मिन्नहनि = अधरेद्युः 'on a previous day'. उभयोरहनोः = उभयेद्युः 'on both days'.",
    "53023": "The <i>sutra</i> [[5.3.2]], is to be read into this. The <i>anuvritti</i> of सप्तम्याः and काले ceases. The word प्रकार means the differentiating quality distinguishing a species among the genus : it means 'sort', 'kind', 'mode', 'manner' &c. Thus तेन प्रकारेण = तथा 'so, in that manner'. Similarly यथा, सर्वथा ॥ The affix जातीयर् taught in [[5.3.69]] has also the same force, with this difference that <i>jatiyar</i> applies to words which denote things possessing such a quality (प्रकारयाच्च, while <i>thal</i> denotes mode itself. Therefore, one does not debar the other, so that we have forms like, तथाजातीयः and यथाजातीयः ॥",
    "53024": "This debars थाल्; thus : अनेन प्रकारेण = इत्थम् [[5.3.4]] 'in this manner'. The उ in थमु protects the  म् from becoming इत् (See [[1.3.4]]).",
    "53025": "Thus केन प्रकारेण = कथम् 'how?'.",
    "53026": "The word प्रकार वचने is read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of च ॥ Thus कथा 'wherefore? why? for what reason?', कथा 'how'. The former is an example of हेतु 'reason or cause', the second of प्रकार 'manner'. As in the following sentences : कथा ग्रामं न पृच्छसि = केन हेतुना ग्रामं न पृच्छसि ॥ कथा देवा आसन् पुराविदः ॥\n\nHere end the affixes having the designation of <i>Vibhakti</i>.",

Similarly with अधस्तात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'after words of direction'? Observe ऐन्द्र्यां दिशि वसति ॥ Why do we say 'ending in the locative, ablative and nominative'? Observe पूर्वम् ग्रामं गतः ॥ Why do we say when the sense is 'a direction', 'a locality' or 'a time'? Observe पूर्वस्मिन् गुरौ वसति 'he lives in the presence of the <i>guru</i>'.\n\nThis affix is a स्वार्थिक affix, like the affixes taught previously. The words denoting direction must be primitive words of direction; and not derivative words like ऐन्द्री &c. which also denote direction. The rule of यथासंख्य does not apply here.",

The च् serves the purpose of differentiating this आ from other affixes in <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.29]].",
    "53037": "Thus दक्षिणाहि वसति or दक्षिणा वसति 'he lives far away in the south'. Similarly दक्षिणाहिं रमनायम्, दक्षिणा रमणीयम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say दूरे 'when the adverb denotes a distant limit'? Observe दक्षिणतो वसति ॥ The word अपञ्चम्याः governs this also: as, दक्षिणत आगतः ॥",
    "53038": "Thus उत्तरा or उत्तराहि वसति or रमणीयम् \"He lives far away in the north: or the northward far away is pleasant\". But when 'distance' is not meant we have उत्तरेण प्रयाति ॥ The word governs this also: as उत्तरादागतः ॥",
    "53039": "The word अपञ्चम्याः does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. Thus पुरो वसति, पुर आगतः, पुरो रमणीयम् ॥   Similarly अधस् and अवस् with वसति, आगतः and रमणीयम् ॥ As अधोवसति अध-आगतः, अधोरमणीयम्, अवोवसति, अवआगतः and अवोरमणीयम् ॥",
    "53040": "That is पुर् for पूर्व, अध् for अधर and अव् for अवर ॥ This <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication that the affix अस्ताति [[5.3.27]] is not debarred by अस् after these words. Thus पुरस्तात् or अधस्तात् or अवस्तात् वसति or आगतः or रमणीयम् ॥",

    "53043": "The word संख्यायाः is understood here. The word अधिकरणं means 'matter, stuff, substance'.  विचालः 'change in numbers'. Thus to make one into many, or to make many into one. Thus एकं राशिं कुरु 'divide one heap into five'. अष्टधा कुरु, अनेकमेकधा कुरु ॥",
    "53044": "Thus एकधा राशिं कुरु or ऐकध्यं कुरु, एकधा भुङ्क्ते or ऐकध्यं भुङ्क्ते ॥ The repetition of धा in the <i>sutra</i> shows that the substitution takes place when the sense is that of विधा, as well as when it is that of अधिकरण विचाल ॥ Had धा not been repeated, the substitution would have come in the sense of अधिकरण विचाल only, as immediately preceding this <i>sutra</i>.",
    "53045": "Here also it comes in both the विधार्थ and अधिकरण विचाल senses. By च, the word 'optionally' is drawn into the <i>sutra</i>.

    "53048": "This <i>sutra</i> is made only to teach accent, for the word to which अन् is added undergoes no other change of form except in accent. Thus द्विती꣡यः [[5.2.54]] has <i>udatta</i> on ती [[3.1.3]] but when अन् is added, the accent falls on द्वि (VI. I. 197). Thus द्वितीयो भागः = द्वि꣡तीयः 'the moiety'. Similarly तृ꣡तीयः 'the one-third'. Why do we say when 'part' is meant? Otherwise, there is no change in accent. The affix तीय always comes in forming ordinal numbers and for no other purpose, for the तीय in words like मुखतीय is not significant as it is not an affix. The employment of the word पूरण in the aphorism is useless for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>. Its <i>anuvritti</i>, however, runs in the other <i>sutras</i>, and that is the only purpose that it serves here.",
    "53049": "This is for accent also. Thus च꣡तुर्थः, प꣡ञ्चमः, स꣡प्तमः, न꣡वमः, द꣡शमः ॥ Why do we say प्रागेकादशः 'before eleven'? Observe एकादशः꣡, द्वादशः꣡ no change of accent [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say 'not in the <i>Chhandas</i>'? Observe, पञ्चममिन्द्रियस्यापाक्रामत (पञ्चम꣡ has acute on the final being formed by डट् preceded by मट् [[5.2.48]], [[5.2.49]].",
    "53050": "The words भागे and अछन्दसि are understood here. By च, the affix अन् is included. Thus ष꣡ष्ठः or षा꣡ष्ठः, अ꣡ष्टमः or आ꣡ष्टमः ॥",
    "53051": "The word मान means a grain weight (व्रीहि परिमितं सुवर्ण). That is to say, कन् comes after षष्ठ when a division of मान 'measure' is expressed; and लुक् comes after अष्ट when a part of पश्वङ्ग is denoted. Thus ष꣡ष्ठको भागः 'a sixth of a grain measure'. अष्टमो भागः 'an-eighth part of the body of a beast'. The लुक् here takes the place of the affix ञ as well as अन् ॥ By च, the affixes above mentioned are also employed: as षाष्ठः or षष्ठः, आष्टमः or अष्टमः ॥ When a measure or the body of an animal is not denoted, this rule (though optional) will not apply.",
    "53052": "By the word च, the affix कन् and the elision लुक् also take effect: the elision being of कन् or आकिनिच् ॥ Thus एकाकिन् (nom. एकाकी), एककः or एकः ॥ By using असहाय, it is indicated that the word एक here is not a numeral meaning 'one', but a noun meaning 'alone'. एकोऽन्यार्थे प्रधाने च, प्रथमे, केवले तथा ॥ साधारणे, समानेऽल्पे, संख्यायां च प्रयुज्यते ॥ So that this word will have dual एकाकिनौ, and the plural एकाकिनः ॥",
    "53053": "The word भूतपूर्व is a compound of पूर्व and भूतः the compounding being by सुप्सुपा, and denotes something done in a past time. Thus आढ्यो भतपूर्वः = आढ्यचरः 'once opulent'. सुकुमारचरः ॥ The ट् indicates that the feminine will be in ङीप्; as, आढ्यचरी ॥ The च् is not इत् in चरट् though required by (1. 3. 7). This proves that चुटु rule is <i>anitya</i>. The <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.18]] might have been read after this, with the saving of the word भूतपूर्वः, but then खञ् would have debarred चरट् which is, however, not intended.",
    "53054": "The word भूतपूर्व here qualifies the sense of the affix, and not the sense of the base, as it in the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus देवदत्तस्य भूतपूर्वो गौः = देवदत्तरूप्यः 'the cow that formerly belonged to <i>Devadatta</i>'. Similarly देवदत्तचरः ॥",
    "53055": "These affixes form the superlative degree. The word अतिशायन is an irregular form of अतिशयनं, and it qualifies the sense of the primitive. The स्वार्थिक affixes sometimes qualify the sense of the primitive. Thus आढ्यतमः = सर्व इमे आढ्याः, अयमेषामतिशयेनाढ्यः 'the richest' i. e. 'these are all rich, but he surpasses them all in riches'. Similarly दर्शनीयतमः 'most handsome'. सुकुमारतमः &c. Similarly पटु-पटिष्ठः, गुरु-गरिष्ठः, लघु-लघिष्ठः [[6.4.155]]. When among superlatives, further excellence is indicated, then these words may take additional affixes : as श्रेष्ठ, though a superlative, forms श्रेष्ठतमः ॥ As देवो वः सविता प्रार्पयतु श्रेष्ठतमाय कर्मणे । युधिष्ठिरः श्रेष्ठतमः कुरूणामिति ॥",
    "53056": "By ङ्याप्प्रातिपदिकात् (IV. I. I) whose force runs throughout, the <i>taddhita</i> affixes are ordained only after nominal stems; they would not have come after verbs, hence this <i>sutra</i>. Thus पचतितमाम् (the आम् is added by [[5.4.11]] = सर्व इमे पचन्तीति, अयमेषामतिशयेन पचति, 'he cooks surprisingly'. जल्पतितमाम् &c. The affix इष्ठन् never comes after a verb, as by [[5.3.58]], it is restricted to adjectives.",
    "53057": "The word द्विवचन does not mean 'dual', but means an expression for two. विभज्य is irregularly formed by यत्, and means 'that which is to be distinguished or differentiated'. This debars तमप् and इष्ठन् ॥ The rule of यथासंख्य [[1.3.10]] does not apply here. First to take an example of द्विवचन or when comparison is between two things : thus: द्वाविमावाढ्यौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन = आढ्यतरः 'both are rich, but he is richer amongst the two'. Similarly सुकुमारतरः, पचतितराम्, जल्पतितराम् [[5.4.11]]: or with इयसुन् : as, द्वाविमौ पटू, अयमनयोरतिशयेन पटुः = पटीयान् 'more skillful of the two', लघीयान् ॥ Secondly to take an example of विभज्यते चोपपदे i.e. when a word in construction is to be differentiated: thus माथुराः पाटलिपुत्रकेभ्य आढ्यतराः 'The men of <i>Mathura</i> are richer than those of <i>Pataliputra</i>'. Here there are more than two things, but as the words are expressed in the sentence, the comparative degree in plural number is used. Similarly दर्शनीयतराः, पटीयांसः, लघीयांसः ॥ Of course all these words must be plural, as they refer to more than two persons.",
    "53058": "The affixes इष्ठन् and ईयसुन् are restricted in their scope by this <i>sutra</i> i. e. they come only after adjectives or adverbs, in expressing comparative and superlative degrees. Thus लघीयान् , लघिष्टः, पटीयान्, पटिष्टः; but not after words like पाचक &c. There we have पाचकतरः, पाचकतमः ॥ The word एव 'only' restricts the scope of the affixes, and not of the primitives. Thus पटुतरः, पटुतमः are also valid forms.",
    "53059": "The तुः is ablative of तृ which includes both तृन् and तृच् ॥ This extends the application of these affixes to words other than attributes. Thus अतिशयेन कर्ता = करिष्ठः (कर्तृ + इष्ठन् = कर् + इष्ठ by [[6.4.154]], तृ is elided) As आसुर्ति करिष्ठः, दोहीयसी धेनुः ॥ By <i>Vartika</i> under [[6.3.35]] दोहित्री is changed into masculine दोहितृ and then ईयस् is added, when तृ is elided by [[6.4.154]].",
    "53060": "Though प्रशस्य is not an attribute, it takes these affixes by the application of this rule. The <i>anuvritti</i> of अजादी runs here, but the word must be changed into locative for the purposes of this aphorism, and which will read thus प्रशस्यस्य श्रोऽजाद्योः ॥ Thus सर्व इमे प्रशस्या अयमेषामतिशयेन प्रशस्यः = श्रेष्ठः, उभाविमौ प्रशस्यौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन प्रशस्यः = श्रेयान् ॥ Rule [[6.4.163]] prevents the elision of the अ of श्र, which otherwise would have been elided by [[6.4.148]] and [[5.4.155]]. These words are equal to प्रशस्यतरः and प्रशस्यतमः ॥",
    "53061": "As ज्येष्ठः, ज्यायान् (आ is substituted for the ई of ईयस् by [[6.4.160]]).",
    "53062": "Thus ज्येष्ठः 'the oldest', ज्यायान् 'the older'. By [[6.4.157]], वर्षि is also substituted for वृद्ध; and we have वर्षीष्ठः and वर्षीयान् also. The word वृद्ध though not a <i>gunavachana</i>, takes these affixes by the implication of this <i>sutra</i>.",
    "53063": "Thus नेदिष्ठम्, नेदीयः, साधिष्ठः and साधीयान् ॥ सर्वाणीमान्यन्तिकानि इदमेषामतिशयेन, नेदिष्टम् । उभे इमे अन्तिके इदमनयोरतिशयेन नेदीयः । इदमस्मान्नेदीयः । सर्वइमे बाढमधीयते । अयमस्मात्साधीयोधीते ॥",
    "53064": "Thus कनिष्ठः, कनीयान् or यविष्ठः, यवीयान्; similarly अल्पिष्ठ, अल्पीयान्, or कनिष्ठः, कनीयान् ॥ सर्वइमे युवानः, अयमेषामतिशयेन, कनिष्ठः । द्वाविमौ युवानौ अयमनयोरतिशयेन, कनीयान् । यविष्टः । यवीयान् । सर्वइमेऽल्पाः । अयमेषामतिशयेन, कनिष्ठः । उभाविमावल्पावयमनयोरतिशयेन कनीयान् । अयमस्मात्कनीयान् । अल्पिष्ठः अल्पीयानिति वा ॥",

    "53066": "The word प्रशंसा means 'praise', and it qualifies the sense of the primitive; i. e. when the sense of the primitive is that of 'praise', then रूपप् is added. As a general rule the स्वार्थिक affixes, which do not change the denotation of the word, serve the purpose of prominently bringing forward one particular meaning out of the several meanings possessed by a primitive. Thus प्रशस्तो वैयाकरणः = वैयाकरणरूपः 'a celebrated Grammarian'. So also याज्ञिकरूपः ॥ The praise may be implied by the sense of the primitive, without being absolute praise: thus चोररूपः 'a celebrated thief', दस्युरूपः 'a celebrated robber'; a person very expert in his evil courses even; these word being applied to a thief who is so dexterous that he can steal 'the collyrium from the eye-lashes', or 'a horse from under the rider', without the latter being aware of it.\n\nThe affix comes after a verbal word ending in तिङ्, for the word तिङश्च [[5.3.56]] is understood here also. Thus पचतिरूपम्, पचतोरूपम् or पचन्तिरूपम् 'who is celebrated, who two are celebrated or who all are celebrated in cooking'. These words पचतिरूपम् &c cannot take dual or plural; because the action denoted by the verb is only one, not many. These words are always in the neuter gender, by the general usage of the people.",
    "53067": "The word समाप्ति means 'fullness of objects'. A little non-fullness is called ईषदसमाप्ति ॥ Thus पटुकल्पः, पटुदेश्यः or पटुदेशीयः 'clever but slightly incomplete' i. e. 'tolerably clever'. मृदुकल्पः, मृदुदेश्यः, मृदुदेशीयः ॥ So also after verbs, as पचतिकल्पम्, जल्पतिकल्पम् ॥ &c.",
    "53068": "This is the only exception to the general rule that an affix is added after a word. The affix बहुच् however is added before the word. The च् of बहुच् indicates that the <i>udatta</i> will fall on the final vowel of the word. See (VI. I. 163). Thus बहुपटुः꣡ 'a tolerably skillful person'. बहुमृदुः꣡, बहुगुडा꣡ दाक्षाः ॥ By the word 'optionally' it is indicated that the affixes कल्प &c also come. By using the word सुपः 'to a noun ending in a case-affix i. e a declined noun', it is indicated that the affix is not added to finite verbs (तिङन्त) ॥",
    "53069": "That which distinguishes one thing from another is called प्रकार or 'speciality'. When a word expresses speciality, it is called प्रकारवचनः ॥ This word qualifies the sense of the primitive. The affix जातीयर् and the affix याल् [[5.3.23]] both denote प्रकार, but while जातीयर् denotes प्रकारवान्, the other denotes प्रकारमात्र i. e. merely प्रकार ॥\n\nThus पटुजातीयः 'he may be reckoned among the clever persons'. So also मृदुजातीयः, दर्शनीयजातीयः ॥  \n\nThe above <i>Sutra</i> may, therefore, be translated in these words also, \"the affix जातीय has the sense of \"belonging to the class of\", \"being of the nature of\".",
    "53070": "Properly speaking क extends only upto [[5.3.86]]. Thus in the <i>sutra</i> अज्ञाते [[5.3.73]], the word क must be supplied to complete the sense. As अश्वकः, गर्दभकः ॥ This affix क does not come after finite verbs (तिङन्त), but the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]] comes after such verbs. In other words, the phrase तिङश्च [[5.3.56]], should be connected, by way of <i>anuvritti</i>, with the next <i>sutra</i>, and not with this.",
    "53071": "The च् shows that the acute accent falls on the final [[6.1.163]], though the affix is inserted in the middle of the word. The phrase तिङश्च [[5.3.56]] is understood here also. This अकच् debars क ॥ Thus उच्चैः + अक् = उच्च् + अक् + ऐः = उच्च॒॒कैः; similarly नीच॒॒कैः, शमकैः from नीचैः and शनैः ॥ So also after Pronominals, as सर्वके, विश्वके and उभयके from सर्वे, विश्वे and उभये ॥ In these last examples, it will be seen that the affix is added to सुबन्त words i.e. to declined nouns, and not to प्रातिपदिक or crude-noun: as was required by [[4.1.1]]. Sometimes, however, the affix is added after a <i>Pratipadika</i> also. The usage will determine when the affix should be added to a Nominal stem (<i>Pratipadika</i>) and when to a <i>Subanta</i> word. Thus in युष्मकाभिः, अस्मकाभिः, युष्मकासु, अस्मकासु, युवकयोः, आवकयोः, the affix is added to <i>pratipadika</i> viz to युष्मद्, अस्मद्, giving युष्मकद्, अस्मकद् which are then declined as Pronominals. But in the examples त्वयका, मयका त्वयकि, मयकि, the affix अक् is added to the त्वया, मया (the Instrumental case of युष्मद् and अस्मद्), and त्वयि and मयि the Locative singular of the same. From the above examples, this rule may be deduced; the affix अक् is added to the <i>Pradipadika</i>, when case-affixes beginning with ओ, स or भ follows; and the affix is added to the declined pronoun, in the remaining cases.\n\nVart:- The affix काम् is added to the Indeclinable तूष्णीम् ॥ The म् is indicatory, therefore, का comes before the final vowel (1. 1.47). As तूष्णीम् + का = तूष्णीकाम्, as तूष्णीकामास्ते, तूष्णीकां तिष्ठति 'he remained silent'. When, however, the meaning in that 'whose habit is so', then the affix क is added, and the म् of तूष्णीम् is elided. As तूष्णीकः 'a taciturn'.\n\nThe phrase तिङश्च [[5.3.56]] being understood here, the affix अक् comes after finite verbs also. As पचति-पचतकि, जल्पति-जल्पतकि ॥",
    "53072": "The word अव्यय is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> and not सर्वनाम, because no Pronominal ends in क् ॥ Thus धकित्, हिरकुत् and पृथकत् from धिक्, हिरुक् and पृथक् ॥ Thus हिरुक् + अक् = हिर् + अक् + उक् = हिरकुत्, now comes the present rule and the final क् is changed into द्, as हिरकुद् or त् ॥",
    "53073": "This अज्ञात or want of knowledge refers not to the object itself, but to its relation with some other object. As अश्वकः 'whose horse?' गर्दभकः 'the ass' (of whom is this)? उष्ट्रकः &c. Similarly in उच्चकैः 'high' (is it so?) नीचकैः 'Is it low'? सर्वके 'was this agreed to by all'? So also विश्वके ॥ Similarly पचतकि \"He cooks, is it?\" जल्पतकि 'He speaks, does he?'",
    "53074": "Thus अश्वकः 'a sorry horse'. उष्ट्रकः, गर्दभकः, उच्चकैः, नीचकैः सर्वके, विश्वक ॥ पचतकि 'he cooks comtemptibly'. जल्पतकि 'he speaks insignificantly'.",
    "53075": "The word कुत्सिते of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. This कन् debars क ॥ शुद्रकः, धारकः, चूर्णकः ॥",
    "53076": "The word अनुकम्पा means  'compassion, pity, endearment'. Thus पुत्रकः 'the little child', 'poor child'. वत्सकः, दुर्बलकः, बुभुक्षिकः, विश्वसितकि 'fie ! he trusts'. स्वपितकि 'alas ! he sleeps'. The two latter are examples of finite verbs taking this affix.",
    "53077": "The word नीति means 'policy' or 'expedient', such as 'conciliation', 'dissension' and 'punishment'. तद्युक्तात् means 'joined with that, i.e. with gift compassion'. In other words, the things signified by the bases, are connected as means of relief with the persons or things that have been objects of compassion. Thus, हन्त ते धानकाः 'alas! here are barley for you'. हन्त ते तिलकाः 'alas! here are sesamun for you'. एहकि, अद्धकि 'O dear! come and eat'. (These words are supposed to be addressed to a person who is starving, by one who wants to relieve him. <i>Iyengar</i>). Being moved with compassion, he entreats coursteously the object of sympathy, with gifts to relieve his want. In the last <i>Sutra</i>, the affix was added, in the sense of compassion, to the name of the person or action that evoked pity. In the present <i>sutra</i>, the affix is added to the object or action by which pity is shown. The word एहकि is from एहि the Imperative second person Singular of इ 'to go' with the <i>upasarga</i> आ ॥",
    "53078": "In the alternative we have कन् also. As अनुकम्पितो देवदत्तः = देविकः (देवदत्त + इक = देव + इक) [[5.3.83]]. When कन् is added there is no shortening of the base, as देवदत्तकः ॥ Similarly यज्ञिकः or यज्ञदत्तकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say बह्वचः 'after a polysyllable?' Observe दत्तकः, गुप्तकः ॥ Why do we say 'being a Man-name'? Observe मद्रबाहुकः, भद्रबाहुकः which are epithets and not Proper Nouns (मद्रौ बाहू यस्य); or these are names of quadrupeds.",
    "53079": "The force of च is that the other affix कन् also comes, as well as ठच् ॥ Thus from देवदत्त we have: देवियः, देविलः, देविकः, देवदत्तकः ॥ So from यज्ञदत्तः—यज्ञिकः, यज्ञिलः यज्ञिकः, यज्ञदत्तकः ॥ [[5.3.83]].",
    "53080": "The च shows that the former affixes also come. The sense of the affixes are the same as above viz. compassion or courtesy. Thus from the word उपेन्द्रदत्त, we have, 1. उपेन्द्रदत्तकः (<i>kan</i>), उपिकः (<i>thach</i>), 3, उपिलः (<i>ilach</i>), 4. उपियः (<i>ghan</i>), 5. उपकः (<i>vuch</i>), 6. उपडः (<i>adach</i>). The shortened forms are by [[5.3.83]]. In diminutives, the forms are generally shortened. The word प्राचां is used as a sign of respect (<i>pujartha</i>), for the word वा was understood in the aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[5.3.78]].",
    "53081": "The जातिनामन् are words like व्याघ्र &c which are well-known names of particular species of animals &c, but which are come to be applied to men by way of metaphor. The <i>anuvritti</i> of बह्वचः does not extend to it. This is a general rule. Thus व्याघ्रकः, सिंहकः, शरमकः ॥ The word वा being understood in the <i>sutra</i>, the previous affixes also come, as, व्याघ्रिलः, सिंहिलः ॥ The word नामन् is used along with जाति, to prevent the affix being added to the word-form जाति (1. 1. 68).",
    "53082": "The words कन् and मनुष्यनाम्नः are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus व्याघ्रकः from व्याघ्राजिनः, and सिंहकः from सिंहाजिनः ॥ <i>Vyaghrajina</i> and <i>Sinhajina</i> are names of men.",
    "53083": "<i>Karika</i>\n\nचतुर्थादनजादौ च लोपः पूर्वपदस्य च ।\nअप्रत्यये तथैवेष्ट उवर्णाल्ल इलस्य च ॥\n\nThe word लोप is understood here from the last <i>sutra</i> The word ऊर्द्ध्वम् indicates that the whole of that portion of the term which follows the second vowel should be elided, otherwise, only the first letter of the third syllable would have been elided by (1. 1. 54). The illustrations have been given above. Thus देवदत्त + इक; here all the letters after the अ of देव should be elided : as देविकः, so also देवियः, देविलः ॥\n\nThe affix ठ is replaced by इक् or क [[7.3.50]] and [[7.3.51]] hence its special mention in this <i>sutra</i>. For had it not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus. 'When an affix beginning with a vowel follows &c'. This rule would have applied to इक substitute of ठ, but not to क substitute of ठ which comes after words ending in उ, ऋ, त्, इस् and उस् ॥ But it is intended that क (and not इक) substitute of ठ should be added to words whose second syllables end in उक् (उ or ऋ) vowels. If it be said that इक substitute of ठ would be sufficient for words like वायुदत्त &c. also as it will cause the elision of the third and subsequent syllables; and when such syllables are elided, क would be the proper substitute to add to वायु and not इक, which we can do by the rule of <i>sthanivat</i>; we say, it is not so. For if it were the case, we should add the क substitute and not इक in the following: मथित + ठक् [[6.4.51]]= मथित् + ठक् [[6.4.148]], because, after elision, मथित् ends with त् ॥ But we know that क is not added but इक, and we have मथितिकः ॥ Hence the emplyment if ठ in the <i>sutra</i> is proper as वायुदत्तः—वायुकः, पितृदत्तः-पितृकः ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the portion after the fourth vowel is elided in certain cases. As अनुकम्पितो बृहस्पतिदत्तः-बृहस्पतिकः, बृहस्पतियः, बृहस्पतिलः ॥\n\nVart:- When an affix not beginning with a vowel follows, the elision is optional. Thus देवदत्त + कन् = देवदत्तकः or देवकः, यज्ञदत्तकः or यज्ञकः ॥\n\nVart:- There is elision of the first term, when these affixes ठच् &c denoting compassion, whether beginning with vowel or not, follow. Thus दत्तिकः, दत्तिलः, दत्तियः, दत्तकः from देवदत्त or यज्ञदत्त or वायुदत्त &c.\n\nVart:- The dimunitive of compassion or endearment may be formed without adding any affix, by simply dropping either the first or the second term of the name. Thus दत्तः or देव from देवदत्तः, सत्यभामा—भामा & सत्या ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इल is replaced by ल after a word ending in उ as, भानुलः from भानुदत्तः, वसुलः—वसुदत्तः ॥ So also after a word ending in ऋ as सवितृलः ॥\n\nVart:- When the second vowel is ओ, औ, ए or ऐ, then this is also elided. As लहिकः from लहोडः, कहिकः from कहोडः ॥\n\nVart:- When the first member consists of a single syllable, there is elision of the second member : as वाचिकः from वागीशाः (the ग् changed back to च् because the stem is now भ and not पद, and rule [[8.2.39]] does not apply.) So also; स्रुचिकः, त्वचिकः ॥ The form षडिकः (and not षषिकः from षष्) is an exception. It is dimunitive of षडङ्गुलिदत्तः ॥",
    "53084": "This debars the previous <i>sutra</i>. Thus अनुकम्पितः शेवलदत्तः = शेवलिकः, शेवलियः, शेवलिलः, सुपरिकः, सुपरियः, सुपरिलः from सुपरिदत्तः; so also विशालिकः, विशालियः, विशालिलः, वरुणिकः, वरुणियः, वरुनिलः, अर्यमिकः, अर्यमियः, and अर्यमिलः ॥\n\nVart:- The third vowel must be the original third vowel, and not that which results from <i>Sandhi</i>. Thus in शेवलेन्द्रदत्तः and सुपार्याशीर्दत्तः; though the apparent third vowels are ए and आ, but they being the result of compounding between शेवल + इन्द्र and सुपारि + आशीस्; the original vowels are taken. Thus शेवलिकः from शेवलेन्द्रदतः, and सुपरिकः from सुपार्याशीर्दत्तः; and not शवलेयिकः and सुपयिकः ॥",
    "53085": "Thus अल्पं तैलं = तैलकं 'a little oil'. सर्वकम्, घृतकम्, विश्वकम्, उच्चकैः, नीचकैः 'a somewhat high, a somewhat low &c'. पचतकि 'he cooks a little'. जल्पतकि 'he speaks somewhat'.",

    "53087": "Thus वंशकः, वेणुकः, दण्डकः ॥ This debars क ॥",
    "53088": "The word हृस्व is understood here, but not संज्ञा ॥ This debars क [[5.3.90]]. Thus हृस्वा कुटी = कुटीरः, शमीरः and शुण्डारः ॥ The derivatives are masculine names; though the primitives are feminine.",
    "53089": "This debars क ॥ Thus कुतुपः, from कुतू the long ऊ being elided owing to ड ॥ It means a small leathern vessel for oil. This word is neuter also, as, कुतुपम् ॥",
    "53090": "Thus हृस्वा कासूः = कासूतरी 'a small lance'; गोणीतरी 'a small sack'.",
    "53091": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of हृस्व ceases. Thus वत्सतरः 'a weaned calf' becoming slender in reaching the second period of its age. उक्षतरः 'a slender bull': being the third age of a वत्स ॥ अश्वतरः 'a mule': (तस्य तनुत्वमन्यपितृकता); वृषभतरः 'a slender bull or that cannot draw the load'.",
    "53092": "This affix comes in the <i>svartha</i> sense. The differentiation of a portion from the whole by means of its peculiar caste, action, attribute or name is called निर्द्धारण or specification. Thus कतरो भवतोः कठः 'amongst you two, who is <i>Katha</i>'. कतरो भवतोः कारकः 'amongst you two, who is the agent'. कतरो भवतोः पटुः 'amongst you two, who is clever'. कतरो भवतोः देवदत्तः 'which of the two amongst you is <i>Devadatta</i>'. Similarly यतरः 'of the two the one who', ततरः 'of the two--that one'. as यतरो भवतो देवदत्तः, ततर आगच्छतु 'of the two, let that one who is <i>Devadatta</i>, come'. The <i>taddhita</i> affixes being optional [[4.1.82]], this idea may be expressed by a sentence also. As, को भवतो देवदत्तः, स आगच्छतु 'who amongst you two is <i>Devadatta</i>, let him come'.",
    "53093": "The words किंयत्तदः and निरर्धारणे एकस्य are to be read into the <i>sutra</i>. Thus कतमो भवतां कठः 'which of you, Sirs, is a <i>Katha</i> <i>Brahmana</i>?' यतमो भवतां कठः, ततम आगच्छतु 'that one of you, Sirs, who is a <i>Katha</i>, let him come'. The word वा 'optionally' indicates that the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]] also comes, as यको भवतां कठः, तकः, आगच्छतु ॥ This idea may be expressed by a sentence also, owing to the महाविभाषा [[4.1.82]]: as, को भवतां कठः; यो भवतां कठः, स आगच्छतु ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when question is that of caste'? Observe, को भवतां देवदत्तः. Here the question is about a Name: and not <i>jati</i>. The word परिप्रश्न applies to किम् only, the pronouns यत् and तत् not being interrogative pronouns. But the word जाति applies to all these three pronouns.\n\nAccording to some, the affix डतर has also this force, after the word किम्, as, कतरो भवतां कठः 'which of you, Sirs, is a <i>Katha</i> <i>Brahmana</i>?' कतरो भवतां कलापः. As may be inferred from the <i>sutra</i> कतरकतमौ जातिपरिप्रश्ने [[4.1.63]]",
    "53094": "The च draws in डतरच् ॥ That is डतरच् comes when one out of two is to be specified; and डतमच् when one out of many is to be specified. The word जातिपरिप्रश्ने does not govern this <i>sutra</i>: it being a general rule. Thus एकतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः, एकतमो भवतां देवदत्तः ॥\n\nThe word प्राचाम् is for <i>pujartha</i>; the word वा being already understood in the <i>sutra</i>.",
    "53095": "Thus व्याकरणकः 'Grammar' used in a derisive sense, when its study produces pride. As व्याकरणकेन नाम त्वं गर्वितः 'thou art proud, because thou hast read grammar only'. याज्ञिक्यकेन नाम त्वं गर्वितः ॥ Here the words व्याकरणक and याज्ञिक्यक are used in a mocking sense. When, however, the derision applies to the person itself, then कन् is added by [[5.3.14]]: as देवदत्तकः &c. \n\nSo far the governing power of क [[5.3.70]].",

Thus <i>Devadatta</i> happens to enter a village, and on that very day, robbers happen to attack the village, and in the fray, <i>Devadatta</i> is killed, this coincidence of the robbers and <i>Devadatta</i> is called काकतालीयसमागमः, and the killing of <i>Devadatta</i> is like that of the crow by the ताल fruit. The first case of समागमः will form the compound, the second case of वधः will give rise to the affixing of छ, as काकतालीयो देवदत्तस्य वधः (the compound काकताल meaning काकतालसमागमसदृशश्चोर समागमः) and the derivative word काकतालीय meaning काकमरणसदृशः) :\n\nSimilarly अजाकृपाणीय means \"like the death of a goat (<i>aja</i>) by the accidental falling of a sword (<i>kripana</i>) as the goat was passing\". Similarly अन्धकवर्त्तकीय means \"like the accidental falling of a vulture (<i>vartika</i>) in to the hands of a blind person who thus captures it\".

The repetition of the word लोप in this rule, therefore, indicates that the elision ordained here is not one caused by the affix. For if the elision had been caused by the affix, then by [[1.1.57]], such लोपादेश or \"substitute\" would be equivalent to the principal (<i>sthanivat</i>); and would thus debar the application of the rule [[6.4.130]] by which पाद् <i>pad</i> (and not <i>pada</i>) is changed into पद् ॥ In other words, the <i>lopa</i> taught by यस्येति च is परनिमित्तक or caused by some thing which is subsequent, namely by a <i>taddhita</i> affix or by इ or ई affix; therefore, this <i>lopa</i> would be <i>sthani</i>-<i>vat</i> for the purposes of the rule which would apply to something preceding it (1. 1. 57). Therefore, <i>pad</i> becomes <i>sthani</i>-<i>vat</i> to <i>pada</i>. Therefore, the <i>anga</i> or base ending with '<i>pada</i>' will be called भ, and not the base ending with '<i>pad</i>', and therefore [[6.4.130]] which applies to भ bases will not apply, and there will be no substitution of पद् for पाद्, as there is not in the form पादाय. But we want such substitution and hence the employment of words \"the final of the stem is elided\".\n\nThus द्वौ द्वौ पादौ ददाति \"he gives two quarters to each\" = द्विपदिकां ददाति (द्विपाद + वुन् = द्विपाद् + वुन् = द्विपत् + वुन्) [[6.4.130]] = द्विपदिका [[7.3.44]] by which अ of अक् is changed into इ). Similarly द्वे द्वे शते ददाति = द्विशतिकां ददाति ॥\n\nThe compounds above formed are <i>taddhitartha</i> <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds, viz. compounds containing the sense of a <i>taddhita</i> affix, by rule (II. I. 51). After the compound is formed, then the affix वुन् is added. Thus first we have द्विपाद and द्विशत compounded by (II. I. 51) and then the affix is added. The words पाद and शत when not so compounded, take वुन् affix only in the feminine.\n\nWhy do we say \"of the words पाद and शत\"? Observe द्वौ द्वौ माषौ ददाति, no affixing. Why do we say \"preceded by a numeral?\" Observe पादं पादं ददाति ॥ Why do we say \"in a distributive sense\"?  Observe द्वौपादौ ददाति \"He gives two quarters:\" द्वे शते ददाति ॥\n\nThe enumeration of पाद and शत is useless, as the affix is found after other words also.

This <i>sutra</i> is begun to show that the \"distributive sense\" does not apply here. Thus द्वौ पादौ दण्डितः = द्विपदिकाम् दाण्डितः \"punished with the infliction of a fine of two <i>Padas</i>\" (a quarter coin)\". द्वौ पादौ व्यवसृजति = द्विपदिकां व्यवसृजात \"he makes a gift of two <i>Padas</i>\".

The word कृष्ण takes कन् when <i>tila</i> is meant; as कृष्णप्रकारास्तिला = कृष्णकाः ॥ यव takes कन् when meaning व्रीहि, as यवकाः ॥ इक्षु, तिल, पाद्य, काल,  and अवदात take this affix when wine is meant, a पाद्यिका, कालिका, अवदातिका \"a kind of wine\".  गोमूत्र takes this affix when meaning a covering, as गोमूत्रकः 'a covering of the colour of cow's wine, or <i>go</i>-<i>mutra</i> may mean a certain arrangement of colours such as white and black\". सुरा takes कन् meaning a snake, as सुरकः [[7.4.13]] \"a kind of snake of the color of wine\". जीर्ण takes it when meaning <i>sali</i> grain, as जीर्णकाः = जीर्णकल्पा शालयः ॥ The following is a list of <i>Sthuladi</i> words.\n\n1 स्थूल, 2 अणु, 3 माष, 4 इषु, 5 कृष्ण तिलेषु, 6 यव व्रीहिषु, 7 इक्षुतिलपाद्यकालावदाताः सुरायाम्, 8 गोमूत्र आच्छादने, 9 सुरा अहौ, 10 जीर्ण शालिषु, 11 पत्रमूले समस्तव्यस्ते, 12 कुमारीपुत्र, 13 कुमारीश्वशुर (कुमार, श्वशुर), 14 मणि ॥",

    "54005": "When the word सामि or any other word having this sense, is compounded with a participle in क्त, the affix कन् is not added to denote the sense of incompleteness. Thus सामिकृतम्, सामिभुक्तम् &c [[2.1.27]]. The word वचन shows that the synonyms of सामि are also to be taken. Thus अर्द्धकृतम्, नेमकृतम् &c.\n\nObjection:-- It is redundant to have prohibited कन् after a word preceded by 'half', because the word \"half\" itself shows that the action has not been completed.\n\nAnswer:-- The prohibition contained in this <i>sutra</i> does not refer to the कन् of the last <i>sutra</i>, where it has the sense of \"incompleteness\". It refers to that कन् which comes after a word, without changing the sense of that word (स्वार्थे कन्) ॥ Thus the words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम (the comparative and superlative degrees of भिन्न) show by the very fact of their comparison, that the action denoted by them is not complete. These words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम also take the affix कन् without change of sense. As भिन्नतरकः and भिम्मतमकः ॥ and बहुतरकं &c as used by <i>Patanjali</i> himself in the following sentences:-- एवं हि सूत्रमभिन्नतरकं भवति, एतैर्हि बहुतरकं व्याप्यते ॥ This कन् is also prohibited in the case of compounds with सामि ॥ In fact, this <i>sutra</i> teaches by implication <i>Jnapaka</i>) that कन् comes also in the sense of <i>svartha</i>.",
    "54006": "The word कन् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> and not its prohibition. The force of this कन् is nil, or it is an example of स्वार्थे कन् ॥ Thus बृहती + कन् = बृहतिका (प्रावारः) [[7.4.13]] (by which long vowel is shortened) \"an upper garment or mantle\".\n\nWhy do we say \"when it means dress\"? Observe बृहती छन्दः \"the metre called <i>Brihati</i>\".",
    "54007": "The force of ख is स्वार्थ i e. it does not change the sense of the word. The word अषडक्ष means \"that which has not six eyes\". षडक्ष is compounded from षट् + अक्ष्णि by adding षच् [[5.4.113]] \"having six eyes\". The affix ख is to be added to this word already ending in the affix <i>shach</i>. Thus अषडक्षीणे मन्त्रः \"a secret not having six eyes\". i. e. \"a secret known or determined by two persons only to the exclusion of a third\". Similarly आशितंगवीनं अरण्यम् = आशिता गावोऽस्मिन्नरण्ये = प्रभूतयवसं \"a forest where formerly cattle had grazed\". The augment मुम् is added to आशित by <i>nipata</i>, or irregularly. So also अलंकर्मीणः = अलं समर्थः कर्मणे पर्याप्तः = competent to do any act, clever. So अलं पुरुषीणः = अलं समर्थः पुरुषाय = प्रतिमल्लादिः = fit for a man.\n\nA word ending with अधि, will be a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound, by (II. I. 40), as the word अधि belongs to <i>Saundadi</i> class. As राजाधीनः ॥\n\nThe affix <i>kha</i> in the case of these words is invariable (<i>nitya</i>), because the word विभाषा occurs in the next <i>sutra</i>; and it is a maxim of interpretation that a rule occurring between two optional rules is <i>nitya</i>. The above words always occur with this affix and never without it. while in the case of other words taught hereafter this affix comes optionally.

The word इति in सस्थानेनेति is for the sake of distinctness. The word सस्थान as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound is the appropriate word to be taken here, and not when it is taken as a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound like समानं च तत् स्थानं च ॥ The word चेत् \"when\", is a conjunction : and joins the two meanings.\n\nThe rule [[5.3.9]] occurring between this rule and 8th rule, both of which are optional, must be taken to be a <i>nitya</i> rule, as explained above. द्वयोर्विभाषयोर्नित्या विधयः ॥",

Thus प्रतरम् नयामः ॥ or प्रतराम् वस्यः । प्रतर means प्रकृष्टतर ॥\n\nThe words ending in आम् and अम् are indeclinables as they are included in the class of <i>Svaradi</i> (1. 1.37).",

Thus गुडकल्पा द्राक्षा, तैलकल्पा प्रसन्ना (सुरा विशेषः) formed by adding the <i>swartha</i> affix कल्प [[5.3.67]] to गुड and तैल, the resultant words being in the feminine gender.

So also सप्तकृत्वः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"after a Numeral\"? Observe भूरीन् वारान् भुंक्ते \"he eats many times\".\n\nObjection:- Why do we say \"action\" when we know that an 'action' alone can be repeated, and not a substance or an attribute? Reply: The word क्रिया is employed in this <i>sutra</i> for the sake of the next <i>sutras</i>, into which its <i>anuvritti</i> flows. Thus in <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.19]], एकस्य सकृच्च when the affix does not apply to count repetition, because it is impossible for a unit to express repetition; but merely to count the \"action\" only.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"repetition\"? The affix will not apply when merely \"actions\" are counted. Thus पंचपाकाः \"five cookings\", दशपाकाः &c.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"counting\", when we know that a Numeral is nothing but counting ? Had the <i>sutra</i> been merely संख्यायाः क्रियाभ्यावृत्तौ कृत्वसुच्, there would arise this anomaly. The numerals upto ten denote only the thing numbered (संख्येय), but the numerals above those denote both the counting (संख्यान) and the thing counted (संख्येय) ॥ If गणन were not used, the affix would come only after the numeral denoting <i>sankhyeya</i> and not <i>sankhyana</i>. Thus it will apply to शतवारान् भुङ्क्ते = शतकृत्वः, but not here शतं वाराणां भुङ्क्ते; because here the word शत does not denote repetition, but merely a counting. By using the word गणन it applies to both.",

But not here in एकः पाकः as being against usage.",
    "54020": "This debars कृत्वसुच् which comes in the alternative. The word अविप्रकृष्ट \"not remote\", qualifies क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिः; i. e. when the recurring of the action takes place within a short time, it is अविप्रकृष्टकाल ॥ Thus बहुधा or बहुकृत्व दिवसस्य भुङ्क्ते \"he eats many times a day\".

According to <i>Kasika</i>: तत् signifies that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case, [[4.1.82]] the word प्रकृतम् means \"happening to be in abundance\". So that according to this interpretation the <i>sutra</i> should be translated, as done by Dr. Ballantyne, \"The affix <i>mayat</i> may be employed after a word denoting some substance, when we require an expression for it as abundant\". Thus अन्नं प्रकृतम् = अन्नमयम्  \"abundance of food\", अपूपमयम् \"abundance of cake\". According to others, that in which there is abundance of the thing signified by the word to which the affix मयट् is added, is denoted by the whole word. Thus अन्नं प्रकृतमस्मिन् = अन्नमयो यज्ञः \"a feast in which there is abundance of food\". अपूपमयं पर्व, वटकमयोयात्रा ॥ Both senses are possible, as the <i>sutra</i> is constructed.\n\n\"The word वचन in the <i>sutra</i> has two senses. It being made by the affix ल्युट् conveys the force both of the nature [[3.3.114]] and the site. In the former case, (taking, तत् प्रकृतवचन to mean \"the mention of that as abundant)\", we have अन्नमयम् \"abundance of grain\". But in the second case, (taking it to mean \"that in which something is spoken of as abundant)\" we have अन्नमयो यज्ञः \"sacrifice at which food is abundant\". (Dr. Ballantyne's <i>Laghukaumudi</i>).",
    "54022": "The च shows that मयट् also comes in the same sense. Thus मोदकाः प्रकृताः प्राचुर्येण प्रस्तुताः = मौदकिकम् [[4.2.47]] or मोदकमयम्; so also शाष्कुलिकम् or शष्कुलीमयम् ॥ In the second sense we have, मोदकाः प्रकृताः अस्मिन् यज्ञे = मौदकिको or मोदकमयो यज्ञः, शष्कुलिकः or शाष्कुलीमयः ॥",
    "54023": "Thus आनन्त्यम् = अनन्तः, आवसथ्यम् = आवसथः 'dwelling place, a sanctuary for sacred fire'. ऐतिह्यम् = इति ह 'traditional account', the affix here is added to a word which is not a <i>pratipadika</i>. The word इति ह means tradition, as इति ह स्मोपाध्यायाः कथयन्ति ॥ भैषज्यम् = भैषजम् ॥\n\nIt is optional to add this affix, owing to the general optional nature of all <i>taddhita</i> affixes. See [[4.1.82]].",
    "54024": "The word तादर्थ्यम् has the same meaning as तदर्थ \"for the sake of that\" [[2.1.37]]. Thus अग्निदेवतायै इदम् = अग्निदेवत्यम् \"offering &c, sacred to <i>Agni</i>\". So also पितृदेवत्यम्, वायुदेवत्यम् ॥",
    "54025": "The word तादर्थ्य is understood here also. Thus पादार्थमुदकं = पाद्यम् \"water, meant for washing the feet\". So also अर्घ्यम् ॥ The accent of these words is governed by [[6.1.213]], the <i>udatta</i> being on the first syllable.\n\nThe च in the <i>sutra</i> implies the inclusion of words other than पाद and अर्घ, not mentioned here. The affix यत् applies to other words also, as एष वै सप्तदशाक्षरश्छन्दस्यः प्रजापतिः । So also वसु, अयस्, ओक, कवि, क्षेम, उदक, वर्चस्, निष्केवल, उक्थ, जन, पूर्व, नव, सूर, मर्त, यविष्ठ ॥ These words take यत् in the Vedas. Thus वसव्यः, अयस्यः, ओक्यः, कव्यः, क्षेम्यः, उदक्यः, वर्चस्यः, निष्केवल्यम्, उक्थ्यः, जन्यः, पूर्व्यः, नव्यः, सूर्यः, मर्त्यः and यविष्ठ्यः in अग्निरीशेवसव्यस्य । अयस्यो वसानाः (द्वितीयाबहुवचनस्यालुक् । अपो वसाना इत्यर्थः) स्वओक्ये । कव्योरी । क्षेम्यस्य वस्यति । वायुर्वर्चस्यः ॥ निष्केवल्यं शंसति । उक्थ्यं शंसति । जन्यंताभिः । पूर्व्या दिशः । स्तोमैर्जनयामि नव्यम् । सूर्यः । मर्त्यः । यविष्ठ्यः ॥ So also the words आमुष्यायण् and आमुष्यपुत्रिका ॥\n\nVart:- The affix आवतु comes after the word सम; as समावत् वसति, समावद् गृह्णाति ॥\n\nVart:- नू is the substitute of नव, and the affixes त्नप्, तनप् and ख are added to it; as, नूत्नम्, नूतनम्, नवीनम् ॥\n\nVart:- To the word प्र meaning 'old', the affix म is added as well as the affixes त्म, तम and ख e.g. प्रणम्, and प्रत्नम्, प्रतनम् and प्रीणम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix धेय is added to the words भाग, रूप and नाम, e.g. भागधेयम्, रूपधेयम्, नामधेयम् ॥ This affix comes after मित्र in the Vedas, as, मित्रधेयं यतस्व ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अञ् comes after आग्नीध्र and साधारण, as, आग्नीध्रम्, साधारणम् ॥ The feminine is formed by ङीप् as आग्नीध्रा, साधारणी ॥ All these are illustrations of the option allowed by [[4.1.82]], so that sometimes these affixes do not apply, as अग्नीध्रा शाला, साधारणा भूः ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, अञ् comes after अयवस and मरुत्, आयवसं and मारुतं in आयवसे रमन्ते, मारुतं शर्द्धः ॥",
    "54026": "The word तादर्थ्य is understood here also. Thus अतिथये इदम् = आतिथ्यम् ॥",
    "54027": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of तादर्थ्य does not apply here and ceases. Thus देवता = देवः ॥ This word is always in the feminine, another example of the rule that a word derived by a <i>svarthika</i> affix does not always follow the gender of its primitive.",

    "54038": "Thus प्राज्ञः = प्रज्ञः \"a wise person\", feminine प्राज्ञी; while प्राज्ञः \"a man possessed of wisdom\" with feminine प्राज्ञा comes from प्रज्ञा \"wisdom\" by the affix ण having the sense of मतुप् (\"being possessed of\"), taught in [[5.2.101]]. The प्रज्ञ of this <i>sutra</i> comes from the root प्रजानाति = प्रज्ञः \"he who knows fully\".\n\nThe word विदन् occurs in the list of प्रज्ञादि words. It is formed by the addition of the affix शतृ [[3.2.124]] to the root, as, विद् + शतृ = विदत् nom. s. विदन् ॥ The very fact that we have such a from विदन् shows that the substitution of वसु for शतृ after the word विद् taught in [[7.1.36]] (by which we get विद्वान्) is an optional substitution, the word \"optionally\" being drawn in from <i>Sutra</i> [[7.1.35]]. The word श्रोत्र takes अण् when meaning 'body', as श्रौत्रम्; otherwise श्रोत्रम् 'the sense of hearing', जुह्वत् takes अण् when meaning 'a black antelope', as जौह्वतः ॥ The word कृष्ण takes अण् when meaning 'a black antelope', as, कार्ष्णः ॥\n\n1 प्रज्ञ, 2 वणिज्, 3 उशिज्, 4 उष्णिज् (उष्णिक्, उष्णिह्), 5 प्रत्यक्ष, 6 विद्वस्, 7 विदन्, 8 षोडन्, 9 विद्या, 10 मनस्, 11 श्रोत्र शरीरे, 12 जुह्वत्, 13 कृष्ण मृगे, 14 चिकीर्षत्, 15 चोर, 16 शत्रु (शक), 17 योध, 18 चक्षुस् (वक्षस्), 19 वसु (वस्!), 20 एनस् (एत्!) 21 मरुत्, 22 कुञ्च (कुङ्) 23 सत्वन्तु (सत्वन्, सत्वन्त), 24 दशार्ह, 25 वयस्, 26 व्याकृत, 27 असुर (आतुर!) 28 रक्षस्, 29 पिशाच, 30 अशनि, 31 कर्षापण (का!), 32 देवता, 33 बन्धु, 34 षोडश, 35 धूर्त, 36 राजा ॥",
    "54039": "Thus मृत्तिका = मृद् 'mud'. Of course this is also an optional affix not a <i>nitya</i> affix like many of the <i>svarthika</i> affixes enumerated in [[5.4.7]].",
    "54040": "This debars the affix रूपप् [[5.3.66]]. Thus प्रशस्ता मृद् = मृत्सा or मृत्स्ना ॥ These two affixes are <i>nitya</i> or invariable, i. e. whenever superiority is to be expressed we must add these affixes. The reason for our calling it <i>nitya</i> is that the word अन्यतरस्याम् 'optionally' follows it in [[5.4.42]], so that this affix is not optional c. [[5.4.7]], [[5.4.10]], &c.",
    "54041": "The word प्रशंसायाम् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. This also debars रूपप् [[5.3.66]]. Thus वृकतिः or वृकतातिः, as, योनो मरुतो वृकतातिमर्त्यः (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Veda</i> 11. 34. 9). Similarly ज्येष्ठतातिः ॥",
    "54042": "No especial कारक being mentioned, all cases such as accusative &c are to be taken. Thus बहूनि ददाति = बहुशो ददाति, बहुभिर्ददाति = बहुशो ददाति ॥  So also बहुभ्यः आगच्छति or बहुश आगच्छति &c. Similarly अल्पशो ददाति = अल्पं or अल्पेन &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"signifying much or little\"? Observe गां ददाति, अश्वं ददाति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is a karaka\"? Observe बहूनां स्वामी \"lord of many\". Here the words are in genitive case and a genitive or 6th case is not a कारक or a case, dependent or related to a verb: and so the affx is not applied here.\n\nBy the word 'signifying', the synonyms of बहु and अल्प are also included. Thus भूरिशो ददाति, स्तोकशो ददाति ॥\n\nThis affix is to be applied only when the action refers to an auspicious act. Thus बहुशो ददाति = अभ्युदयिकेषु कर्मसु; अल्पशो ददाति = अनिष्टेषु कर्मसु ॥ Thus बहुशो देहि \"Give much on auspicious occasions as sacrifices &c\". अल्पशो देहि \"give a little on unauspicious, occasions as funeral feasts &c\".",
    "54043": "Thus द्वौ द्वौ मोदकौ ददाति = द्विशो मोदकौ ददाति \"He gives two sweet-meats to each\". So also त्रिशः ॥ Similarly after words in the singular number as, कार्षापणशो ददाति \"he gives a <i>Karshapana</i> coin to each\". So also माषशः, पादशः ॥ That by which the sense of unit is expressed is called <i>eka</i>-<i>vachana</i>. The words <i>karshapana</i> &c denote quantity, but their function in the sentence is to denote one-ness i. e. one to each, though in fact many are given.\n\nWhy de we say \"after Numerals and units of coin\"? Observe घटं घटं ददाति \"he gives a pot to each\". Why do we say \"when a distributive sense is meant\"? Observe द्वौ ददाति \"He gives two\". कार्षापणम् ददाति \"he gives a <i>karshapana</i>\".\n\nThis rule of course applies when the word is in relation with a verb viz. when it is a <i>karaka</i>, and not when it is in the genitive case governing another noun. As द्वयोर्द्वयोः स्वामी \"Lord of two each\". कार्षापणस्य कार्षापाणस्य स्वामी \"Possessor of a <i>karshapanas</i> each\". In fact the work \"<i>karakat</i>\" of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. This <i>sutra</i> is exception to [[8.1.4]].",
    "54044": "This Ablative case is ordained by <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.11]]. Thus प्रद्युम्नः वासुदेवतः प्रति, अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of वा \"optionally\" runs here also: thus it is an optional rule; we have the regular forms वासुदेवात् &c, also.\n\nVart:- The affix तसि comes after the words आदि &c: as, आदितः, मध्यतः, पार्श्वतः, पृष्ठतः &c. This is an <i>akritigana</i>, no complete list being given.",
    "54045": "Thus ग्रामतः आगच्छति or ग्रामात्, so also चोरतः or चोरतो बिभेति, अध्ययनतः or अध्ययनात् पराजयते ॥ See <i>Sutras</i> (l. 4. 24), [[1.4.25]], and [[1.4.26]] &c. Not so when the verbs हीय and रुह govern the ablative : as, सार्थात् हीयते, पर्वताद् अवरोहति ॥ The form हीय is given in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that the verb हा  whose present tense is जहाति is to be taken, and not जिहीति ॥ Thus we have भूमितः उज्जिहीते or भूमेरुज्जिहीते ॥ How do you explain the use of \"<i>tasi</i>\" in the following well-known verse: \"मन्त्रो हीनः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा\"? The words here are not in the ablative, but in the Instrumental case i. e. स्वरेण वर्णेन वा हीनः ॥",
    "54046": "Thus वृत्तेनातिगृह्यते or वृत्ततोऽतिगृह्यते, चारित्रेण or चारित्रतोऽतिगृह्यते ॥ This means when a person of good conduct surpasses others through his conduct, he is said \"to have excelled through his conduct and character\". So also वृत्तेन or वृत्ततो न व्यथते; similarly चरित्रेन or चरित्रतो &c, the sense being he does not succumb or is not moved owing to his strength of conduct or character. Similarly वृत्तेन or वृत्ततः क्षिप्तः, चरित्रेण or चरित्रतः क्षिप्तः \"blamed owing to his bad conduct\".\n\nWhy do we say \"when not denoting an agent\"? Observe देवदत्तेन क्षिप्तः \"blamed by <i>Devadatta</i>\".",
    "54047": "The words अकर्त्तरि and तृतीयायाः are understood in this aphorism. Thus वृत्तेन हीयते or वृत्ततो हीयते ॥ चारित्रेण हीयते or चारित्रतो हीयते ॥ So also in construction with the word पाप, as, वृत्तेन पापः or वृत्ततः पापः ॥ चारित्रेण पापः or चारित्रतः पापः ॥ This use of the affix is in places other than those where censure is meant: in other words, it comes where no censure is implied but a simple fact is mentioned. Where censure is implied, the affix <i>tasi</i> would come by force of the preceding aphorism [[5.4.46]].\n\nThe word अकर्तरि being understood here also, the affix does not come when the 3rd case-affix has the force of an agent: as देवदत्तेन हीयते ॥",
    "54048": "Taking sides with one faction or another is called व्याश्रयः ॥ Thus देवा अर्जुनस्य पक्षेऽभवन् = देवा अर्जुनतोऽभवन् ॥ 'The <i>Devas</i> became <i>Arjunites</i>'. So also आदित्याः कर्णतोऽभवन्. \"The <i>Adityas</i> became <i>Karnaites</i>\".\n\nWhy do we say \"when it denotes a Party-name\"? Observe, वृक्षस्य शाखा \"the branch of the tree\".",
    "54049": "The word रोग means 'disease', and अपनयन means 'healing', 'curing'. Thus प्रवाहिकायाः प्रतीकारं कुरु = प्रवाहिकातः कुरु; so also छर्दिकातः कुरु ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when healing is meant'? Observe प्रवाहिकायाः प्रकोपनं कुरु ॥",
    "54050": "The words अभुततद्भावे are not words of <i>Panini</i>, but of the <i>Vartika</i>-<i>Kara</i>, and read into the <i>sutra</i> by the author of <i>Kasika</i>. When something or somebody has become that which is expressed by the stem, then this affix च्वि is added. When the cause of a thing arrives at the state of being that very thing so produced, it is said to be <i>abhutatadbhava</i> 'the state of that what it was not'. The agent of the action of attaining is called <i>sampadya</i> <i>karta</i>. Thus अशुक्लः शुक्लः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = शुक्लो करोति \"he whitens\" -- when some one who is not white becomes white i. e. some one makes him so, then we say शुक्ली करोति ॥ So also शुक्ला भवति, शुक्ली स्यात् = मलिनं शुक्ली भवति ॥ The word शुक्ली is thus formed:- शुक्ल + च्वि = शुक्ल् + ई + (the अ of <i>sukla</i> is changed into ई by [[7.4.32]], and the whole affix is elided by [[6.1.67]]) = शुक्ली ॥ Similarly घटी करोति मृदम् 'he makes a jar of the clay': घटी भवति, घटी स्यात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'becoming that what it was not'? Observe शुक्लं करोति 'he makes white'. Here the thing that has been made white is not expressed, and hence no affixing takes place.\n\nWhy do we say \"when conjoined with the verbs कृ, भू and अस्?\" Observe अशुक्लः शुक्लो जायते. The verb here is जन् 'to produce', and hence no affixing. Why have we used the words <i>sampadya</i> <i>kartari</i> 'the agent that has attained', for even without their use, the words <i>abhuta</i>-<i>tadbhava</i> 'becoming what the thing previously was not', would imply that the attainment was of the agent? The use of <i>sampadya</i>-<i>kartari</i> shows that the attainment spoken of here should be of the 'agent', and not of any other <i>karaka</i>, as, अदेवगृहे देवगृहे भवति 'becoming in the temple what was not before in the temple; such as a tree &c'. Here the <i>karaka</i> is locative and not agent, and the becoming of what the thing previously was not refers to location and not to agency. Hence no affix is added here.",
    "54051": "The affix च्वि would have come after these words by force of the last <i>sutra</i> which is of universal application : the present <i>sutra</i> is made in order to teach the elision of the consonant. Thus अनरुररुः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = अरू करोति, अरू भवति, अरू स्यात् ॥ So also उन्मनी करोति, भवति or स्यात्, so also उच्चक्षू, विचेती, विरही, and विरजी करोति or भवति or स्यात् ॥ The short उ of अरु and चक्षु is lengthened by [[7.4.26]], and the अ of the other words is changed into ई by [[7.4.32]].",
    "54052": "The whole phrase \"when the agent has attained to a state it previously had not and the verbs <i>kri</i>, <i>bhu</i> and <i>asti</i> are in conjunction\", is understood here. The affix साति is employed when the original is changed in its totality (कृत्स्न). Thus अग्निसाद् भवति शस्त्रम् \"the whole weapon is in a blaze-- has become fire\". We may also say अग्नी भवति शस्त्रम् ॥ So also उदकसाद् भवति लवणम् or उदकी भवति लवणम् \"The salt becomes all water\".\n\nWhy do we say \"in its totality\"? Observe एकदेशेन पटः शुक्ली भवति \"the cloth whitens in part\".\n\nThe word \"optionally\" shows that the affix <i>chvi</i> also comes in the same sense. While the optional affixing of these terminations <i>chvi</i>, <i>sati</i> &c is governed by the <i>Maha</i>-<i>vibhasha</i> of <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.82]] (see [[5.3.1]].",
    "54053": "The word अभिविधि means 'pervasion'. The force of the word च in the <i>sutra</i> is that the same sense is expressed when the verbs कृ, भू and अस् are in construction as well. By drawing the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>vibhasha</i> into this <i>sutra</i>, we may, in the alternative, employ the affix च्वि in the same sense of <i>abhividhi</i>: but then it must be followed by the verbs कृ, भू and अस् only and not by the verb संपद ॥\n\nThus अग्निसात् संपद्यते or अग्निसात् भवति; उदकसात् संपद्यते or भवति &c. Or उदकी भवति or अग्नी भवति ॥\n\nWhat is the difference between the words <i>abhividhi</i> and <i>kartsnya</i> of these two <i>sutras</i>? Where all things of similar origin get changed, though it be partially only, it is called <i>abhividhivikara</i> As, अस्यां सेनायाम् उत्पातेन सर्वम् शस्त्रम् अग्निसात् सम्पद्यते; or वर्षासु सर्वम् लवनम् उदकसात् सम्पद्यते ॥ Here सर्व has the force of प्रकार कार्त्स्न्य, namely, all things belonging to the kind of weapons such as swords, lances and all things of the nature of salt, but not these things individually in its totality. While the word <i>kartsnya</i> means that one thing in all its parts assumes the form of another thing. In short, the difference between these two words is this: when one object is changed in all its parts, it is <i>kartsnya</i> change, when many objects are changed in some of their parts, it is <i>abhividhi</i> change.",
    "54054": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of अभूततद्भावे ceases here, as a different sense altogether is assigned to the affix. The <i>anuvritti</i> of the four verbs <i>Kri</i> &c, however, runs into the <i>sutra</i>. The word तदधीन means 'under the supremacy or control of that', 'under the proprietorship of that'. Proprietor in general and the object of rulership in general are indicated by the word <i>tadadhina</i>. Thus राजाधीनं करोति = राजसात् करोति \"he (a king) brings it (a kingdom) under his dominion\". Similarly राजसात् स्यात् or भवति or संपद्यते ॥ So also ब्राह्मणसाद् भवति, करोति, स्यात् or संपद्यते ॥",
    "54055": "The phrase \"dependent upon that\" is understood here also. The word देय qualifies the above phrase. When a thing which is known as a proper gift for the <i>Brahmanas</i>, is put under their control by offering it to them, then the affix <i>tra</i> is employed. Thus ब्राह्मणाधीनं देयं करोति = ब्राह्मणत्रा or ब्राह्मणसात् करोति \"He gives it to the <i>Brahmanas</i>, as it is an object which ought to be given to them\". ब्राह्मणत्रा भवति \"it becomes given to the <i>Brahmans</i>\". So also with यात् and संपद्यते ॥ Why do we say \"when the sense is that of to be given\"? Observe राजसाद् भवति राष्ट्रम् ॥",
    "54056": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sati</i> ceases, that of <i>tra</i> continues. The verbs <i>kri</i>, <i>bhu</i> and <i>asti</i> also have no scope here. This is a general <i>sutra</i>. Thus देवात् गच्छति = देवत्रा गच्छति, देवेषु वसति = देवत्रा वसति ॥ So also मनुष्यत्रा, पुरुषत्रा, पुरुत्रा, and मर्त्यत्रा ॥\n\nBy using the word 'diversely' in the aphorism it is intended that the affix comes in this sense after other words also; as बहुत्रा जीवतो मनः ॥",
    "54057": "The sound in which the letters अ आ &c are not distinctly expressed is called <i>avyakta</i> 'unmanifest' or 'inarticulate'. The imitation of such a sound is called <i>avyakta</i>-<i>anukarana</i>. That whose half consists of at least two syllables is called <i>dvyajavarardha</i>, that is a polysyllabic word of four syllables or more when doubled, the smallest number of whose vowels are two, not less, when halved. The phrase \"when joined with <i>kri</i>, <i>bhu</i> and <i>asti</i>\" is understood here. The affix comes after that word which when reduplicated is such that its half (<i>ardha</i>) is at least (<i>avara</i>) of two syllables (<i>dvyach</i>). When the affix डाच् is added there is reduplication of the word. That is first the word is reduplicated and then the affix is added. Thus पटत् is a sound imitation word. By reduplication it becomes पटपटत् (eg. पटत् + पटत् = पटप् पटत् the final त् of the first word is changed in to the form of the next letter प्, and then for two प one is substituted by [[6.1.100]]). Thus पटपटत् करोति = पटपटा करोति \"he makes a sound like <i>patat</i> <i>patat</i>\". So also with भवति and स्यात् ॥ So also दमदमा करोति, भवति or स्यात् ॥ The final अत् of पटपटत् is elided by [[6.4.143]] before the affix डाच् having an indicatory ड्, the real affix being आ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is name of an imitative sound?\" Observe दृषत् करोति \"it makes or turns to stone\". Why do we say \"after that half which consists of at least two vowels\"? Observe श्रत् करोति 'he utters the exclamation <i>srat</i>'. Why do we say \"at least\"? Observe खरटखरटा करोति where the half consists of more than two syllables and the rule still applies. So also त्रपटत्रपटा करोति ॥ Why do we say \"when इति does not follow\"? Observe पटिति करोति [[6.1.98]]. The च् of डाच् is for the sake of accent, it prevents the circumflex (<i>swarita</i>) accent. Thus, पटपटा꣡ + अ꣡सि ॥ Here first the अ of असि which was <i>udatta</i>, becomes <i>anudatta</i> by (VIII. I. 28). Then by [[8.2.5]], आ꣡ of टा and अ of असि coalesce into an <i>udatta</i> आ꣡, as पटपटासि ॥ But then comes in rule [[8.2.6]] which would make this आ optionally <i>svarita</i>, the indicatory च् prevents it. Some read द्व्यजवरार्ध्यात्, the य however does not change the sense.",
    "54058": "The repetition of the word कृ in this <i>sutra</i> indicates that the भू and अस्ति are not to be taken. Thus द्वितीया करोति = द्वितीयं कर्षे (= विलेखनं) करोति 'he makes the second ploughing of the field'. So also तृतीया करोति, शम्बा करोति 'he makes the field ploughed contrariwise to what it was ploughed before = अनुलोम कृषं क्षेत्रं पुनः प्रतिलोमं कृषति ॥ So also बाजी करोति = सहबीजेन विलेखनं करोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say when meaning \"to plough\" ?

    "54059": "The word कृ is understood here. Thus द्विगुणा or त्रिगुणा करोति क्षेत्रम् \"he ploughs the field twice or thrice\" = द्विगुणं विलेखनं करोति क्षेत्रस्य ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning to plough\"? Observe द्विगुणां करोति रज्जुम् \"he doubles the rope\".",
    "54060": "The word कृ is understood here also. The <i>anuvritti</i> of कृष ceases. The getting of leisure from the duties is called समय or 'time; the neglect or loss of such time is meant by the word यापना ॥ Thus समया करोति = कालक्षेपं करोति (अद्य मे पारवश्यं, श्वः परश्वो वास्य समय इत्येवं यो बहुषु दिवसेषु अतिवर्त्तते, स एवमुच्यते) 'who procrastinates'. Why do we say when the sense is that \"neglecting\"? Observe समयं करोति \"he makes time\".",
    "54061": "The word कृ is understood here also. The word <i>ati</i>-<i>vyathana</i> means violent pain. Thus सपत्रा करोति मृगं व्याधः = सपत्रं शरमस्य शरीरे प्रवेशयति  \"the hunter pierces the stag with the arrow so violently that the feathered part of the arrow also enters the body\". So also निष्पत्रा करोति = शरीराच् छरमपरपार्श्वे निष्क्रामयति \"he pierces so voilently that the arrow entering one side comes out of the other with its feathers\". Why do we say when meaning \"to cause violent pain\"? Observe सपत्रं वृक्षं करोति जलसेचकः, निष्पत्रं वृक्षतलं करोति भूमिशोधकः ॥",
    "54062": "The verb कृ should be read into the <i>sutra</i>. The word निष्कोषण means to bring the inner organs out, or to eviscerate. Thus निष्कुल करोति पशून् \"he disembowels or guts the animals\". निष्कुला करोति दाडिमम् \"he takes out the kernel or seeds of the pomegranite\". Why do we say \"when meaning to disembowel or take out the kernel\"? Observe निष्कुलान् करोति शत्रून् \"he makes the enemies family-less\".",
    "54063": "The word आनुलोम्य means 'agreeability', 'to conform to the wishes of the object of adoration'. Thus सुखा करोति, प्रिया करोति स्वामिन् = स्वाम्यादेर्श्चित्तमाराधयति \"tries to please the heart of the master &c\". This affix comes when, while doing a pleasant or agreeable thing, the idea is to please another by such an act. Otherwise observe: सुखं करोति or प्रियं करोति औषधपानम् \"the drinking of medicines gives pleasure &c\".",
    "54064": "The verb कृ is understood and <i>pratilomya</i> means 'to oppose' or \"to act against another's wishes\", \"to pain the heart of one's master &c\".

    "54065": "Thus शूले पचति = शूला करोति मांसम् \"he roasts the meat on a spit\". Why do we say \"when meaning to roast\" ? Observe शूलं करोति कदन्नम् \"the bad food causes colic\".",
    "54066": "The word सत्य means 'truth' as opposed to 'falsehood'. Sometimes it means to swear, as in the sentence \"सत्येन शापयेद् विप्रम्\" ॥ This latter sense is prohibited. Thus सत्या करोति वनिक् भाण्डम् \"the merchant concludes the bargain of the goods i. e. he settles that he will purchase these wares\". Why do we say 'when not meaning to swear'? Observe सत्यं करोति ब्राह्मणः \"the <i>Brahmana</i> swears\".",
    "54067": "The word परिवापण means 'to shave' 'to raze'. The word मद्र means 'auspicious'. Thus मङ्गलं मुण्डनं करोति = मद्रा करोति ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word भद्रा; as भद्रा करोति नापितं कुमारं  \"the barber shaves the hair of the boy on the auspicious occasion\".\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'to shave'. Observe मद्रं or भद्रं करोति ॥",
    "54068": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> or regulating <i>sutra</i>: and governs all <i>sutras</i> upto the end of this chapter. All the affixes to be ordained here after become the final part and integral portion of a compound, so that whenever a compound is formed, these affixes must be added to complete the compound. These affixes are useful in forming the <i>Avyayibhava</i>, the <i>Dvigu</i>, the <i>Dvandva</i>, the <i>Tatpurusha</i> and the <i>Bahu</i>-<i>vrihi</i> compounds: in fact so long as these affixes are not added, the compounds do not get the designation of <i>Avyayibhava</i> &c. Thus उप + राजन् = उपराजन् : now before this word can be properly called an <i>Avyayibhava</i>, we must elide the final अन् by adding the <i>samasanta</i> affix डच् [[5.4.108]], and we get the form उपराज, to which अम् is added by [[2.4.83]] and we have उपराजम्, so also अधिराजं ॥ So also द्विपुरी, त्रिपुरी the <i>samasanta</i> अ being added to पुर् by [[5.4.74]], then the feminine affix ङीप् by [[4.1.21]], the whole word द्विपुर being called <i>Dvigu</i>. So also, कटकवलयिनी and शङ्खनूपुरिणी ॥ Here the affix इनि [[5.2.128]] is added to the whole, <i>samasanta</i> word कटकवलय &c which gets the name of <i>Dvandva</i>. Similarly विधु꣡रः (विगतोधुरः), प्र꣡धुरः (प्रगतोधुरः). Here the whole <i>samasanta</i> [[5.4.74]] word gets the name of <i>Tatpurusha</i>, and hence the first member retains its accent by [[6.2.2]], namely <i>udatta</i>. (<i>phit</i> IV. 12 and 13) उचैर्धुरः, नीच꣡र्धुरः being <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the final, as उचैः, नीचैः have been taught as <i>antodatta</i> in the very list of <i>Svaradi</i> (l. 1. 37).\n\nAs a general rule all affixes come at the end of a word [[2.1.2]], what is the use of employing the word \"<i>anta</i>\" in this <i>sutra</i>? It means that when words like <i>avyayibhava</i> &c are employed, they mean words having those affixes already at their end. Thus the <i>Dvigu</i> compound of द्वि॑ + धुर = द्विधुर् + अ [[5.4.74]] = द्विधुरः so that when rule [[4.1.21]] says that the feminine of <i>Dvigu</i> compounds ending in अ take ई, it refers to <i>Dvigu</i> compounds which have already taken the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ, otherwise the rule [[4.1.21]] would not have applied, for strictly speaking द्विधुर् ends in र् <i>r</i> and not in  अ ॥ Similarly rule [[5.2.128]] ordaining इनि after <i>Dvandva</i> compounds, means that the affix comes after a <i>Dvandva</i> compound that has already taken the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् [[5.4.106]], as कोश + निषत् = कोश + निषद् + टच् [[5.4.106]] कोशनिषदं, कोशनिषदिनी ॥",
    "54069": "Later on will be mentioned certain words which when standing as member in a compound take these <i>samasanta</i> affixes. The present rule prohibits the application of those affixes when such words are preceded by a word expressing praise. Thus [[5.4.91]] ordains the affix टच् when the words राजन् enters a compound, as, महा + राजन् = महा + राजन् + टच् = महाराजः, and not महाराजा ॥ But सुराजा, अतिराजा, so also सुगौः, अतिगौः [[5.4.92]] prohibited)).\n\nVart:- The word expressing praise must be सु or अति and not any word expressing praise in general. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply in परमराजः and परमगवः ॥\n\nVart:- This prohibition applies up to <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.113]] exclusive. Thus सुसक्थः, अतिसक्थः, स्वक्षः, अत्यक्षः, here the affix पच् [[5.4.113]] is not prohibited.",
    "54070": "Thus किं + राजन् = किंराजन् as किंराजा यो न रक्षति \"He is no-king who does not protect\". किंसखा योऽभिद्रुह्यति, किंगौर्यो न वहति ॥ [[5.4.91]], [[5.4.92]], (II. I. 64). The compounding here takes place by Rule (II. I. 64).\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning reproach\"? Observe कस्य राजा = किंराज, किंसखः, किंगवः ॥",
    "54071": "Thus अराजा, असखा, अगौः [[5.4.91]] and [[5.4.92]] prohibited). Why do we say \"after a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound?\" The same words preceded by the negative particle will take the <i>samasanta</i> affix when forming compounds other than <i>Tatpurusha</i>, as अणृचो मानवकः, अधुरं शकटम् ॥ [[5.4.74]] applied)).",
    "54072": "This declares an option, where under the last <i>sutra</i> the omission would have been necessary. Thus अपथम् or अपन्थाः ॥ (See [[5.4.74]] and [[2.4.30]]).",
    "54073": "This <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is formed by rule [[2.2.25]]. Thus उपदशाः, उपविंशाः, उपत्रिंशाः, आसप्तदशाः, अदूरदशाः, अधिकदशाः, द्वित्राः, पंचधाः, पंचदशाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a numeral'? Observe चित्रगुः, शबलगुः ॥ Why do we say 'not after <i>bahu</i> and <i>gana</i>'? Observe, उपबहवः, उपगणाः ॥ The difference here is in the accent for had डच् been added, it would have made the final of उपगण acute, but it not being so, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the first.\n\nVart:- The <i>Tatpurusha</i> compouds of numerals like निस्त्रिंश &c, take also the affix डच् ॥ Thus निर्गतानि त्रिंशतः = निस्त्रिंशानि वर्षाणि देवदत्तस्य '<i>Devadatta</i> is more than thirty years old' ॥ निर्गतस्त्रिंशतांगुलिभ्य = निस्त्रिंशः खड्गः 'the sword is more than thirty fingers long'.",
    "54074": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>Bahuvrihi</i> does not enter here. It applies to all compounds in general. The word अनक्षे qualifies धुर्, as it cannot qualify the words ऋक् &c.\n\nThus अनृचः बह्वृचः,अर्द्धर्चः, <i>pur</i>: as, ललाटपुरम्, नान्दीपुरम् ॥ <i>ap</i> as, द्वीपम् = (द्विर्गता आपो यस्मिन्) = द्वि + अप् = द्वि + ईप् [[6.3.97]] = द्वीपं, अन्तरीपम्, समीपम्  ॥ <i>dhur</i> as, राजधुरा, महाधुरा ॥ <i>pathin</i>, as, जलपथः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not in conjunction with अक्ष?\" Observe, अक्षस्य धूः = अक्षधूः, दृढधूरक्षः ॥\n\nThe words अनृचः and बह्वृचः apply to students of <i>Rik</i>: thus अनृचः means \"a boy who has not read the <i>Rik</i>\". बह्वृचः \"a <i>Brahmana</i> who has read many <i>Rig</i> verses\". The affix अ is not applied when it refers to the Vedas, as अनृक साम, बह्वृक् सूक्तम् ॥",
    "54075": "As प्रतिसामम्, अनुसामम्, अवसामम् ॥ प्रतिलोमम्, अनुलोमम्, अवलोमम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after the word भूमि preceded by the words कृष्ण, उदक्, पाण्डु, and also after the words गोदावरी and नदी when preceded by a numeral. As, कृष्णभूमः पाण्डुभूमः, उदग्भूमः ॥ पञ्चनदम्, सप्तगोदावरम् (see (II. I. 20)).\n\nVart:- The affix अच् is added to भूमि when preceded by a numeral. As, द्विभूमः प्रासादः, त्रिभूमः &c, दशभूमकं सूत्रं ॥ This affix is added to words other than those mentioned above: as पद्मनाभः, ऊर्णनाभः, समरात्रः, दीर्घरात्रः, अरात्रः ॥ Here the affix अच् is added to नाभि and रात्रि ॥ All this can be done by dividing the above <i>sutra</i> into two parts viz. (1) अच् (2) प्रत्यन्व &c. That is अच् comes after all compounds and (2) after सामन् and लोमन् preceded by प्रति &c.",
    "54076": "The word अच् is understood here. Thus लवणाक्षम्, पुष्कराक्षम् ॥ These are <i>Tatpurusha</i> metaphors formed by (II. I. 56).\n\nWhy do we say \"when not meaning the eye\"? Observe ब्राह्मणाक्षि ॥ How do you explain the forms कबराक्षः, गवाक्षः, which apparently contradict this rule, because कबराक्ष is a many-holed leather horse-veil through which the horses can see, and so also गवाक्ष is a window through which men see? This is no fault. The word दर्शन in the <i>sutra</i> does not mean 'to see', here, but is a synonym of 'eye'.",
    "54077": "The first three of these words are <i>Bahuvrihi</i>: अचतुरः = अदृश्यान्यविद्यमानानि वा चत्वारि यस्य 'that whose four are absent or non-existent'. विचतुरः = विगतानि चत्वारि यस्य \"whose four are gone\". सुचतुरः = शोभनानि चत्वारि यस्य \"whose four are good\".\n\nThe next eleven words are <i>Dvandva</i> compounds. They are clear. Thus स्त्री च पुमांश्च = स्त्रीपुंसौ 'the man and woman' but not here स्त्रियाः पुमान् (स्त्रियं प्रति पुमान् शूरः) = स्त्रीपुमान् \"a brave towards women only\". धेनुश्च अनड्वांश्च = धेन्वनडुहौ \"cow and bull\". ऋक् च साम च = ऋक्सामे \"the <i>Rik</i> and the <i>Saman</i>\". वाक् च मनश्च = वाङ्मनसे \"the speech and mind\". अक्षि च भ्रुवौ च = अक्षिभ्रुवम् \"the eye the brow\". The compound is singular as being parts of members of human body, [[2.4.2]]. दाराश्च गावश्च = दारगवम् \"the wives and cows\". रात्रि च दिवा च = रात्रिंदिवम् ॥ ऊरू + अष्ठीवन्तौ + अच् = ऊर्वष्ठीवम् ॥ Here the final syllable (called टि) is elided : so also पादौ + अष्टीवन्तौ = पद् + अष्टीव् + अच् = पदष्ठीवम् ॥ नक्तं च दिवा च = नक्तंदिवं 'by night and day'. These are two indeclinables having the force of locative, and this compoundirg is also irregular. The words अहर् and दिवा both mean 'day': the compound अहर्दिवम् is not, however, a superfluous compound of two synonyms. It is used here in a distributive sense = अहन्यहनि \"day by day\". The word सरजसम् is an <i>Avyayibhava</i>, meaning 'all', as सरजसमभ्यवहरति ॥ The affix does not come when it is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>: as सह + रजसा = सरजः पङ्कजम् ॥ The word निःश्रेयसं = निश्चितं श्रेयः and is a <i>Tatpurusha</i>: but not so in निश्रेयस्कः पुरुषः ॥ Then is the word पुरुषायुषम् a Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> = पुरुषस्यायुः ॥ Not so when it is a <i>Dvandva</i>, as पुरुषश्च आयुश्च = पुरुषायुषी ॥ The words द्व्यायुषम् and त्र्यायुषम् are <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i> compounds. Therefore not here, द्वयोरायुः = द्व्यायुः, त्र्यायुः ॥ The word ऋग्यजुषम् is a <i>Dvandva</i>. Therefore not here ऋग्यजुस्योन्मुग्धस्य = ऋग्यजुरुन्मुग्धः (य ऋचोयजूंषि मन्यते) ॥ The three words ending in उक्ष are <i>Karmadharaya</i>. Not so when these are <i>Bahuvrihi</i>: as जातोक्षा ब्राह्मणाः &c. The word उपशुनम् is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> = शुनः समीपम् ॥ Here the non-elision of the final syllable, and the change of व of श्वन् into उ (<i>samprasarana</i>) are irregular. The word गोष्ठश्वः is a Locative <i>Tatpurusha</i>, as गोष्ठेऽश्वाः = गोष्ठश्वः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after चतुर् when preceded by त्रि and उप, as त्रिचतुराः, उपचतुराः ॥",
    "54078": "Thus ब्रह्मवर्च्चसम्, हस्तिवर्च्चसम् ॥ <i>Varchas</i> means 'light', 'strength'.\n\nVart:- So also when <i>Varchas</i> is preceded by the words <i>pallya</i> and <i>rajan</i> : as, पल्ल्यवर्च्चसम्, राजवर्च्चसम् ॥",
    "54079": "Thus अवतमसम्, सन्तमसम्, अन्धतमसम् ॥",
    "54080": "Thus श्वोवसीयसम्, श्वःश्रेयसम् ॥ These compounds belong to the class of <i>Mayuravyansakadi</i> [[2.1.72]] The word श्वः is usually employed in blessing or praising the object expressed by the second term. Thus श्वः श्रेयसम् ते भूयात् = शोभनं श्रेयस्ते भूयात् ॥ The word श्वोवसीयसम् is a synonym of श्वः श्रेयसम् ॥ The word वसीयः is derived from वसु meaning \"praiseworthy\", \"rich\", by adding the affix ईयसुन् [[5.3.57]].",
    "54081": "Thus अनुरहसम्, अवरहसम्, तप्तरहसम् ॥",
    "54082": "Thus प्रत्युरसम् = उरसि वर्त्तते ॥ This is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound, the indeclinable having the force of a <i>vibhakti</i> [[2.1.6]].\n\nWhy do we say \"when having the sense of the locative?\" Observe प्रत्युरः = प्रतिगतमुरः ॥",
    "54083": "Thus अनुगवं यानं \"the chariot suited to the length of the oxen\". This compound is formed by [[2.1.16]]. Why do we say when meaning \"the length\"? Observe, गवां पश्चाद् = अनुगु ॥",
    "54084": "The affix अच् is added and the final syllable i. e. टि is elided. Thus द्विस्तावा वेदिः \"an altar twice as big as an ordinary one\".  त्रिस्तावा वेदिः \"thrice as big as an altar\". The words are compounds of द्विः and त्रिः plus तावत् meaning \"as much\". Why do we say \"when applied to an altar\"? Observe द्विस्तावती रज्जुः, त्रिस्तावती रज्जुः ॥",

The word अहन् is also mentioned therein, but it is not taken here, for there can be no <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound of अहन् with अहन् ॥ The word पुण्य is also excluded by [[5.4.90]].

In his opinion, the <i>sutra</i> अह्नः एतेभ्यः alone would have been enough. The meaning then would have been \"the affix अच् comes after the word अहन् when preceded by these words सर्व &c\". The adding of अच् would produce the same result: as द्वि + अहन् + अच् = द्वि + अह्न् + अच् [[6.4.134]] the middle अ of अहन् is elided)) = द्व्यह्नः ॥ The only specific result which टच् would have produced was to make the feminine of these words end in long ई [[4.1.15]], and the elision of the final अन् of अह्न [[6.4.145]]. But the compounds of अहन् are masculine always [[2.4.29]], they can have no feminine: and as the desired form is द्व्यह्नः, the <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.145]] cannot apply.

To this we reply, that the construction of the <i>sutra</i> shows that the feminine राज्ञी is not to be taken. Because अहन् being a prosodially lighter word than राजन् ought to have been placed first in the compound. Its not being so placed indicates that that form राजन् only is to be taken whose final vowel becomes lengthened into आ in compounding with अहन्, i.e. राजा + अहन् ; and not राज्ञी + अहन् ॥",

The न is changed to ण by [[8.4.29]].",
    "61001": "Upto <i>Sutra</i> [[6.1.12]] inclusive it is to be understood that for the first syllable two are to be made, i. e. the first syllable is to be reduplicated. This is an adhikara <i>sutra</i> : all the three words viz, एकाचः, and द्वे and प्रथमस्य are to be read in the subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto [[6.1.12]], before the rule of <i>Samprasarana</i> begins. Thus <i>Sutra</i> [[6.1.8]] says \"when लिट् follows, of an unreduplicated verbal root\". The sense of this <i>sutra</i> is incomplete, unless we supply the three words of this <i>sutra</i>, when it will read thus : \"when लिट् follows, there are two in the room of the first portion, containing a single vowel of an unreduplicated verbal root\". Thus from जागृः-जजागार (जागृ + णल् [[4.3.82]] = जा + जागृ + अ = ज + जागर् + अ [[7.4.59]] = जजागार \"lie awoke\"). So also पपाच्, इयाय, आर from the roots पच्, इ and ॠ ॥ The reduplication takes place through the force of the affix that follows. Thus the affixes of the Perfect Tense (लिट्), the Desiderative (सन्), the Intensive (यङ्), the श्लु <i>vikarana</i>, the Aorist in चङ्; all cause reduplication.\n\nThe word एकाच means that which consists of one vowel (अच्) ॥ When a stem or root consists of more than one vowel (is a dissyllabic or polysyllabic root), then the एकाच् प्रथमः will be the first syllable: as in जागृ the portion आ is the प्रथम एकाच् 'the first portion consisting of one vowel'. When a root consists of a single vowel, as इ 'to go', then strictly speaking there cannot be any portion which may be called first (प्रथम) or <i>ekach</i> consisting of a single vowel). Here, however, will this rule be applied and इ will be reduplicated, according to the maxim \"व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन्\" - \"An operation which affects something on account of some special designation which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\". So also in पच् there is no first syllable strictly speaking, but still the rule will apply under the above maxim. In making Reduplications the Rule [[1.1.59]] should always be borne in mind. Thus पच् + अ (णल् of लिट्) = पाच् पाच् + अ = प पाच् + अ [[7.4.59]] and [[7.4.60]] = पपाच ॥\n\nThe word द्वि in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the very word-form is to be doubled or pronounced-twice, and not that another word of similar meaning is substituted. In fact this is not a rule ordaining substitution of two, in the room of one; but of the repetition of the one. Compare [[8.1.1]].",
    "61002": "This debars the reduplication of the first syllable. In a verbal root beginning with a vowel, and consisting of more than one syllable, the second syllable is to be reduplicated and not the first. Thus the सनन्त root अटिष, (अट् + सन् = अट् + इट् + सन् [[7.2.35]] = अटिष), reduplicates the second syllable टिष् and the 3rd per. sing is अटि टिषति, the ष् being elided by [[7.4.60]]: and स changed to ष by [[8.3.59]]. So also अशिशिषति, अरिरिषति ॥ The last form is thus evolved, ॠ + सन् = ऋ + इट् + सन् [[7.2.74]] = अर + इ + स [[7.3.84]], and [[6.1.51]]. Here now we have to make reduplication, and if [[1.1.59]] be applied, then since a vowel affix इ follows, the reduplication of अर should take place i. e. the ॠ the <i>sthani</i> should be reduplicated. But we have explained the <i>sutra</i> द्विर्वचनेऽचि [[1.1.59]], by the phrase द्विर्वचननिमित्तेऽचि, i. e. the vowel-affix causing reduplication. Here the vowel-affix इट् does not cause reduplication, but the consonant-affix सन् that does so. Therefore rule [[1.1.59]] does not apply, for इट् itself is a कार्यी, and the maxim applies कार्यमनुभवन्हि कार्यी निमित्ततया नाश्रीयते \"surely that which undergoes an operation can, so for as it undergoes that operation, not be made the cause of the application of a grammatical rule\". Thus from the root शीङ् is formed शयिता; here the root शी is gunated before the augment इट्. Rule [[1.1.5]] declaring the prohibition of gunation with regard to कित् or ङित् words does not apply here. For though शीङ् has an indicatory ङ, yet as it undergoes an operation itself, it cannot be the cause of the application of another rule.\n\nSome persons explain the word अजादेः as the Ablative singular (and not Genitive Singular) of अजादिः and they consider the word as a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound and not a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound. According to them the word means:-\"The syllable following the initial vowel is reduplicated\". (अच्चासावादिश्वेत्यजादिः, अजादेरुत्तरस्य एकाचो द्वे भवतः) ॥ According to this interpretation, the word द्वितीयस्य is merely explanatory.",
    "61003": "The word <i>dvitiyasya</i> \"of the second syllable\", is understood here. This <i>sutra</i> debars the doubling of the consonants <i>n</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>r</i> when forming parts of the second syllable, provided these letters occur in the beginning of a conjunct (<i>sanyoga</i>) letter. Thus the Desiderative root of उन्द is उन्दिष, formed by adding सन् and इट् ॥ The second syllable here is न्दिष् which is to be reduplicated by the last rule. But in doing so, न् will not be doubled. Thus we get the form उन्दिदिषति; so also from अड्ड् and अर्च् we have अड्डिडिषति, and अर्चिचिषति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when न्, द् and र् are the letters\"? Observe ईचिक्षिषते from ईक्ष् in which क् is the initial letter and has been reduplicated in to च् ॥ Why do we say \"being the first letter in a conjunct consonant\"? Observe प्राणिणिषति from the root अन् 'to breathe', the न् being changed into ण् by [[8.4.19]] and [[8.4.21]]. The phrase अजादेः of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also. Thus दरिद्रासति ॥ Some explain the word अजादेः understood in this <i>sutra</i> in the same way as in the last, namely as a <i>karmadharaya</i> compound in the Ablative singular. They do so, in order to explain the form इन्दिद्रीयिषति, which is thus evolved इन्द्रमिच्छति = इन्द्र + क्यच् [[3.1.8]] = इन्द्रीय ॥ Then इन्द्रीयितुमिच्छति = इन्द्रीय + सन् ॥ Here though the second syllable consists of <i>n</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>r</i>, yet न् alone is rejected in reduplication and not द and र also, as द and र are not immediately after the initial vowel (अजादि) इ in this case.\n\nVart:- This prohibition should be stated with regard to the letter ब् also. As उब्ज् — उब्जिजिषति ॥ This prohibition applies when the word is taught primarily as having a penultimate ब् ॥ But when it is taught as primarily having a penultmate द, then the rule does not apply: the ब should then be ordained as a substitute of द ॥ See <i>Tudadi</i> root 20.\n\nVart:-There is no prohibition of the र when it is followed by य ॥ Thus अरार्यते ॥ This is the Intensive form of the verb ॠ, and is thus evolved: ॠ + यङ् (III. 1. 22. Vart) = अर् + य [[7.4.30]] = अर्य, then follows reduplication by the rules of this <i>sutra</i>. The second syllable र्य has an initial र which is not however rejected in reduplication.\n\nVart:- In the case of the verb ईर्ष्यति the third should be reduplicated. \"Third of what\"? Some say the third of the consonants, and according to them the form is ईर्ष्यियिषति ॥ Some say the third syllable, therefore of the root ईर्ष्यिष (ईर्ष्य + इट् + सन्), the third syllable ष is reduplicated: Thus ईर्ष्यिषष, ईर्ष्यिषिष [[7.4.79]] the अ of ष is changed into short इ by [[7.4.79]] = ईर्ष्यिषिषति ॥\n\nVart:- The third syllable of the verbs कण्डूय &c. is to be reduplicated. Thus कण्डूय + इट् + सन् = कण्डूयिष = कण्डूयियिषति; so also असूयियिषति &c.\n\nVart:- The third syllable of verbs derived from nouns is optionally reduplicated. Thus अश्वीयियिषति or अशिश्वीयिषति ॥\n\nVart:- Others say, any syllable of a नामधातु (verbs derived from nouns) may be reduplicated. Thus from the noun पुत्र is derived the root पुत्रीय, the desiderative root of which is पुत्रीयिष, which requires reduplication. Here any syllable may be reduplicated; as. 1, पुपुत्रीयिषति, 2, पुतित्रीयिषति, 3. पुत्रीयियिषति, 4, पुत्रीयिषिषति ॥ Or there may be double and treble reduplication simultaneously as. पुपुतित्रीयियिषति ॥",
    "61004": "The word द्वे in the nominative case is understood here, but for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i> it is taken in the Genitive case i. e. द्वयोर्यः पूर्वः \"the first of the two\" ordained above. The word <i>Abhyasa</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[3.1.6]], [[6.1.7]] &c.",
    "61005": "Though the word द्वे was understood in the <i>sutra</i>, the use of the word उभे 'both' indicates that the word <i>Abhyasta</i> applies to the two taken together and not to any one of them separately. The word <i>abhyasta</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[3.4.109]], [[6.1.32]] &c. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.189]] declares \"the first vowel of an <i>Abhyasta</i> gets the <i>udatta</i> accent\". The <i>Abhyasta</i> being the collective name of the both, the accent will fall on the first and not on the second, as in ददति <i>dadati</i>, the accent is on the first अ ॥ So also by [[7.1.4]] अत् takes the place of झ after an <i>Abhyasta</i>, therefore, दद + झि = दद + अति = ददति ॥ So also ददत् [[6.4.112]].",
    "61006": "The word <i>abhyasta</i> is understood here. The verb <i>jakshi</i> and the six verbs that follow it in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, in all seven verbs, get this designation. These are जक्ष, जागृ, दरिद्रा, चकास्, शास्, देधी, and वेवी । <i>Panini</i> has overlooked वेवी and mentions only the first six. By getting the designation of <i>Abhyasta</i> these verbs get acute accent on the first syllable when followed by a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> Tense-affix not having the intermediate इट् and beginning with a vowel. Thus जा꣡ग्रति <i>ja</i>-<i>grati</i>, ज꣡क्षति <i>jakshati</i>, द꣡रिद्रति <i>daridrati</i>, चका꣡सति <i>chakasati</i>, शा꣡शति <i>sasati</i>, दी꣡ध्यते <i>didhyate</i>, and वे꣡व्यते <i>vevyate</i>.

    "61007": "There is no list of तुजादि verbs given any where. The word आदि in तुजादि therefore should be construed as \"verbs like <i>tuj</i>\".

I. 3. 6). मामहानः, अनड्वान् दाधार, स्वधां मीमाय, स तूताव ॥ This lengthening only takes place in the Vedas before some special affixes, and not every where or in secular literature. As तुतोज शबलान् हरीन् ॥",
    "61008": "The reduplication is either of the first syllable or of the second syllable according as the root begins with a consonant or a vowel. Thus पच् + णल् = पच् पच् + णल् = पपाच ॥ So also पपाठ, प्रोर्ण्णुनाव ॥ In the case of ऊर्णु, Rule [[3.1.36]] does not apply, so the Perfect of this word is not formed by adding आम् and the auxiliary verbs कृ, भू and अस्; but regularly. In fact ऊर्णु is regarded as if it was नु ॥ See <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.36]] <i>Vartika</i>. वाच्य ऊर्णोर्णुवद् भावो यङ् प्रसिद्धिः प्रयोजनं, आमश्च प्रतिषेधार्थमेकाचश्चेडुपग्रहात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say when लिट् follows? Observe कर्त्ता, हर्त्ता ॥ Why do we say \"of a <i>Dhatu</i>\"? Observe ससृवांसो विशृण्विरे, सोममिन्द्रायसुन्विरे ॥ The question arises from the fact that the root (<i>dhatu</i>) always directly precedes the affixes of the Perfect, no <i>vikarana</i> intervenes as in the case of other tenses. So there was no necessity of using the word <i>dhatu</i> in the <i>sutra</i>. To this it is replied that by [[3.4.117]], sometimes लिट् is treated as <i>sarvadhatuka</i>, and then it takes <i>vikarana</i>. As श्रु taking the <i>vikarana</i> श्नु becomes शृणु; [[3.1.74]] this whole base is not a <i>dhatu</i>, therefore when the affixes of Perfect are added there is no reduplication, and we have शृन्विरे ॥ See [[3.4.117]].\n\nWhy do we say 'of a non-reduplicate'? Observe कृष्णो नोनाव वृषभो यदीदम् । नोनूयतेर्नोनाव, i.e. it is the Perfect Tense of the Intensive verb नोनूय, and is not reduplicated again, यङ् having already caused reduplication. So also संमान्या मरुतः समिमिक्षुः ending in the उस् of the Perfect.\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> there is optionally reduplication of the root in the Perfect and other tenses. As आदित्यान् याचिषामहे or यियाचिषामहे; देवतानो दाति प्रियाणि or ददाति प्रियाणि ॥ मघवा दातु or ददातु, नस्तुतो वीरवद् धातु or दधातु ॥\n\nVart:- The root जागृ is optionally reduplicated in the Perfect. As, यो जागार (or जजागार) तमृचः कामयन्ते ॥",
    "61009": "The word सन् यङोः should be construed as genitive dual and not as Locative dual. In the latter case, the meaning would be \"when the affixes सन् and यङ् follow, a non-reduplicate root is reduplicated\". The difficulty would be that while the root alone would be reduplicated. the augment इट् would not, as in अटिटिषति, अशिशिषति ॥\n\nThe phrase धातोरनभ्यासस्य is understood here also. The reduplication is of the first or second syllable, according as the root has an initial consonant or vowel. Thus पच् + सन् (III. 1. 7.) पक्ष, reduplicate पिपक्षति [[7.4.79]]. So पत् पिपतिषति, ॠ — अरिरिषति, उन्द — उन्दिदिषति ॥ So also of यङन्तः - as, पापच्यते [[7.4.83]], अटाट्यते, यायज्यते, अरार्यते, प्रोर्ण्णोनूयते ॥ If a root is already a reduplicated one, there is no reduplication : as जुगुप्सषते, लोलूयिषते being the Desiderative forms of जुगुप्स (already formed by <i>svarthika</i> सन् [[3.1.5]], and of लोलूय (the Intensive form of लु) ॥ See (III. I. 22).",
    "61010": "The श्लु is the characteristic sign of the roots of the third class, and causes the elision of the <i>vikarana</i> शप् ॥ The reduplication is of the first or second syllable, according as the root has an initial consonant or a vowel. Thus जुहोति (from हु), बिभेति, जिह्रेति ॥",
    "61011": "The reduplication is of the first or second syllable according as the root begins with a consonant or a vowel. Thus अपीपचत्, अपीपठत्, [[7.4.93]] and [[7.4.94]]. So also आटिटत्, आशिशत्, आर्दिदत् ॥ These are aorists of the causative roots पाचि &c.\n\nWhen the Reduplicated Aorist of the Causative (ण्यन्त) verbs पच् &c is to be formed, as here, we should first elide the causative sign णि, then shorten the penultimate vowel, and then reduplicate. Then by [[7.4.93]] the effect would be like as if सन् had followed, and this would not be prohibited by the short vowel being considered <i>sthanivat</i>. For rule [[7.4.93]] says \"Let the effect be as if सन् had followed, on the reduplicate, if followed by a light vowel, of an inflective base to which णि followed by चङ् is affixed; provided there is not the elision of any letter in the <i>pratyahara</i> अक् occasioned by the affixing of णि ॥\" One of the conditions for the application of this rule is that the reduplicate must be followed by a light vowel. We have said above that the long penultimate is to be shortened before चङ् ॥ Now arises the difficulty. Should this light vowel coming in the room of a heavy vowel be considered like the heavy vowel by the rule of <i>sthanivat</i> <i>adesa</i> [[1.1.56]], or not? It should not be considered so, for the reasons given in [[1.1.57]]. For it was established there that the <i>sthanivadbhava</i> will arise then only when some operation is to be done to a thing anterior to the non-substituted i. e. original vowel. Here no operation is to be applied to something anterior to such original (अनादिष्ट) vowel, but to a form consisting of such substituted (आदिष्ट) vowel. Therefore, the light vowel is not considered non-existent for the purposes of सन्वद्भाव ॥ If this order of operation is not followed, there would arise incongruities. The order must be this: Ist the elision of णि ( VI. 4. 51) 2nd the shortening of the penultimate [[7.4.4]] 3rd the reduplication. If the reduplication take place first and the vowel be shortened, then the reduplication having taken place before the substitution of the vowel had taken place, such substitute will now be considered as <i>sthanivad</i>: the light vowel being considered as still heavy, will prevent the application of सन्वद्भाव ॥ The difficulty will be in the form of आशीशमत्, where the short is ordained after the णि ॥ If this be the order of operations, there will not be the reduplication of the second syllable टि in the word अटिटत् ? This is, however, done by [[1.1.59]]. which see.",
    "61012": "The word दाश्वान् is from the root दाशृ 'to give' with the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]], here the reduplication and the augment इट् are prohibited irregularly. As दाश्वांसो दाशुषः सुतम् (<i>Rig</i> I. 3. 7). The word साह्वान् is derived from the root सह् 'to endure', by adding the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]], the irregularity being in lengthening the penultimate, not allowing the augment इट् and the reduplication. Thus साह्वान् बलाहकः ॥ So also मीढ्वान् comes from मिढ् 'to sprinkle' with the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]] the irregularity consisting in non-reduplication, non-application of इट्, the lenghthening of the penultimate vowel, and the change of ह into ड ॥ As मीड्वस्तोकाय तनयाय मृडय ॥ It is not necessary that these words should be in the singular always, in their plural forms also they do not reduplicate.\n\nVart:- Reduplication takes place when कृञ् &c, are followed by the affix क ॥ Thus क्रियते अनेन = कृ + क = चक्रम्, क्लिद् + क = चिक्लिदम् ॥ The affix क comes after कृञ् and क्लिद् with the force of the affix घञ् ॥\n\nVart:- The roots चर्, चल्, पत्, and वद् take reduplication when followed by the affix अच् [[3.1.134]] and the reduplicate (<i>abhyasa</i>) takes the augment आक् ॥ The final consonants of the <i>Abhyasa</i> (reduplicate) are not elided in these verbs, in order to give scope to the augment, for if the final consonants be elided by [[7.4.60]], then the addition of the augment becomes unnecessary; as there is no difference between the augment and the <i>adesa</i> (shortening of the vowel) taught in [[7.4.59]]. Thus चराचरः, चलाचल, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥\n\nVart:- The above <i>vartika</i> is optional, so we have the forms चरः पुरुषः, चलो रथः, वदो मनुष्यः &c.\n\nVart:- The root हन् is reduplicated before the affix अच्, and the augment आक् comes after the <i>Abhyasa</i>, and घ is the substitute of ह of the <i>Abhyasa</i>. Thus हन् + अच् = घन् + आक् + हन् + अच् = घनाघनः (The second ह is changed into घ by [[7.3.55]]), as in the phrase घनाघनः क्षोभनश्चर्षणीनाम् ॥\n\nVart:- The causative root पाटि is reduplicated before the affix अच्, there is elision of णि (sign of the causative), and उक् is the augment of the <i>Abhyasa</i>, and it is lengthened.

Observe कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरस्य ग्रामस्य = कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरयं ग्रामः ॥ It is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound.\n\nThe affix ष्यङ् is here the feminine affix य followed by चाप् (आ) (see [[4.1.77]] and [[4.1.74]].\n\nA general maxim relating to all affixes is \"an affix denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added, and ends with the affix itself: प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहितस्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम्\"॥ This maxim, however, does not apply in case of feminine affixes, where we have this rule \"a feminine affix denotes whenever it is employed in a rule, a word-form which ends with that affix, but which need not necessarily begin with that to which the affix has been added, but where the word form is subordinate: \"स्त्रीप्रत्यये चानुपसर्जने न\"॥ Thus we have परमकारीषगन्ध्यायाः पुत्रः =  परमकारीषगन्धीपुत्रः and so also परमकारीषगन्धीपतिः ॥ Not so when the word is an <i>upasarjana</i> or subordinate in a compound. As अतिक्रान्ता कारीषगन्ध्याम् = अतिकारीषगन्ध्या, तस्य पुत्रः = अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रः, अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापतिः ॥\n\nThis vocalisation takes place when पुत्र and पति alone, not compounded with any other word, stand at the end : not so when a word beginning or ending with these words follows. Thus कारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रकुलं, कारीषगन्ध्यापरमपुत्रः &c.\n\nThough a word ending in ष्यङ् may have many semi-vowels, yet the vocalisation takes place of the affix य (ष्यङ्) only, according to the maxim निर्दिश्यमानस्यादेशा भवन्ति \"substitutes take the place of that which is actually enunciated\".\n\nThe word संप्रसारण has regulating influence upto [[6.1.44]] inclusive. The rules of vocalisation (change of semi-vowels into vowels) is contained in these <i>sutras</i>.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when पति and पुत्र follow the word गौकाक्ष्य ॥ As गौकाक्ष्यापुत्रः, गौकाक्ष्यायातः instead of गौकाक्षीपुत्रः &c.",
    "61014": "Thus कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुरस्य = कारीषगन्धीबन्धुः ॥ So also कौमुदगन्धीबन्धुः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when the compound is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>\"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्याया बन्धुः = कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुः, which is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound. Like the last <i>sutra</i>, we have here also परमकारीषगन्धबन्धुः, but अतिकारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुः, कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुधनः, कारीषगन्ध्यापरमबन्धुः ॥\n\nThough the word बन्धुनि is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> in the neuter gender, it is in fact a masculine word.\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of ष्यङ् in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound with मातच्, मातृक and मातृ optionally: as कारीषगन्धीमातः꣡ or कारीषगन्ध्यामातः꣡, कारीषगन्धीमातृकः or कारीषगन्ध्यामातृकः, कारीषगन्धीमाता, कारीषगन्ध्यामाता ॥ The indicatory च of मातच् makes the word take the <i>udatta</i> on the last syllable [[6.1.163]], thus debarring the especial accent of the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> (VI. 2. I). All <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds ending in ऋ take the <i>samasanta</i> affix कप्, so मातृ would have become मातृक by force of [[5.4.153]], so the separate enumeration of मातृ and मातृक here shows that कप् is also optional.",
    "61015": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of ष्यङ् does not run into this <i>sutra</i>. The root वच includes the वच परिभाषने of the <i>Adadi</i> class (II. 54) and the वच् substitute of ब्रू [[2.4.53]] स्वप् is the root ञिष्वप् शये of the <i>Adadi</i> class (II 59). The यजादि verbs are the last nine roots of the <i>Bhvadi</i> class viz. यज्, वप्, वह, वस्, वेञ्, ष्येञ्, ह्वेञ्, वद् and श्वि ॥ The semivowels of these eleven verbs are changed into the corresponding vowel, when an affix having an indicatory क is added to them. Thus with the Past Participle affixes क्त and क्तवतु third we have the following forms:- वच् -उक्तः, उक्तवान् , [[8.2.30]]. 2 स्वप् - सुप्तः, सुप्तवान् 3 यज् - इष्टः, इष्टवान्. [[8.2.36]] 4 वप् -उप्तः, उप्तवान्, 5 वह् - ऊढः, ऊढवान् [[8.2.31]], [[8.2.40]], [[8.3.13]] and [[6.3.111]] 6 वस् - ऊषितः ऊषितवान्, [[7.2.56]] [[8.3.60]] 7 वेञ् - उतः, उतवान्, 8 व्येञ् - संवीतः, संवीतवान्, 9 ह्वेञ् - हूतः, हूतवान्, 10 वद् - उदितः, उदितवान् , 11 दुओश्वि - शूनः, शूनवान् ॥\n\nधातो स्वरुपग्रहणे तत्प्रत्यय कार्ये विज्ञायतेः- When in a Grammatical rule, an operation (dependant on an affix) is taught with regard to a root (<i>dhatu</i>) by mentioning particular verbs (<i>dhatu</i>) specifically, and not by using the word \"<i>dhatu</i>\", generally, then the operation takes place only when the root is followed by such an affix as can be added to roots by emunciating the word धातोः ॥ The existence of this maxim is inferred in the formation of the word भ्रौणहत्यम् in [[6.4.174]], which see. Therefore, there is no vocalisation of वच् in the following वाच्यति, वाचिकः ॥ Here वाच्यति is formed by adding क्यच् to वाच् (वाचमिच्छति)॥ वाच् is formed by क्विप् added to वच्, the vowel being lengthened and <i>samprasarana</i> being expressly prevented by <i>Unadi</i> II. 57. Now, it is a general rule that a root taking the affix क्विप्, विट्, or विच् does not lose its character of a <i>dhatu</i>. Therefore वाच् is a root (धातु), and it ought to take vocalisation before the affix क्यच् ॥ But क्यच् is not enunciated to come after a <i>dhatu</i>, but after a सुबन्त (सुपआत्मनः क्यच् (III. I. 8)) in the rule ordaining its affixing. So also वाचिकः formed by adding ठक् to वाच् (See <i>Vartika</i> V. 3. 83).",
    "61016": "By force of the word 'च' 'and', the <i>anuvritti</i> of किति is read into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus 1. ग्रह — गृहीतः, गृहीतवान् (by क्त and क्तवतु), गृह्णाति (1. 2. 4), जरीगृह्यते (by यङ of the Intensive). 2. ज्या - जीनः, जीनवान् [[8.2.44]] त changed to न), जिनाति (1. 2. 4), the short इ is lengthened by [[6.4.2]] and is shortened again by [[7.3.80]]. जेजीयते (यङ्), 3. वयि - The root वेञ् is replaced by वय when लिट् follows [[2.4.41]]. This वयि can have no ङित् affix after it, it takes only लिट् terminations, which as we know are कित् [[1.2.5]]. The examples, therefore given will be of कित् affixes only. Thus ऊयतुः, ऊयतुः ॥ Now arises this question 'why do you enumerate वयि, for is not वेञ् (for which वयि is substituted) already included in यजादि class of verbs given in the last <i>sutra</i>, and by force of that <i>sutra</i>, वयि will get <i>samprasarana</i> before कित् affixes\". The reply is \"वयि is numerated here in order to show that the prohibition of <i>samprasarana</i> with regard to वेञ् as taught in [[6.1.40]], does not apply to its substitute वयि in the Perfect Tense\". Thus while the Perfect of वेञ् is ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः, the Perfect of its substitute वयि is ऊवाय, ऊयतुः and ऊयुः ॥ More over (VI. I. 38) teaches that the य of वय is not vocalised in लिट् affixes, which therefore, implies <i>jnapaka</i>) that the other semivowel i. e. व of वय will be vocalised. 4. व्यध - विद्धः, विद्धवान्, and with ङित् affixes विध्यति, वेविध्यते ॥ 5. वश - उशितः, उशितवान्, and with ङित् affixes उष्टः, उशन्ति ॥ 6. व्यचः - विचितः, विचितवान् विचति, वेविच्यते ॥ By a <i>Vartika</i> under [[1.2.1]], the word व्यच is considered to belong to कुटादि class, and therefore all affixes after it, other than those having an indicatory ण्, ञ् or the affix अस्, are considered as ङित्, and therefore, there will be <i>samprasarana</i> before these affixes : as, उद्विचिता, उद्विचितुम्, उद्विचितव्यम् ॥ 7. वृश्च — वृकणः, वृकणवान् ॥ How is the final च् of व्रश्च changed into क्, for by [[8.2.36]] च ought to have been changed into ष before the झलादि affix क्त ? To this we reply the affix क्त is replaced by न [[7.2.42]] and as this न is not a झलादि affix, Rule [[8.2.36]] does not apply. This is done on the following maxim: \"The substitute of the <i>Nishtha</i> should be considered to be <i>siddha</i> or effective when applying the rules relating to the change of a letter into ष, to accent, to affix, and to the addition of the augment इट्\". But when च is to be changed into क, the substitute is considered <i>asiddha</i> (not to have taken place). Thus we have the forms वृकणः &c. Before ङित् affixes we have वृश्चति, वरीवृश्च्यते ॥ 8. प्रच्छ - पृष्टः [[8.2.36]], पृष्टवान्, ङित् -पृच्छति, परीपृच्छ्यते ॥ The forms पप्रच्छ and बभ्रञ्ज would have been evolved by the simple rules of Reduplication even, without the application of this rule. But प्रच्छ+ नङ् [[3.3.90]] प्रश्नः ॥ Here there is no vocalisation, because <i>Panini</i> himself uses the word प्रश्नः in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.117]] showing that this is the proper form though irregular. 9. भ्रस्ज - भृष्टः [[7.2.36]], भृष्टवान्, ङित् — भृञ्जति, बरीभृञ्ज्यते ॥ The स of भ्रस्ज is changed first into द by झलां जश् झशि [[8.4.53]], and then द is changed into ज by स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः [[8.4.40]].",
    "61017": "Thus वच — उवाच, उवचिथ, स्वप् — सुष्वाप, सुष्वपिथ, यज — इयाज, इयजिय, टुवप् — उवाप्, उवपिथ ॥ As regards ग्रहादि verbs; ग्रह — जग्राह, जग्रहिथ (there is no speciality in case of this verb, as these forms would have been evolved without even this rule). ज्या — जिज्यौ, जिज्यथ, वयि — उवाय, and उवयिथ; व्यध — विव्याध, विव्यधिथ, वश — उवाश, उवशिथ, व्यच् — विव्याच, विव्यचिथ, व्रश्च — वव्रश्च and वव्रश्चिथ ॥ Some say that with regard to व्रश्च, it is equal whether there existed this present rule or not. For they argue thus, व्रश्च + णल् = व्रश् + व्रश्च् + अ = व + व्रश्च् + अ (हलादि शेषः [[7.4.60]]) = वव्रश्च ॥ To this we reply, this form would be evolved no doubt had this rule not existed. But when this rule is applied, and you make reduplication without first vocalising the र, then you will have to vocalise व by force of this rule. Hence the necessity of this rule with regard to व्रश्च also, for having changed र into ॠ, we have वृव्रश्च् and then change ॠ into अ by [[7.4.66]]. Then this अ substitute becomes <i>sthanivat</i> to ॠ [[1.1.59]], and therefore there is no vocalisation of this व, for rule [[6.1.37]], prevents the vocalisation of a letter standing before one which has already been vocalised. There is no speciality with regards to प्रच्छ and भ्रस्ज verbs.\n\nThis vocalisation of the reduplicate is taught with regard to those affixes which are not कित् ॥ With regard to कित् affixes, the Rule [[6.1.15]] will apply. And as the rule of vocalisation is subsequent to that of reduplication in order, therefore by the maxim of परत्व [[1.4.2]], vocalisation will take place first and then reduplication, according to the maxim पुनः प्रसङ्ग विज्ञानात्सिद्धम् \"occasionally the formation of a particular form is accounted for by the fact that a preceding rule is allowed to apply again, after it had previously been superseded by a subsequent rule\". Thus वच् + अतुः (which is कित् [[1.2.5]]) = उच् + अतुः = उच् + उच् + अतुः = ऊचतुः, ऊचुः ॥\n\nThough the phrase उभयेषाम् could have been supplied into this <i>sutra</i> by the context and the governing scope of the preceding <i>sutras</i>, its express mention in this <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of indicating, that the rule of vocalisation supersedes even the rule of हलादिः शेषः [[7.4.60]], the vocalisation must take place at all events. Thus व्यध + णल् = व्य + व्यध + अ ॥ Here by [[7.4.60]], the second consonant य of व्य ought to have been elided, and the equation would have stood व + व्यध् + अ, and there would have been vocalisation of व by this rule. But that is not intended; there is vocalisation of य and we have विव्याध ॥ In fact, the universal maxim of vocalisation is :-\"The <i>samprasarana</i> and the operations dependent on it possess greater force than other operations which are simultaneously applicable\". संप्रसारणं तदाश्रयं च कार्यम् बलवत् ॥",
    "61018": "Thus the Aorist of स्वपि is असूषुपत्, असूषुपताम्, असूषुपन् ॥ The vocalisation takes place before reduplication, then there is <i>guna</i> of the penultimate short vowel, then this is again shortened by [[7.4.1]], then there is reduplication, and then lengthening of the vowel of the reduplicate by [[7.4.94]]. Thus स्वापि + चङ् = सुपि + चङ् = सुप् [[6.4.51]] + चङ् [[7.3.86]] = सोप् + चङ् = सुप् + चङ् [[7.4.1]] = सु + सुप् + चङ् [[6.1.11]] = सूषुपत् [[7.4.94]] which with the augment अ becomes असूषुपत् ॥  \n\nWhy do we say 'when चङ् follows'?

    "61020": "The word यङि is understood here. As वावश्यते, वावश्येते, वावश्यन्ते ॥ Why do we say \"when यङ् follows\"? Observe उष्टः, उशन्ति ॥ See (VI. I. 16) to which this rule is an exception.",
    "61021": "The phrase यङि is understood here. Thus चेकीयते, चेकीयेते, चेकीयन्ते ॥ The exhibition of की in the <i>sutra</i> with a long ई indicates that there is long vowel even in tenses where यङ् is elided, as चेकीतः ॥ For if the <i>sutra</i> had enunciated कि with a short इ as the substitute of चाय्, the forms चेकीयते &c would have been still valid. Thus कि + यङ् = चि + कि + य = चे + कि + य = चे + की + य [[7.4.25]] causing the lengthening of the short इ). But then the <i>Nishtha</i> would have been चेकितः which is wrong.",

I. 29).",
    "61023": "The phrases \"when the <i>nishtha</i> follows\", and \"there is vocalisation\" are understood here. The <i>anuvritti</i> of स्फी does not run here.

I. 108) = प्रस्तीतः [[6.4.2]], and प्रस्तीतवान् ॥ The त of <i>nishtha</i> affix would have been changed into न् by [[8.2.43]] in as much as the root स्त्या has a semivowel and ends in long आ ॥ But by the vocalisation of य, the condition of यण्वत् for the application of [[8.2.43]], no longer existing, the affix त is not changed to न ॥ But त is optionally changed to म by [[8.2.54]] as प्रस्तीमः and प्रस्तीमवान् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when preceded by प्र?\" Observe संस्त्यानः [[8.2.43]], संस्त्यानवान् ॥ If it was intended that vocalisation should take place when प्र singly stood before, then the <i>sutra</i> could well have run thus प्रस्त्यः ॥ The use of the word पुर्वस्य implies that the rule applies when प्र stands first, though other <i>upasargas</i> may intervene between it and the root. Thus प्रसंस्तीतः, प्रसंस्तीतवान् ॥  The compound प्रपूर्वस्य should be explained as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>= प्रः पूर्वो यस्य धातूपसर्गसमुदायस्य स प्रपूर्व (that which consisting of root and <i>upasarga</i> is preceded by प्र is called प्रपूर्व). Therefore the rule is made applicable to प्रसंस्तीतः &c.",
    "61024": "The word द्रवमूर्त्ति means hardening of a fluid, by coagulation &c. Thus शीनं घृतं, शीना वसा, शीनं मेदः \"a coagulated butter, grease &c\". The त of <i>nishtha</i> is changed to न by [[8.2.47]]. But when the sense is that of 'cold', the त is not changed; as शीतं वर्त्तते, शीतो वायुः, शीतमुदकम् ॥ The word शीत is here used both as a noun meaning 'cold weather &c', and an adjective denoting 'cold'. There is no vocalisation when the sense is not that of 'coagulation' or 'cold', as संश्यानो वृश्चिकः 'the rolled up scorpion'. The short इ is lengthened in शीन &c, by [[6.4.2]].",

Thus अभिसंशीनं or अभिसंश्यानं, अवसंशीनं, अवसंश्यानं ॥ According to the author of <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>, the word पूर्व shows that it is a <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>, hence there is no option allowed when अभि and अव are in the middle, as, समभिश्यानं, समवश्यानं ॥ Here we cannot have the alternative forms समभिशीनं &c.",

In all these, शृ replaces श्रा, whether causative or not. Thus शृतं क्षीरं, शृतं हविः ॥ This is a <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>; so that श्रा is invariably changed to शृ when referring to क्षीर and हवि, but not anywhere else. Thus श्राणा यवागूः, श्रपिता यवागूः [[7.3.36]] and [[6.4.92]]. This word does not take double causative though the sense may require it. As श्रपितं क्षीरं देवदत्तेन यज्ञदत्तेन \"<i>Devadatta</i> through <i>Yajnadatta</i> has caused the milk to be cooked\". The श्रा is intransitive.

The root would have taken vocalisation before लिट्, which is a कित् affix, invariably by [[6.1.15]], this <i>sutra</i> modifies that by making the substitution optional. In the alternative, when the root does become vocalised, the reduplicate is also not vocalised in spite of [[6.1.17]]. This explains the form शिश्वाय, which by [[6.1.17]] would have been शुश्वाय ॥ श्वि + णल् = (श् उद्व + णल् [[6.1.30]]) = शु + णल् [[6.1.108]] = शु + शु + अ [[6.1.8]] = शुशाव ॥",
    "61031": "The phrase विभाषा श्वेः is understood here. In forming the Desiderative and the Reduplicated Aorist forms of the Causative of श्वि, there is optional vocalisation. Thus शुशावयिषति or शिश्वाययिषति ॥ So also in the Reduplicated Aorist चङ्, as अशृशवत् or अशिश्वयत् ॥ By the maxim संप्रसारणं संप्रसारणाश्रयं च बलीयो भवति (see <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.17]]), the <i>antaranga</i> substitution of <i>Vriddhi</i> &c is superseded by the <i>samprasarana</i> and the subsidiary operations relating to it here. The <i>vriddhi</i> and the substitution of आव take place after the <i>samprasarana</i> has taken place. The <i>sutra</i> [[7.4.80]] teaching the substitution of ई for the उ of the reduplicate, when सन् follows, shows by implication that the substitution caused by णि is <i>sthanivat</i> though it itself does not cause reduplication [[1.1.59]]. Thus श्वि + णि = श्वै + इ = श्वाय् + इ = श्वायि ॥ In reduplicating श्वायि we cannot form श्वाश्वाय, but must consider the substitute equal to the original इ of श्वि and must reduplicate it. We thus get शिश्वाययिषति ॥ In the case of vocalisation, the rules of <i>Vriddhi</i> &c are postponed. Thus श्वि + णि + सन् (VI. I. 108) = शु + णि + सन् = शौ + इ + सन् = शाव् + इ + इट् + सन् = शावे + इट् + सन् = शावयि + सन् ॥ Here we require reduplication. Here the substitute आव् in शाव् though not caused by सन्, is treated <i>sthanivat</i> under [[1.1.59]] to उ, which is carried in reduplication. Similarly the Aorist. श्वि + णि + चङ् = शु + इ + अ = शु + शु + इ + अ = शु + शौ + इ + अ = शु + शाव् + इ + अ = शु + शव् + इ + अ [[7.4.1]] = शु + शव् + ० + अ [[6.4.51]] = अशूशवत् [[7.4.94]]",

As, इन्द्रश्च विष्णो यदपस्पृधेथाम् ॥ In secular language the form is अस्पर्धेथाम् ॥ Some say, it is derived from स्पर्द्ध with the preposition अप, the vocalisation of र, the elision of अ, and the non-prefixing of the augment अट् in the Imperfect [[6.4.75]]. The counter-example of this will be अपास्पर्द्धेथाम् ॥ From अर्च and अर्ह 'to respect, to worship', are derived आनृचुः and आनृहुः in the Perfect before the 3rd person plural उस्, there being vocalisation of र and the elision of अ irregularly. Then there is reduplication, then ॠ changed to अ, then the lengthening of this अ, then the addition of the augment म, as : अर्च् + उस् = ॠच् + उस् = ॠ + ॠच् + उस् + अ + ॠच् + उस् [[7.4.66]] = आ + ॠच् + उस् [[7.4.70]] = आ + न् + ॠच् + उस् [[7.4.71]] = आनृचुः ॥ The irregularity consists in the <i>samprasarana</i> with the elision of अ ॥ Thus यवग्रा अर्कमानृचुः, न वसून्यानृहुः ॥ The secular forms will be अनर्चुः, आनर्हुः ॥ The form चिच्युषे is the Perfect 2nd person singular of the root च्युङ् 'to go': there is vocalisation of the reduplicate, and the non-addition of the augment इट् before the affix से ॥ This is the irregularity. The regular form is चुच्युविषे ॥ The form तित्याज is the Perfect of त्यज्, the vocalisation of the reduplicate is the irregularity. The regular form is तत्याज ॥ From the root श्रीञ् 'to cook', is derived श्राता before the <i>Nishtha</i> affix, श्री changed to श्रा irregularly. As श्रातास्त इन्द्रसोमाः ॥ The form श्रितं is also derived from the same root by shortening the vowel with the same affix. As सोमो गौरी अधिश्रितः, श्रिता नो गृहाः ॥ Some say the श्रा substitution of श्री takes place when the word refers to सोम, in the plural, and श्रि when it refers to other than सोम ॥ Sometimes the word श्रातः is seen in the singular, referring to objects other than सोम । Thus यदि श्रातो जुहोतन ॥ In fact, the exhibition of the word श्राताः in the plural in the <i>sutra</i> is not absolutely necessary. The words आशीर् and आशीर्त्तः are from the same root श्री, with the prefix आङ् and taking the affixes क्विप् and क्त respectively. Before these श्री is replaced by शीर्, and the non-addition of न in the <i>Nishtha</i> is irregular. As, तामाशीरा दुहन्ति आशीर्त्त ऊर्ज्जम्, क्षीरैर्मध्यत आशीर्त्तः ॥",
    "61037": "Thus व्यध्; has two semi-vowels व् and य्; when य् is once vocalised into इ, the preceding व will not be vocalised into उ ॥ Thus we have विद्धः ॥ From व्यच् — विचितः, व्येञ् — संवीतः ॥ Though the rule of vocalisation does not specify what particular semivowel is to be vocalised, yet according to the maxim that the operation is to be performed on the letter nearest to the operator, the second semivowel in the above cases is vocalised and the first is not, by force of this rule. Had the first semi-vowel been vocalised, then there would be no scope for this <i>sutra</i>, because then no semi-vowel will be found preceding a vocalised letter. This <i>sutra</i> is a <i>jnapaka</i> that the vocalisation commences with the second of the conjunct semi-vowels.\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of संप्रसारण was understood here, the repetition of this word shows that the prohibition of double vocalisation in the same word applies even when the semivowels are not contiguous. Thus by [[6.1.133]] there is vocalisation of the word युवन्, the व being changed to उ, the य is not changed as यूना ॥ It might be objected that when the उ of यु, and उ the <i>samprasarana</i> of व coalesce into one by <i>sandhi</i> rules, then there being the substitution of one long ऊ for the two उ's and this is <i>sthanivat</i> to the original, the य  and व् of युवन् should be considered in fact as contiguous and not separated by an intervening letter, and therefore, the explanation given above does not hold good; we reply. The substitution of one long vowel for two vowels, is not considered <i>sthanivat</i> (See (l. 1.58)). Even though it be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, it is still a separating letter.\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of the semivowel of त्रि when followed by ऋच्, and there is elision of the ऋ of ऋच्, when it refers to Metres. As तिस्र ॠचो यस्मिन् = तृचं सुक्तं ॥ तृचं साम ॥ The word तृच् takes the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ by [[5.4.74]]. Why do we say when referring to a metre? Observe त्यृचं कर्म ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> there is diversely vocalisation of the semi-vowel of रयि followed by the affix मतुप् as रयि + मत् = रइ + मत् = र + इ + मत् = र + इ + वत् [[8.2.15]] = रवेत्; as, आ रेवानेतु नो विशः ॥ Sometimes it does not take place, as रयिमान् पुष्टिवर्द्धनः ॥ The म here is not changed to व as required by [[8.2.15]].\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of कक्ष्या before मत् when a Name is meant: as कक्षीवन्तं य औशिजः ॥ This <i>Vartika</i> is unnecessary. See [[8.2.12]] where the form कक्षीवत् is given.",
    "61038": "The phrase न संप्रसारणं is understood here. Thus उवाय, ऊयतुः, ऊयुः ॥ The word लिट् is employed in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent <i>sutras</i>, this one could have done well without it even.",
    "61039": "Thus ऊयतुः or ऊवतुः, ऊवुः or ऊयुः ॥ According to <i>Patanjali</i>, the phrase वश्चास्य of this <i>sutra</i> could have been dispensed with; this much would have been enough:- अन्यतरस्या किति वेञः ॥ Thus वे + अतुम् = वा + वा + अतुस् = ववतुः and ववुः (the vocalisation being prohibited). In the alternative:-वा + अतुस् = उ +अतुस् = उ + उवङ् + अतुस् [[6.1.77]] = ऊवतुः, ऊवुः ॥ Here there is vocalisation. In the case of वय् substitute, the य is never vocalised, so we have ऊयतुः, ऊयुः ॥ Thus all the three forms have been evolved without using वश्चास्य ॥",
    "61040": "Thus ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः ॥ This root belongs to यजादि class and would have been vocalised before कित् affixes by [[6.1.15]]; and before non-कित् affixes the Reduplicate syllable of the Perfect would have been vocalised by [[6.1.17]]. Both vocalisations are prohibited here.",
    "61041": "Thus प्रवाय, उपवाय ॥ The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, into which the <i>anuvritti</i> of ल्यप् only runs.",

    "61044": "Thus परिवीय यूपम् or परिव्याय ॥ The augment तुक् presented by (VI. I. 71) is debarred by (VI. 4. 2.) which causes the lengthening of the vowel: since [[6.4.2]] is subsequent to [[6.1.71]].",
    "61045": "The word धातोः is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> from [[6.1.8]]. Thus ग्लौग्लाता, ग्लातुम्, ग्लातव्यम्, शौ - निशाता, निशातुम्, निशातव्यम् ॥ Why do we say ending with an एच् (diphthong)? Observe कर्त्ता from कृ, and हर्त्ता from हृ ॥ Why do we say in <i>upadesa</i> or <i>Dhatupatha</i> ? Observe चेता, स्तोता where चे and स्तो are not the forms taught in the first enunciation of the root in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, but are secondary forms. Why do we say, before non-शित् affixes? Observe ग्लै + शप् + तिप् = ग्लायति, म्लायति ॥ Exception is, however, made in the case of the affix एश् of the Perfect: as जग्ले, मम्ले ॥ This is explained by interpreting the word शित् as शिदादि, that is the affixes having an indicatory श in the beginning: एश् has श् at the end. This is done on the maxim यस्मिन् विधिस्तदादावल् ग्रहणे \"when a term which denotes a letter is exhibited in a rule in the form of the Locative case, and qualifies some thing else which likewise stands in the Locative case, that which is qualified by it must be regarded as beginning with the letter which is denoted by the term in question and not as ending with it\".\n\nThe word अशिति is an example of प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः. a simple prohibition of a contingent case. Therefore, the substitution of आ for एच् vowels, is not caused by the affixes that follow, but must take place prior to the occasion for the application of the affixes arises. Thus [[3.1.136]] ordains क after roots ending in आ; so that ग्लै and म्लै are presupposed to end in आ when applying this affix: thus सुग्लः, सुम्लः ॥ Similarly by [[3.3.128]] we apply युच् to ग्लै and म्लै by presupposing it as आदन्त roots: as सुग्लानः, सुम्लानः ॥\n\nThe word आ is understood in all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto (VI. I. 57).",

    "61049": "The word पारलौकिक is derived from परलोक 'the next world' by adding the affix ठञ् with the force of 'for the sake of' [[5.1.109]]. The double <i>Vriddhi</i> takes place by [[7.3.20]]. The sense of the word सिध् must refer to अज्ञान or non-intelligent things for the purposes of this substitution. Thus अन्नं साधयति, ग्रामं साधयति ॥ Why do we say when not referring to the next world ? See तपस्तापसं सेधयति, स्वान्येवनं कर्माणि सेधयन्ति ॥ The force of सिध is here that of knowledge, तापसः सिद्ध्यति = ज्ञानावशेषमासादयति ॥ The ascetic acquires certain knowledge through austerities, the knowledge so acquired produces its result in the next world (परलोक) i. e. the next life, therefore, the साधन of the ascetic is for the sake of the next life, and so there is no substitution of आ for ए ॥ Why the substitution does not take place here : अन्नं साधयति, ब्राह्मणेभ्योदास्यामि 'he causes food to be prepared for the purpose of giving to the <i>Brahmanas</i>'. Here though the gist of the food produces effect in the next world, yet as that is the effect of दान and not of the verb सिध्, the substitution does take place. When the verb सिध् directly and not through the mediation of another action, produces <i>paraloukika</i> effect, then the substitution does not take place. The verb सिध् here belongs to the <i>Divadi</i> class and not to the <i>Bhvadi</i>, as the form सिध्यति in the <i>sutra</i> shows it.",

Thus प्रमाता, प्रमातव्यम्, प्रमातुम्, प्रमाय, निमाता, निमातुम्, निमातव्यम्, निमाय, उपदाता, उपदातव्यम्, उपदातुम्, उपदाय ॥ The substitution of आ being understood to have taken place in the very उपदेश (in the <i>dhatupatha</i>) of these roots, the affixes relating to roots ending in इ or ई do not apply to these at all. Thus उपदायो वर्त्तते, ईषदुपदानं, formed by घञ् and युच् by taking दी = दा and adding these affixes [[3.3.128]] and [[3.3.18]] and not the affixes अच् [[3.3.56]] and खल् [[3.3.126]].",

The same is the case with all the roots subsequently taught, thus खिद् will be खेद्, and then ए changed to आ, गुर् = गोर् and ओ changed to आ &c. Therefore we have employed the <i>anuvritti</i> of एच् 'diphthong' in all <i>sutras</i>. The words ल्याप and आदेच उपदेश are understood here. The roots ली belonging to <i>Divadi</i> and <i>Kriyadi</i> are both included here. Thus विलाता, विलातुम्, विलातव्यम्, विलाय, विलेता विलेतुम्, विलेतव्यम् and विलीय ॥\n\nVart:- The आ substitution does not take place when the affix अच् [[3.3.56]], (III.

Observe वर्ढा, वर्ढुम्, वर्ढव्यम्, from वृहू उद्यमने which is exhibited as उदात्त, and because it has an indicatory ऊ it takes इट् optionally. Why do we say 'having a penultimate ॠ letter'? Observe भेत्ता, छेत्ता ॥ Why do we say 'before an affix beginning with a mute or a sibilant'? Observe तर्पणम्, दर्पणम् ॥ Why do we say 'not having an indicatory क'?

Again in forming the feminine of हास्तिशीर्षिः by adding ष्यङ् (IV. I.78), arises this difficulty :- ष्यङ् (य) is a <i>Taddhita</i> affix beginning with य, when this is applied to हास्तिशीर्षिः, we must apply the last rule and change the शीर्ष into शीर्षन् (for शीर्षन् being the substitute of शिरस् is prima facie a substitute of शीर्ष also for the purposes of that rule (VI. I. 61)). The form which we get will be this, हास्तिशीर्षिः + ष्यङ् = हास्तिशीर्षण् + य (VI. I. 61) = हास्तिशीर्षण्या [[6.4.168]]. But this is a wrong form, the desired form is हास्तिशीर्ष्या ॥ How do we explain this? Thus हास्तिशीर्षि + ष्यङ् = हास्तिशीर्ष् + य (the इ is elided by [[6.4.148]] and in the room of इ we substitute a zero or लोपादेश)॥ Now this <i>adesa</i> becomes <i>sthanivat</i> to इ, thus the affix य not being directly applied to शीर्ष, because this zero intervenes, शीर्ष is not replaced by शीर्षन् as required by [[6.1.61]], for it is not followed by an affix beginning with य but by a zero <i>sthanivat</i> to इञ् affix.\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is not of <i>Panini</i>, but is really a <i>Vartika</i> raised to the rank of a <i>sutra</i> by later authors.",

This appears cumbersome no doubt, but the spelling of the roots with ष is for the sake of brevity.

So also व is elided in the following :-- from जीव् - जीरदानुः (by <i>Unadi</i> affix जीवे रदानुक्) from स्रिव् -अस्रेमाणम् formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix मनिन् with the negative अ ॥ There being diversity in the application of <i>Unadi</i> affixes [[3.3.1]], there is not substitution ऊठ् for व् as required by [[6.4.19]].\n\nWhy do we say \"before any consonant except य?\" Observe ऊय्यते, क्नूय्यते when य् is not elided. Why the word लोप is placed first? The elision of व् and ल् should take place prior to the elision of the <i>aprrikta</i> व् taught in the next <i>sutra</i>. Thus कण्डूय + क्विप् = कण्डू य् [[6.4.48]] = कण्डू + त् = कण्डूः ॥ So लोलूय + क्विप् = लोलूः ॥ \"Why व् of व्रश्च is not elided before र् which is a वल् consonant? It is not elided, because it is so taught. Had the elision of व् been intended, the root would have been enunciated as रश्च instead of व्रश्च ॥ If you say the व is taught for the sake of forms like वृश्चति by <i>samprasarana</i> and वव्रश्च by reduplication, here also the '<i>lopa</i>' would have applied, as being an <i>Antaranga</i> rule, while <i>samprasarana</i>, and the elision of र् by हलादिशेषः are <i>Bahiranga</i>.",
    "61067": "The affix वि includes क्विप्, क्विन्, ण्वि &c. In all these, the real affix is व्, which being an <i>aprikta</i> [[1.2.41]], is elided. Thus ब्रह्महा, भ्रूणहा [[3.2.87]]. Here the affix क्विप् is elided. So also घृतस्पृक्, तैलस्पृक् [[3.2.58]]. Here the affix क्विन् is elided. So also अर्धभाक्, पादभाक्, तुरीयभाक् [[3.2.62]]. Here the affix ण्वि is elided.\n\nWhy do we say \"of an <i>aprikta</i>-an affix consisting of a single letter\"? Observe दर्विः formed by the affix विन् (वि being the real affix); so also जागृविः formed क्विन्, see <i>Unadi</i> <i>Sutras</i> IV. 53. 44. No root can become a noun unless some <i>krit</i> affix is added to it (see [[1.2.45]] and [[1.2.46]]); hence the necessity of these imaginary affixes, in order to raise certain roots bodily, without any change, to the rank of nouns--from <i>Dhatu</i> to a <i>Pratipadika</i> the way lies only through an affix. And though these imaginary affixes are after all totally elided, yet by [[1.1.62]], they leave their characteristic mark behind, namely the derivative word becomes a nominal stem &c. Thus च्वि words are adverbs (<i>Gati</i>) and Indeclinables.",
    "61068": "The <i>sutra</i> translated literally means :- After a word ending in a consonant, or ङी, or आप् when a long vowel, the affixes सु, ति and सि when reduced to a single consonant affix (अपृक्तं हल्) are elided. But ति and सि are elided only after a consonant and hence we have translated it as above. As examples of the elision of सु after a consonant:- राजन् + स् = राजान् [[6.4.8]] + ० = राजा, तक्षा, उखास्रत्, पर्णध्वत् ॥ After a ङी :- कुमारी, गौरी, शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ After आप् :- खट्वा, बहुराजा, कारीषगन्धा ॥ The elision of ति and सि takes place only after consonants :-as, अबिभर्भवान् (भृ + लङ् + तिप् = अ + भृ + श्लु + त् = अ + भृ + भृ + त् [[6.1.10]] = अ + भर् + भृ + त् [[7.4.66]] and [[1.1.51]] = अ + बि + भर् + त् [[7.4.60]] = अ + ब + भृ + त् [[8.4.54]] = अ + बि + भृ + त् [[7.4.76]] = अ + बि + भर् + त् [[7.3.84]] = अबिभर् + त् = अबिभर् ॥ So also अजागर् भवान् ॥ In both these cases त् of the Imperfect has been elided. The स् is elided in the following:- अभिनोऽत्र, अच्छिनोऽत्र  ॥ (भिद् + लङ् + सिप् ॥ The द् is changed into र् by [[8.2.75]] and स् is elided by this rule).\n\nWhy do we say \"after a consonant, or a feminine affix ई and आ\"? Observe ग्रामणीः, सेनानीः ॥ Why do we say \"after a long vowelled feminine affix\"? Observe निष्कौशाम्बिः, अतिखट्वः, where the feminine affixes have been shortened. Why do we say \"when followed by सु, ति and सि\"? Observe अभैत्सीत् ॥ The सि being read along with ति, does not include सिच्, but refers to सिप् only. Why do we say 'when reduced to a single letter'? Observe भिनत्ति, छिनत्ति ॥ Why do we say 'the consonant is elided'? Observe बिभेद, चिच्छेद ॥ Here the <i>aprikta</i> affix अ of the Perfect is not elided : though it being the substitute of ति is like ति, and ought to have been elided, had the word हल् not been used in the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nWhy has the elision of स् (सु), त् (तिप्) and स् (सिप्) been ordained after consonants, as they would of themselves have been dropped by [[8.2.23]], being the finals of a compound consonant? Then the forms राजा, तक्षा could not be evolved. As राजन् + स् = राजान् + स् [[6.4.8]] = राजान्स् and by eliding स् by Rule [[8.2.23]], the form would have become राजान्, and the final न् could not have been elided by [[8.2.7]]; for it is a maxim enunciated in the very opening of the Second chapter of the 8th Book, that in the last three chapters of that Book (2nd, 3rd and 4th Books), a subsequent rule is as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned; therefore, the rule [[8.2.7]] ordaining the elision of न्, does not find scope, since [[8.2.23]] (ordaining elision of स्) is considered as if it had not taken effect. So also in the case of उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत् ॥ उखा + स्रन्ग् + क्विप् [[3.2.76]] = उखा + स्रस् (the nasal being elided by [[6.4.24]]); now add सु, we have उखास्रस् + स् = उखास्रस्स; elide the final स् not by this rule, but by [[8.2.23]], we have उखास्रस्, here we cannot change the स् into द् by [[8.2.72]] for स् is not final in a <i>pada</i>, for Rule [[8.2.23]] is considered as not to have taken effect. So also in the case of अभिनोऽत्र ॥ The word अभिनः is 2nd. Person singular of the Imperfect of भिद् of <i>Rudhadi</i> class. Thus भिद् + लङ् + सिप् = अ + भिद् + श्नम् + स् = अ + भिनद् + स् = अभिनर् + स् (द changed to र् by [[8.2.75]]) = अभिनर्स् ॥ If we elide the final स् of the conjunct by [[8.2.23]], then in अभिनर् + अत्र, the र् would not be changed into उ to form अभिनोऽत्र by [[6.1.113]] since the elision of स् is considered as to have not taken effect when applying this rule. So also in अबिभर् भवान्, by Rule [[8.2.24]], there would be no <i>lopa</i> even, for संयोगान्तलोप rule is restricted by रात्सस्य [[8.2.24]], i. e. स्  only and no other consonant is elided after र्, therefore there will be no elision of त् in अबिभर्त् by [[8.2.23]].",
    "61069": "The word लोप is understood here also; as well as हल् ॥ The word अपृक्त however is not to be read here, as its repetition in [[6.1.68]] (though its <i>anuvritti</i> was there from the preceding <i>sutra</i>) indicates. The affix of Vocative is the same as that of the nominative. By [[7.3.108]], the short vowel of the stem is replaced by a <i>guna</i> vowel when the Vocative Singular affix follows. Thus we have अग्ने and वायो for अग्नि and वायु; and by [[7.3.107]], a short vowel is substituted for the long vowel ई and ऊ of the feminine: as नदि and वधु for नदी and वधू ॥ Now applying the present <i>sutra</i>, the affix स् is elided after all the above words. As हे अग्ने !, हे वायो !, हे देवदत्त !, हे नदि !, हे वधु ! The Vocative Singular of कुण्ड a Neuter noun is thus formed. By [[7.1.24]], अम् replaces स् of the nominative, the अ of अम् and the final अ of कुण्ड coalesce into one अ by [[6.1.107]], which becomes कुण्डम् ॥ Here by the rule that 'consonant' only is to be elided, we elide म् only (and not अ which becomes a part of the word by [[6.1.85]], for it is considered both as the final of the word and the initial of the affix). Now म् is not an अपृक्तं हल् for it is part of the affix अम्, and its elision would not have taken place had we read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>aprikta</i> into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus we have हे कुण्ड ! ॥ But in हे कतरत् ! there is not the elision of the त् of the affix अत्, the substitute of सु for the affix there is अद्ड् [[7.1.25]]. This affix being डित् causes the elision of the final अ of कतर [[6.4.143]], and we have कतर् + अत्, here we have not a <i>pratipadika</i> which ends in a short vowel, but in a consonant hence त् is not elided. See also (VII. I. 25). The word एङ् is used in the <i>sutra</i> in order to indicate that the <i>guna</i> substitution is stronger than <i>lopa</i>. Therefore in हे अग्नि + सु, the affix is not elided first and then <i>guna</i> substituted for इ, but first there is <i>guna</i> substitution and then the affix is elided.",
    "61070": "Thus या क्षेत्रा or यानि क्षेत्राणि, या वना or यानि वनानि ॥",
    "61071": "Thus अग्नि + चि + क्विप् = अग्निचित्, so also सोमसुत् ॥ Similarly प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य and उपस्तुत्य formed by the affix ल्यप् ॥ Why do we say \"ending in a short vowel\"? Observe आलूय, ग्रामणीः ॥ Why do we say \"having an indicatory प\"? Observe कूतम्, हृतम् ॥ Why do we say \"a <i>krit</i> affix\"? Observe पटुतरः, पटुतमः, with the <i>Taddhita</i>-affixes तरप् and तमप् ॥ In the compound ग्रामणिकुलम्, though the root is made short, yet there is no augment तुक्, in as much as the rule by which the root has been shortened is a <i>Bahiranga</i> rule, and the present rule is an <i>Antaranga</i> one. The maxim is असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे ॥ \"That which is <i>Bahiranga</i> is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is <i>Antaranga</i> is to take effect\".",
    "61072": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing <i>sutra</i>, exerting its influence upto [[6.1.158]]. What ever we shall say in the <i>sutras</i> preceding that, must be understood to apply to words which are in संहिता, that is, which are pronounced together with an uninterrupted voice. Thus दध्यत्र, मध्वत्र the इ and उ are changed to य and व when the two words are pronounced without any hiatus. Otherwise we shall have दधि अत्र, मधु अत्र ॥",
    "61073": "Thus इच्छति, गच्छति ॥ The त is change to च by [[8.4.40]]. The short vowel itself is the आगमी (the thing to which the augment is added), and not the word ending in that short vowel. Therefore in चिच्छिदतुः, चिच्छिदुः, the augment is not to be considered as part of the Reduplicate चि, but of the short इ only; and therefore it is not elided by हलादिः शेष [[7.4.60]] rule applying to reduplicates. This follows on the maxim नावयवावयवः समुदायावयवो भवति \"the part of a part cannot be considered as a part of the whole\". Here त् is a part of the <i>abhyasa</i> syllable चि which is itself a part of the verbal base, therefore त् is not considered as an <i>abhyasa</i>: or because त् being an augment of इ is considered as part of इ and not of चि of which इ is the part.",
    "61074": "The Particle आ has the four senses of 1. littleness (ईषदर्थे) 2. with verbs, as a prefix (क्रियायोगः) 3. the limit inceptive (अभिविधि) and 4. the limit exclusive (मर्यादा). This <i>sutra</i> ordains तुक् necessarily, where by [[6.1.76]], it would have been optional. Thus ईषच्छाया = आच्छाया; 2. With verbs:-as आच्छादयति, 3 and 4., आच्छायायाः, आच्छायम् ॥  So also the negative particle मा, as, माच्छैत्सीत्, माच्छिदत् ॥ The ङ् in आङ् and माङ् shows that आ when used as a <i>Gati</i> and a <i>Karmapravachaniya</i> and मा when used as a negative particle are meant. Therefore, the त् is not necessary in the following :-आछाया मानयति, प्रमाछन्दः ॥ The तुक may be optionally added in these as आच्छाया and प्रमाच्छन्दः ॥ The आ here has the force of recollection (स्मरण); आछाया \"Oh the shade\". The word प्रमा is formed from the verbal root माङ् by the prefix प्र and the affix अङ् [[3.3.106]] with the feminine affix टाप्, and the word ending in टाप् has not the indicatory ङ् ॥",
    "61075": "Thus ह्रीच्छति, म्लेच्छति, अपचाच्छायते, विचाच्छायते ॥ The augment belongs to the long vowel and not to the whole syllable ending in that long vowel.",
    "61076": "This allows option where by the last it would have been compulsory to add it. The augment is of the long vowel and not of the word ending in long vowel. Thus कूटीच्छाया or कुटीछाया, कूवलीच्छाया or कुवलीछाया ॥ The तुक् augment here is added to the end of a <i>pada</i>, and this is therefore a <i>padanta</i> rule and not a <i>pada</i>-<i>vidhi</i>. Therefore the two words need not be in construction for the application of this rule; (समर्थ पदविधि) not applying. Thus तिष्ठतु कुमारीच्छत्रं हर देवदत्तस्य, \"let the girl stay. Take the umbrella of <i>Devadatta</i>\". Here कुमारी and छत्रं are not in construction, but तुक् is still added optionally.\n\nVart:- The augment त is optional in the <i>Chhandas</i>, after the words विश्वजन &c. As, विश्वजनच्छत्रम् or विश्वजनछत्रम्, नच्छायां कुरवोपराम् or नछायां कुरवोपराम् ॥",
    "61077": "This <i>sutra</i> is rather too wide. It must be restricted by (VI. I. 101), namely the following vowel must not be of the same class as the preceding for the application of this rule. Thus दधि + अत्र = दध्यत्र, मधु + अत्र = मध्वत्र, कर्तृ + अर्थम् = कर्त्रर्थम्, हर्तृ + अर्थम् = हर्त्रर्थम्, लृ आकृति = लाकृतिः ॥\n\nVart:- This semivowel substitution of vowels takes place, when preceded by a prolated vowel, even to the supersession of [[6.1.1]] requiring lengthening. Thus अग्ना ३ इ इन्द्रं = अग्ना ३ यिन्द्रम्, पटा ३ उ उदकम् = पटा ३ वुदकम् , अग्ना ३ इ आशा = अग्ना ३ याशा, पटा ३ उ आशा = पटा ३ वाशा ॥ भो ३ इ इन्द्रम् = भो ३ विन्द्रम् ॥ The phrase 'when a vowel follows' exerts its influence upto [[6.1.108]].",

So also माण्डव्यः, शंकव्यंदारु, पिचव्यः कार्पासः, नाव्यो [[4.4.91]] हृदः ॥ Why do we say \"अव् and आव्\"? Observe रायमिच्छति = रैयति, no change of ऐ before य ॥ Why do we say \"before य\"?

Observe गोयूतिः ॥\n\nVart:- This substitution takes place when referring to the measure of a road:- as, गव्यूति मात्रमध्वानं गतः ॥ This is in the secular literature, गव्यूति meaning क्रोशयुगम् ॥",
    "61080": "The words एचः, वान्तोयि प्रत्यये are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The word तन्निमित्त means 'caused by that' i. e. caused or occasioned by that affix beginning with य ॥ Thus लू forms its Future Passive Participle by यत् [[3.1.97]], this affix causes the <i>guna</i> of ऊ by [[7.3.84]]: Thus लू + य = लो + य, which according to the present <i>sutra</i> becomes लव्यम् ॥ So also पू + य = पव्यम् ॥ लू + ण्यत् [[3.1.125]] = लौ + य = अवश्य लाव्यम् and अवश्य पाव्यम् ॥ Why do we say 'of a root'? This rule should not apply to a nominal stem. For then, though it may be all right in the case of बभ्रु + य = बाभ्रो + य = बाभ्रव्यः; it will not apply to cases like गो + य = गव्य, नौ + य = नाव्य, where ओ and औ are not caused by the affix, but are integral parts of the stem before the affixes were added. Why do we say 'caused by that affix itself'? The substitution will not take place, when the change is not caused by that affix. Thus the Passive of वे with the <i>upasarga</i> आ is आ + वे + यक् + ते = Here by <i>Samprasarana</i> [[6.1.15]], वे becomes उ; as आ + उ + य + ते; now by <i>sandhi</i> आ + उ = ओ [[6.1.87]], we have ओ + यते = ओयते ॥ Since ओ is not caused by य, there is no अव् substitution. So also औयत, लौयमानिः, पौयमानिः [[4.1.95]]. The word एव in the aphorism has the force of limitation, with regard to roots. In the case of roots, ओ and औ before य are changed then only to अव् and आव् when य has caused the production of ओ and औ; in case of nouns there is no such limitation. Here the substitution takes place whether the य has caused the production of ओ and औ or not.",
    "61081": "The roots क्षि and जि before the affix यत् [[3.1.97]] assume these forms when meaning to be able to do the action denoted by the verb. As शक्यः क्षेतुं = क्षय्यः (क्षि + य = क्षे + य); so also जय्यः ॥ Why do we say when meaning \"to be possible to do\"? Observe क्षेयं पापं, जैयो वृषलः ॥ Here the meaning is that of 'necessity'.",
    "61082": "The word क्रय्य is derive from क्री 'to buy', with the affix यत्; the <i>guna</i> ए being changed to य ॥ The word तदर्थ means 'for the purpose of that' i.e., for the purpose of being bought. As क्रय्या गौः, क्रय्यः कम्बलः ॥  Why do we say 'when the sense is that of saleable'? Observe क्रेयं नो धान्यं न चास्ति क्रय्यम् \"we want to purchase corn, but it is not put out for sale\".",
    "61083": "The word भय्य is derived from भी + यत्, and प्रवय्या from प्र + वी + यत् ॥ The <i>guna</i> ए is changed to अय् ॥ Thus भय्यं किलासीत् ॥ वत्सतरी प्रवय्या ॥ The यत् is added to भी with the force of Ablative by virtue of the diversity allowed by कृत्यलुटो बहुलं [[3.3.113]] ॥ Thus बिभेति अस्माद् = भय्यम् \"frightening or fearable\". The word प्रवय्या is always used in the feminine: in other places प्रवेय is the proper form. Why do we say 'in the Vedas'? Observe भेयम्, प्रवेयम् in secular literature.\n\nVart:- The word हृदय्या should also be enumerated when referring to water. As हृदे भवा = हृदय्या आपः ॥ The affix यत् is added by [[4.4.110]] (हृदे + य = हृदय् + य) ॥",
    "61084": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. In every <i>sutra</i> upto [[6.1.112]] (excluding the last), whatever we shall teach, there in the room of the two, namely, the preceding and the succeeding, it should be understood, that the substitution is one. These form the well known rules of <i>ekadesa</i>, one letter or form replacing two consecutive letters &c. Thus [[6.1.87]] teaches 'There is <i>guna</i> substitution, when अ or आ is followed by a vowel'. We must supply into that <i>sutra</i> the phrase एकः पूर्वपरयोः i. e. one <i>guna</i> is the substitute for the final अ or आ and the initial vowel. Thus खट्वा + इन्द्रः = खट्वेन्द्रः ॥ Here ए is the single substitute of the both preceding Ietter आ and the succeeding letter इ ॥ The words पूर्व पर show that the substitute operates simultaneously on both. Otherwise the substitute would have come in the place of one only or of each one separately. Thus in आद् गुणः (अचि) = \"after अ or आ, there is <i>guna</i>, in a vowel\". Here आत् is in this ablative, and by [[1.1.67]] the <i>guna</i> operation would have taken place on the letter following it: so also अचि is in the Locative and by [[1.1.66]], the <i>guna</i> operation would have taken place on the preceding; so it is not clear of what letter there should be <i>guna</i> substitution, of the preceding or the succeeding. But the present rule shows it must operate on both simultaneously. The word एक 'single', shows that a separate or a different substitute does not operate: i. e. the substitute must be one, there should not be two separate substitutes one for each <i>sthani</i>, such as we find in the <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.42]] (रदाभ्यां निष्ठातो नः, पूर्वस्य च दः \"न is the substitute of the त of <i>nishtha</i>, after र् and द, and of the preceding द\"). Here न् is taught as substitute both of त् and द्, and as एक is not used in the <i>sutra</i>, we get two न, as भिद् + त = भिन् + न = भिन्नः ॥ But this is not the case here. According to <i>Mahabhashya</i> the word एक is redundant.",
    "61085": "The single substitute taught in the last, is considered in the light of the final of the preceding form and the initial of the succeeding. An <i>adesa</i> is like the <i>sthani</i>, but in an <i>ekadesa</i>, the <i>sthani</i> is indeterminate, or rather the <i>sthani</i> is the collection or the sum of the preceding and the succeeding. Hence the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>. The sense of this <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i> is this: as the beginning and the end of a thing are both included in the thing itself, and therefore when the thing is mentioned, the beginning and the end are both taken; so is the case with this single substitute. Thus to the stem ब्रह्मबन्धु we add ऊ the feminine affix [[4.1.66]]; and now उ + ऊ = ऊ [[6.1.101]] i. e. ब्रह्मबन्धु + ऊ = ब्रह्मबन्धू ॥ Here ब्रह्मबन्धु is a Nominal-stem (प्रातिपदिक) and the affix ऊ is a non-<i>pratipadika</i>, and the single-substitute ऊ is considered as the final of the <i>pratipadika</i>. So that we can apply to the form ब्रह्मबन्धु the term <i>pratipadika</i> and by virtue of this designation we can add the case-endings to it by [[4.1.1]]. But for this rule, we could not have added the case-endings to it, because by virtue of the feminine affix ऊ the word would have rather ceased to be a <i>pratipadika</i> (I. I. 46), because this feminine affix ऊ is not included in [[4.1.1]]. Similarly for the final non-case-ending अ of वृक्ष and the case-ending औ, there comes a single substitute औ by [[6.1.88]], this <i>ekadesa</i> औ is considered both as a non-case affix and a case affix, that is, as the initial of the affix औ, and the final of वृक्ष and thus the word वृक्षौ gets the designation of <i>Pada</i> [[1.4.14]] as it ends in the सुप् affix औ ॥\n\nThis अन्तादिवद्भाव does not apply in rules relating to letters i. e. to rules depending for their application on letters. Thus खट्व + आ = खट्वा ॥ Here the <i>ekadesa</i> आ is as the final अ of खट्व, but not for the purposes of the application of the rule which says that the भिस् is changed to ऐस् after a nominal-stem ending in अ, so the Instrumental plural of खट्वा will not end in ऐः, but will be खट्वाभिः ॥ So also in जुहाव ॥ It is the Perfect 3rd person singular of ह्वे or ह्वा ( VI. 1. 45). By [[6.1.53]], the व् is changed to उ, and we have जुह्व्आ = जुह्उआ which by [[6.1.108]] becomes जुहु, the उ being the single substitute of उ and आ ॥ This single-substitute उ should not be considered as आ for the application of the rule [[7.1.34]] by which the Perfect affix णल् (अ) is changed in औ after roots ending in आ ॥ Similarly in अस्यै + अश्वः = अस्या अश्वः (the य् being elided by [[8.3.19]]). अस्यै is the Dative singular of इदम् in the Feminine with आ ॥ By [[7.3.114]] स्या is added in the Dative with the shortening of the preceding  आ; as अ + स्या + ए = अस्यै (Here ऐ is the single substitute for आ and ए ॥ Here for the application of [[6.1.109]] the single substitute ऐ should not be considered like ए ॥ The <i>sthani</i> of the single-substitute (<i>ekadesa</i>) is the sum of the preceding and the succeeding, both taken collectively is replaced by one, and not any one of them separately. For that which is replaced by another is called <i>sthani</i>: as when भू replaces अस् the whole form अस् is called <i>sthani</i>, and not अ or स् separately. The parts, may be called <i>sthani</i> only inferentially, because the whole is made up of parts. The parts not being considered as <i>sthani</i>, the rule of <i>sthanivad</i> <i>bhava</i> will not apply to an <i>ekadesa</i> with regards to the parts, and no operations dependant on such parts will be effected by such <i>ekadesa</i>. But it is intended that such operations should take place. Hence this <i>sutra</i>.",
    "61086": "The word असिद्ध means not-accomplished i. e. the operation caused by its having taken effect is not produced. The word <i>asiddha</i> always debars operations dependent upon this <i>adesa</i>, and gives scope to the operations dependent upon the general rule ( असिद्धवचनमादेशलक्षणप्रतिषेदार्थमुत्संगलक्षणभावार्थं च ॥) Thus कांऽसिचत् here स is not changed to ष ॥ The equation is thus exhibited : कस् + असिचत् = कर् + असिचत् (the स changed to र by [[8.2.66]]) कंउ + असिचत् (उ being substituted for र by [[6.1.113]]) = को + असिचत् (अ + उ = ओ [[6.1.87]])  = कोऽसिचत् (ओ + अ = ओ [[6.1.109]]). Now applies our <i>sutra</i>. By [[8.3.59]], स coming after ओ required to be changed into ष, but here the single-substitute ओ is considered to be non-effective for this purpose. Similarly कोऽस्य, योऽस्य, कोऽस्मै, यौऽस्मै ॥ Similarly in अधीत्य there is the addition of त् by [[6.1.71]], though actually preceded by a long vowel. That long vowel had resulted from the <i>ekadesa</i> of ई for इ + इ, and this <i>ekadesa</i> is considered as if non-effective for the purposes of तुक् augment. Similarly in प्र + इ + तुक् + य = प्रेत्य.

I. I5) + शकहु (VI. I. 108). The Locative plural is formed by सु : शकहु + सु = शकहूषु (the lengthening taking place by [[6.4.2]]). Here स is changed to ष the <i>ekadesa</i> उ for उ + अ not being considered <i>asiddha</i>. So also परिवीषु (परि + ष्ये + क्विप् = परि + व्इए + क्विप् = परिवि, add सु)॥ Of the affix ङि we have:- वृक्ष + इ = वृक्षे, add छत्रम्, then the single substitute ए being considered not <i>asiddha</i> we have वृक्षेच्छत्रम् or वृक्षेछत्रम् ॥ Of the affix इट् of Ist Person <i>Atmanepada</i> we have अपचे + छत्रम् = अपचेच्छत्रम् or अपचेछत्रम् ॥  In both these cases we optionally add तुक् by (VI. I. 75) - (VI. I. 76), by considering the <i>ekadesa</i> [[6.1.87]] as to have taken effect, and making the finals दीर्घ or long. Here the <i>ekadesa</i> is not <i>asiddha</i> and therefore तुक् is optional and not compulsory.",

When the preceding vowel is not अ or आ, this rule does not apply. Thus the 3rd person plural of the Perfect of कृ is:- चकृ + उस् = चक्रुः ॥ So also from भी we have अबिभे + उस् = अबिभयुः ॥ The word अपदान्तात् 'not being final in a <i>pada</i>' does strictly speaking, serve no good purpose in this <i>sutra</i>. For the affix उस् can never be added to a <i>Pada</i>, it must always be added to a stem, that has not yet risen to the rank of a <i>Pada</i>. If उस्, however, be taken as the syllable उस् (whether an affix or part of an affix or not), then the limitation of अपदान्तात् becomes valid.

Now by adding क्विप् to the denominative root सखीय we get सखीः 'one who wishes for a friend'. The Ablative and Genitive Singular of this word will be सखी + अस् = सख्युः also. Of ती we have the following example. लूनमिच्छति = लूनीय, add क्विप् = लूनीः, the Ablative and Genitive singular of which is also लून्युः, the न् of लूनी being the substitute of त् of <i>Nishtha</i>, is considered like त् [[8.2.1]]. The peculiar exhibition of ख्य and त्य in the <i>sutra</i>, instead of saying directly सखिपतिभ्यां indicates that the rule does not apply to words like अतिसखि &c : where we have अतिसखेः, सेनापतेः ॥ The word अतिसखि is घि in spite of the prohibition (l. 4. 7), for that prohibition applies only to सखि and not to a compound which ends in it, on the maxim ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति ॥ \"That which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>Pratipadika</i> does (contrary to [[1.1.72]]) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself\". According to Dr. Ballantyne this rule applies to all खी and ती, such as सुखीः 'one who loves pleasure' (सुखमिच्छति = सुखीय + क्विप्). and सुतीः 'one who wishes a son' (सुतमिच्छति = सुतीय + क्विप्): Thus सुख्युः, सुत्युः &c.",

The prolation of vowels is taught in the <i>tripadi</i> or the last three chapters of <i>Ashtadhyayi</i>; and the <i>tripadi</i> are considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of previous <i>sutras</i> (VIII. 2. 1.). This is not the case here, otherwise the mention of <i>pluta</i> would be redundant. Of the Excepted or <i>Pragrihya</i> vowels the following are the examples : अग्नी इति, वायू इति, खट्वे इति, माले इति ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of अचि was current in this <i>sutra</i> from [[6.1.77]]: its repetition here is for the sake of ordaining प्रकृतिभाव ॥ That is, the <i>pluta</i> and the <i>pragrihya</i> retain their original forms when such a vowel follows which would have caused a substitution. Thus जानु उ अस्य, रुजति here in combining जानु + उ into जानू, the अ is no cause of lengthening, therefore, the lengthening will take place. Now since उ is a <i>pragrihya</i>, it follows that जानू which ends in उ is also a <i>pragrihya</i>, and therefore it should not be changed before  अ of अस्य ॥ Hence we have the form जानू + अस्य = जानू अस्य ॥ There may also be the form जान्वस्य, not by इकोयणचि, but by मय उञो वो वा [[8.3.33]]. In fact, the repetition of अचि in this <i>sutra</i> is necessary, in order to enable us to give this peculiar meaning to the <i>sutra</i>. Otherwise, had the <i>sutra</i> been simply प्लुतप्रगृह्याः, it would have been translated ordinarily thus: \"The <i>Pluta</i> and <i>Pragrihya</i> retain their form, when ever a vowel follows\". Therefore in जानु उ अस्य, since उ is followed by a vowel, it will retain its form, and will not coalesce with the उ of जानु ॥ But this is not intended. Hence the repetition of the word अचि, and the peculiar explanation given above, namely, <i>Pluta</i> and <i>Pragrihya</i> vowels retain their form before a vowel which would otherwise have caused a substitution, but it would not prevent the operation of any other rule. Therefore in जानु उ अस्य रुजति, the उ + उ will become lengthened, because अ is not the cause of lengthening; it causes the change of उ to व्, which of course is prevented. The word नित्य of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also.

By not using वत्, the whole <i>Pluta</i> itself would be changed into <i>Apluta</i>, and would give rise to the following incongruity. There is <i>prakriti</i> <i>bhava</i> in the case of <i>pluta</i> and <i>pragrihya</i>. A vowel which is <i>pluta</i> need not be <i>pragrihya</i>, nor a <i>pragrihya</i>, a <i>pluta</i>. But where a vowel is both a <i>pluta</i> and a <i>pragrihya</i> at one and the sametime, there will arise the difficulty. Thus in the dual अग्नी or वायू, the इ and ऊ are <i>pragrihya</i>. They may be made <i>pluta</i> also as अग्ना ३ or वायू ३ ॥ Now if before इति, the <i>pluta</i> became <i>apluta</i>, then we shall not hear the prolation at all in अग्नी इति वायू इति formed by अग्नी ३ + इति &c. For here the vowels will retain their form by being <i>pragrihya</i> by (VI. I. 125), and in addition to that they will lose their <i>pluta</i>, by the present rule. But this is not intended.

    "61135": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> and extends upto [[6.1.157]]. Whatever we shall teach hereafter, in all those, the phrase 'the augment सुट् is placed before the letter क्' should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus [[6.1.137]] teaches \"After सम्, परि and उप when followed by the verb कृ, the sense being that of adorning\". Here the above phrase should be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense, i. e. \"the augment स् is added before the क् of कृ when it is preceded by सम्, परि and उप, and the sense is that of adorning\". Thus सम् + स् + कृ + तृ = संस्कर्ता, संस्कर्तुम्, संस्कर्तव्यम् ॥ In the succeeding aphorisms it will be seen that the augment सुट् comes only before those roots which begin with क ॥ What is then the necessity of using the phrase कात्पूर्वः in this <i>sutra</i>? It is used to indicate that the स् remains unattached to क्, though it stands before it. Thus though कृ becomes स्कृ, yet the latter should not be considered to be a verb beginning with a conjunct (<i>sanyoga</i>) consonant:and therefore the <i>guna</i> taught in [[7.4.10]] (the root ending in ऋ and preceded by a conjunct letter, takes <i>guna</i> before लिट्) does not apply, nor do the rules like [[7.4.29]], nor the rules ordaining the addition of intermediate इट् [[7.2.43]] by which the इट् would come in लिङ् and सिच् (Imperfect and Aorist); as, संस्कृषीष्ट and समस्कृत; and so also [[7.4.29]], does not apply as संस्क्रियते the Passive Imperfect (यकि लिङि) of संस्कृ ॥ If so, then the <i>anudatta</i> accent taught in [[8.1.28]] would not take place, since the augment सुट् would intervene between the non-तिङ्-word सं and the तिङन्त word करोति, thus संस्करोति would have accent on the verb. It is a maxim स्वरविधौ व्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् 'in applying a rule relating to accent the intervening consonants are considered as if non-existent'; and therefore सुट् does not offer any intervention to the application of the rule [[8.1.28]]. If स् is not to be taken as attached to क, how do you explain the <i>guna</i> in the Perfect 3rd Person Dual and Plural in संचस्करतुः and संचस्करुः which apparently is done by applying [[7.4.10]]. Though that rule strictly applies to roots beginning with a conjunct consonant, it will apply also to roots like संस्कृ which have a conjunct consonant for their penultimate; and the <i>guna</i> is done also on the maxim तन्मध्यपतितस्तद् ग्रहणेन गृह्यते (See [[6.1.132]]).

It might be said where is the necessity then of this <i>sutra</i>? The operation relating to a <i>Dhatu</i> and <i>Upasarga</i> is <i>Antaranga</i>, i. e. a root is first joined with the <i>Upasarga</i>, and it undergoes other operations afterwards. Therefore, first the augment सुट् is added, and then the अट् and आभ्यास operations take place. Thus संस्कृ is the form to which अट् and अभ्यास operations are to be applied. Now, we have said in the foregoing aphorism, that सुट् is considered as unattached to क; and therefore, the augment अट् may be added after this सुट्, and so also the reduplication may take place without it. Thus we may have the forms like संस्करोत् and संस्चकार ॥ But this is not desired, hence the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> teaching that even after अट् and reduplicate, the सुट् must be placed before क and no where else.",

I. 137) - [[6.1.139]] we have उपकरोति ॥",
    "61140": "Thus उपस्कारं मद्रका लुनन्ति, उपस्कारं काश्नीरका लुनन्ति = विक्षिप्य लुनन्ति ॥\n\nVart:- The above augment takes place when णमुल् is added to the verb उप-कृ, as shown in the above examples. When the meaning is not that of 'to cut', the form is उपकिरति ॥",
    "61141": "Thus उपस्कीर्णम् or प्रतिस्कीर्णं हन्त ते वृषल भूयात् = तथा ते वृषल विक्षपो भूयाद् यथा हिंसामनुबध्नाति ॥\n\nWhy do we say when 'the sense is to cause pain'? Observe प्रतिकीर्णम् ॥",
    "61142": "Thus अपस्किरते वृषभो हृष्टः, अपस्किरते कुक्कुटो भक्ष्यार्थी; अपस्किरते श्वा आश्रयार्थी = आलिख्य विक्षिपति ॥ Why do we say 'four-footed animals or birds'? Observe अपकिरति देवदत्तः ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies when the scraping is through pleasure, or for the sake of finding food, or making a resting place. Therefore not here:- अपकिरति श्वा ओदनपिण्डमाशितः ॥ And it is in the above senses of scraping through pleasure &c, that the root takes <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes; otherwise the <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes will follow. See [[1.3.21]]. <i>Vartika</i>",
    "61143": "The कुस्तुम्बुरु is the name of coriander - i. e. धान्यकं; the seeds are also so called. The exhibition of the word in the <i>sutra</i> in the Neuter gender does not however show that the word is always Neuter. When not meaning coriander, the form is कुतुम्बुरु (कुत्सितानि तुम्बुरूणि) ॥ The word तुम्बुरु here means the fruit of the ebony tree.",
    "61144": "<i>Karika</i>\n\nलुम्पेदवश्यमः कृत्ये तुंकाममनसोरपि ।\nसमो वा हितततयोर्मांसस्य पचियुड्घञोः ॥\"\n\nThus अपरस्पराः सार्था गच्छन्ति = सन्ततमविच्छेदेन गच्छन्ति ॥ When the continuity of action is not meant, we have अपरपराः सार्था गच्छन्ति = अपरे परेच सकृदेव गच्छन्ति ॥ The सातत्य comes from सततं, by adding ष्यञ् to form the abstract noun, सततस्य भावः (V. I. 123) = सातत्यं ॥ How do you explain सततम्, it ought to be सन्ततम् ? The म् of सम् is optionally elided before ततं, on the strength of the <i>Karika</i>:-\"The म् of अवश्यम् is elided before a word ending in a <i>kritya</i> affix, the म् of तुम् is elided before काम and मनस्, the म् of सम् is elided optionally before हित and तत, the final अ of मांस is elided before पाक or पचन ॥ As (1) अवश्य कर्तव्यं = अवश्यकर्तव्यं, (2) भोक्तुम् कामः = भोक्तुम् कामः, श्रोतुमनः ॥ (3) सम्हितं = सहितं, सम् ततं = सततं ॥ (4) मांस् पाकः, मांस् पचनम् ॥",
    "61145": "Thus गोष्पदो देशः = गावः पद्यन्ते यस्मिन् देशे स गोभिः सेवितो देशः ॥ So also अगोष्पदान्यरण्यानि ॥ The word गोष्पद by itself does not mean 'not visited by cows'. Therefore the negative particle is added to give that sense. So also गोष्पदमात्रं क्षेत्रं, गोष्पदपूरं वृष्टो देवः ॥ Here the word has no reference to cow, but to the quantity of land and rain. When it has not the above senses, the form is गोपदम् = गोः पदम् ॥ What is the use of the word असेवित in the <i>sutra</i>, the word गोष्पद will give अगोष्पद by adding the negative particle, न गोष्पद = अगोष्पद? The force of नञ् compound is that of सदृश \"like that but not that\". As अब्राह्मण means \"a man who is a <i>Kshatriya</i> &c. not a <i>Brahmana</i>, but does not mean a stone &c\". Therefore अगोष्पद with नञ् would mean \"a place like a pasture land but in which cows do not graze, but in which there is a possibility of cows grazing\". But it is intended that it should refer to a place where there is no such possibility, hence असेवित is used. Therefore, deep forests where cows can never enter, are called अगोष्पद ॥",
    "61146": "The word प्रतिष्ठा means 'firm place, established position, rank, dignity, authority'. Thus आस्पदम् अनेन लब्धम् ॥ Why do we say when 'meaning a place'? Observe आ पदात् = आपदम् ॥",
    "61147": "The word आश्चर्य is formed by adding the affix यत् to the verb चर् with the preposition आ, and the augment सुट् ॥ Thus आश्चर्यं यदि स भुंजीत, आश्चर्यं यदि सोऽधीयीत ॥ When not having this sense, we have आश्चर्यं कर्म शोभनम् ॥",
    "61148": "That which has bad lustre is called वचस्क (कुत्सितं) ॥ It applies to the ejected food. To the root कृ is added the affix अप् [[3.3.57]], the preposition अव and irregularly the सुट् ॥ Thus अवस्करोऽन्नमलम् ॥ The place where the excreta lie (the rectum) is also so called. When not having this sense, we have अवकरः ॥",
    "61149": "This word is also derived from कृ with the proposition अप and the affix अप् [[3.3.57]] and सुट् augment. When not having this meaning, we have अपकरः ॥",
    "61150": "<i>Verse</i>\n\nसर्वे शकुनयो भक्ष्या विष्किराः कुक्कुटादृते ।\n\nThis word is formed by adding the affix क (III. I. 135) to कृ with the preposition वि and the augment सुट् ॥ The word विकिर also refers to birds only, a kind of cock. The phrase शकुनिर्विकिरा वा is added from the <i>Vartika</i> and is no part of the original <i>sutra</i>. Thus सर्वे शकुनयो भक्ष्या विष्किराः कुक्कुटादृत ॥ Though the <i>sutra</i> विष्किरोवाशकुनौ would have given the optional form विकिर, the specific mention of this form in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that विकिर always means 'bird' and nothing else. Otherwise विकिर would have referred to some thing other than a bird.",
    "61151": "Thus सुश्चन्द्रो युष्मान् ॥ Why do we say after a short vowel? Observe सूर्याचन्द्रमसाविव ॥ Why do we say 'in a <i>Mantra</i>'? Observe, सुचन्द्रा पौर्णमासी ॥ The उत्तरपद can only be in a compound (<i>samasa</i>) as it is well-known to all and it does not mean, 'the second word', as the literal meaning might convey : Therefore the rule does not apply here शुक्रमसि चन्द्रमसि ॥",
    "61152": "<i>Verse</i>\n\nग्राममद्य प्रवेक्ष्यामि भव मे त्वं प्रतिष्कशः ।\n\nThe word प्रतिष्कश is formed by adding अच् affix [[3.1.134]] to the root, with adding the prefix प्रति ॥ Thus ग्राममद्य प्रवेक्ष्यामि भव मे त्वं प्रतिष्कशः 'I shall inspect the town to-day, be thou my emissary'. The word प्रतिष्कशः means \"a messenger, a herald, an emissary\". Why do we say \"to the root कश\"? Observe प्रतिगतः कशां = प्रतिकशोऽश्वः 'a horse guided by the whip'. Here though कशा is derived from कश, yet the augment does not take place, because the augment comes to the root कश्, and not to a derivative word.",
    "61153": "Thus प्रस्कण्व ऋषिः, हरिश्चन्द्र ऋषिः ॥ The word हरिश्चन्द्र could be formed by [[6.1.151]] in the <i>Mantra</i>, here it refers to other than <i>Mantras</i>. When not referring to <i>Rishis</i>, we have प्रकण्वो देशः, (कण्वं पापं तत्प्रगतं यस्मात्) हरिश्चन्द्रो मानवकः (हरिः चन्द्रो यस्य मुग्धस्य)॥",
    "61154": "When not having these meanings, the form is मकरः ॥ This is an underived nominal stem, having no derivation, to which सुट् is added when 'a bamboo' is meant; and the affix इनि in addition, when a mendicant is to be expressed and thus we have मस्कर and मस्करिन् ॥ Why do we say \"when meaning a bamboo or a mendicant\". Observe मकरोग्राहः \"an alligator\", मकरा समुद्र \"an ocean\". Some say the word मकर is a derivative word, being derived from कृ 'to do' with the negative particle मा and the affix अच्, the long आ being shortened. Thus मा क्रियते येन प्रतिषिध्यते = मस्करः 'a bamboo or stick by which the prohibition is made'. So also by adding that इनि in the sense of ताच्छील्य to the root कृ preceded by the <i>upapada</i> मा; we get मस्करिन् ॥ Thus मा करणशाला = मस्करी \"a monk, who has renounced all works\". A mendicant always says \"मा कुरुतः कर्माणि शान्तिर्वः श्रेयसी\" - \"Do no works ye men, for peace is your highest end\".",
    "61155": "When not meaning cities, we have कातीरम् (ईषत् तीरमस्य); and अजतुन्दम् (अजस्येव तुन्दमस्य) ॥",
    "61156": "This word is formed from कार + कृ + ट [[3.2.21]] = कारस्करः ॥ When not meaning a tree, the form is कारकरः ॥ Some do not make this a separate <i>sutra</i>, but include it in the next aphorism.",
    "61157": "These words are irregularly formed by adding सुट् ॥ Thus पारस्करः 'a country called <i>Paraskara</i>'. कारस्करः 'Name of a tree', रथस्या 'Name of a river', किष्कुः 'Name of a measure', किष्किन्धा 'Name of a cave', तस्कर 'a thief', formed by inserting सुट् in the compound of तत् + कर, and eliding त् ॥ बृहस्पति 'Name of a Diety', formed similarly by inserting सुट् between बृहत् + पति and eliding the त् ॥ Why do we say when meaning a thief and a diety? Observe तत्करः, बृहत्पतिः ॥ The words चोर and देवता are used in the <i>Ganapatha</i> merely for the sake of diversity, the word संज्ञा would have connoted that प्रस्तुम्पति गौः ॥ When the root तुप तुम्प 'to injure' is preceded by the preposition प्र, there is added सुट् to प्र, when the agent of the verb is a cow. Why do we say 'when the agent is cow'? Observe प्रतुम्पति वनस्पतिः ॥ In प्रस्तुम्पति the सुट् is added to a finite verb, which is thus conjugated:- प्रस्तुम्पति गौः, प्रस्तुम्पती गावौ, प्रस्तुम्पन्ति गावः ॥ This is an <i>akritigana</i>. Thus प्रायश्चित्तम्, प्रायश्चित्तिः ॥\n\n1 पारस्करो देशः, 2 कारस्करो वृक्षः, 3 रथस्या नदी, 4 किष्कुः प्रमाणम्, 5 किष्किन्धा गुहा, 6 तद्बृहतोः करपत्योश्चोरदेवतयोः सुट् तलापश्च (तस्करः चोरः, बृहस्पतिः = देवता), 7 प्रात् तुम्पतौ गवि कर्तरि (प्रस्तुम्पति गौः) ॥ आकृतिगणः ॥",
    "61158": "<i>Karika</i>\n\nआगमस्य विकारस्य प्रकृतेः प्रत्ययस्य च ।\nपृथक्स्वरनिवृत्त्यर्थमेकवर्जं पदस्वरः ॥\n\nThat is, only one syllable in a word is accented, all the rest are <i>anudatta</i> or unaccented. This is a <i>Paribhasha</i> or maxim of interpretation with regard to the laws of accent. Wherever an accent-be it acute (<i>udatta</i>) or a circumflex (<i>svarita</i>) is ordained with regard to a word, there this maxim must be applied, to make all the other syllables of that word unaccented. The word अनुदात्त means 'having an <i>anudatta</i> vowel'. What is the one to be excepted? That one about which any particular accent has been taught in the rules here-in-after given. Thus (VI. I. 162) teaches that a root has acute accent on the final. Therefore, with the exception of the last syllable, all the other syllables are unaccented. Thus in गोपाय꣡ति the acute accent is on य, all the rest are unaccented. The root accent is superseded by आ accent, thus लुना꣡ति has acute accent on ना ॥ The  आ accent is superseded by तस् accent, as लुनीतः꣡, has accent on तः ॥ The तस् accent is superseded by आम् accent, as लुनीतस्तरा꣡म् ॥\n\nआगमस्य विकारस्य प्रकृतेः प्रत्ययस्य च, पृथक् स्वरनिवृत्यर्थमेकवर्जं पदस्वरः ॥ The words 'with the exception of one syllable' show that the separate accent of an augment, or a preparative element, or a stem or an affix should cease, when a particular accent is taught for a word'. Thus as to (1) augment:-[[7.1.98]] teaches \"आम् acutely accented is the augment of चतुर् and अनडुह् when a <i>sarvanamasthana</i> affix follows\". Thus चत्वा꣡रः, अनड्वा꣡हः, here the augment-accent supersedes the accent of the stem, for च꣡तुर was acutely accented on the first syllable, so also अनडु꣡ह्, these being formed by the affixes उरन् and असुन् respectively. Thus चत् + उरन् = च꣡तुर (चतेरुरन् <i>Un</i> V. 58, accent [[6.1.197]]); अनडुह् is thus derived : अनो वहति = अनस् + वह् + क्विप्, the स् is replaced by ड्, and there is vocalisation of व् of वह् (VI. I. 15) = अनडु꣡ह् ॥ This word is formed by a <i>Krit</i> affix with a <i>karaka</i> <i>upapada</i>, therefore, the second term will retain its original accent, namely the final acute of a root. [[6.1.162]] and [[6.2.139]] अनस् itself is derived by adding the affix (<i>Un</i> IV. 189) असुन् which makes the word acutely accented on the first syllable. (2). Similarly as to विकार (<i>Vikarana</i>):- [[7.1.75]] teaches \"instead of अस्थि, दधि, सक्थि, and अक्षि, there shall be आनङ् acutely accented when टा follows or any of the subsequent terminations beginning with a vowel\". This अन will supersede the acute accent of the first अ of the stem: as अस्थ꣡नि ॥ The word अ꣡स्थि is derived from अस् by adding the affix क्थिन् (<i>Un</i> III. 154) which makes the word acutely accented on the first [[6.1.197]]. This is an example of विकार ॥ (3) Similarly in गोपायति the accent of the stem taught in [[6.1.162]] 'a root has an accent on its final', supersedes the accent of the <i>vikarana</i> आय [[3.1.28]], [[3.1.3]], i. e. the acute accent on आ in आय gives way to the root-accent which makes य acute. (4) So also the accent of the affix supersedes that of the stem : as कर्त्तव्य॑म्, and हर्तव्य॑म्, which are formed by the affix तव्यत् [[3.1.96]] here [[6.1.185]] debars the accent of the root [[6.1.162]].\n\nThe determination of the proper accent of a word depends upon considering the various rules that have gone to form it, and the sequence of those rules, e. g. a latter rule (पर) superseding a prior rule, a <i>nitya</i> rule superseding an <i>anitya</i> rule, an <i>antaranga</i> superseding a <i>bahiranga</i>, an <i>apavada</i> rule superseding an <i>utsarga</i> rule. But another test is, what is the remaining rule that applies after giving scope to all. A rule, that in spite of another rule, finds scope or activity, bars that former rule. Thus गोपायति ॥ It is derived from गु꣡प् root, which as a root has accent on the syllable गु [[6.1.162]]. When the affix आय is added to it by [[3.1.28]], the word becomes गोपा꣡य and it takes the accent of the affix [[3.1.3]], i. e. the accent now falls on पा; but now comes rule [[3.1.32]] which says that a word taking the affix आय is a root. Thus गोपाय꣡ gets the designation of root (धातु), and thus takes the accent of a <i>dhatu</i> [[6.1.162]], and the accent falls on य ॥\n\nThe rule is that except one special accent taught in a <i>sutra</i> the other syllables take <i>anudatta</i>. Therefore, where there is a conflict of rules, the accent is guided by the follwing maxim: \"परनित्यान्तरङ्गापवादैः स्वरैर्व्यवस्था सति प्रकृतिशिष्ठेन च\" namely (1) the sequence, a succeeding rule setting aside a prior rule (2) a <i>Nitya</i> rule is stronger then <i>Anitya</i>, (3) <i>Antaranga</i> stronger than <i>Bahiranga</i>, ( 4 ) the <i>Apavada</i> is stronger then <i>Utsarga</i>. When all these are exhausted, as we have illustrated above, then we apply the rule of सतिशिष्ठ ॥ What is this rule? To quote the words of <i>Kasika</i>: यो हि यस्मिन् सति शिष्यते स तस्य बाधको भवति \"that which does remain and must last in spite of the presence of another, debars such other\". Thus in गोपायति; here the प्रत्ययस्वरः \"the accent of the affix\" [[3.1.3]] by which the acute is on the first syllable of the affix is an <i>apavada</i> to the धातुस्वरः [[6.1.192]] by which the final of a <i>dhatu</i> is acute, and it debars the <i>dhatu</i>-accent; but this affix-accent is in its turn debarred in the case of derivative verbs formed with affixes, by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ, because even after the addition of the affix, these words retain the designation of <i>dhatu</i>. Similarly in कार्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गपुत्रः, \"The son of him whose upper garment (<i>uttarasanga</i>) is of black color--the Son of <i>Baladeva</i>\" the <i>Bahuvrihi</i>-accent [[6.2.1]] being an <i>apavada</i> to <i>Samasa</i>-accent [[6.1.223]], debars the <i>samasa</i>-accent; but this <i>Bahuvrihi</i>-accent is in its turn debarred by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ when a further compound is formed and the final word is a compound only and not a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. Though the accent of the <i>Vikarana</i> is a सतिशिष्ठ, yet it does not debar the <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> accent [[6.1.186]]. Thus in लुनीतः, the accent of the <i>vikarana</i> नी does not debar the accent of तस् ॥\n\nVart:- The नञ् accent is stronger than the case-affix accent. Thus in अतिस्रः, here the accent of जस् <i>vibhakti</i> after तिसृ [[6.1.166]] though सतिशिष्ठ is debarred by नञ् accent taught in [[6.2.2]], for Negative compounds are <i>Tatpurusha</i>.\n\nVart:- The accent of नञ् is stronger than the accent of that which is caused or occasioned by a <i>vibhakti</i>. Thus अचत्वारः ॥  Here the augment आम् in चत्वार is occasioned because of the case-affix, for it is added only then when a <i>Sarvanama</i> case-affix follows [[7.1.98]]. This आ is <i>udatta</i> [[6.1.98]]. But this <i>udatta</i> is superseded by the accent of the Negative particle.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the body of a <i>pada</i>'? In a sentence, every word will retain its accent. As देव꣡दत्त ! गा꣡मभ्याज शुक्ला꣡म् \"<i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i>, drive away the white cow\". The word पद is in fact used in this <i>sutra</i> in its secondary sense, namely that which will get the designation of पद when completed; had it meant the full ready made <i>pada</i>, this word would not have been repeated in पदाधिकार <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.16]], [[8.1.17]]. Had a full '<i>pada</i>' been meant, the incongruity would arise in the following. The word कु꣡वल is acutely accented on the first as belonging to ग्रामादि class (<i>Phit</i> II. 15), adding the feminine affix ङीष् to it by its belonging to ग्रामादि class, we get कुवली, which will retain its acute on the first because it is not technically a पद ॥ But it is not so, the word कुवली has <i>anudatta</i> accent on the first syllable (<i>Phit</i> II. 15), and hence we can apply the अञ् affix to it by [[4.2.44]], thus कुवल्या विकारः = कौवलम् ॥ Similarly the word गर्भिणी formed from ग꣡र्भ (belonging to <i>Gramadi</i> class <i>Phit</i> II. 15), with, the affix इनि [[5.2.115]] and the feminine ङीप् ॥ If here the affix इनि being <i>udatta</i> causes all the rest syllables <i>anudatta</i>, just at the very moment of its application, without seeing whether the word was a <i>pada</i> or not, then the word गर्भिणी being <i>anudattadi</i> would have taken अञ्, and therefore its exception is proper in the भिक्षादि class [[4.2.38]]. But if the <i>anudatta</i>-hood of the remaining syllables were to follow after a word had got the designation of पद, then the word गर्भिणी would remain acutely accented on the first, and its enumeration in [[4.2.38]] would be useless.",
    "61159": "Thus कर्षः꣡, पाकः꣡, त्यागः꣡, रागः꣡, दायः꣡, धायः꣡ ॥ This is an exception to [[6.1.197]] by which affixes having an indicatory ञ् have acute accent on the first syllable. The word कर्ष is used in the aphorism instead of कृष्, to indicate that कृष of <i>Bhvadi</i> <i>gana</i> is affected by this rule, and not कृष् — कृषति of <i>Tudadigana</i>. The word क꣡र्षः derived from <i>Tudadi</i> कृष् has acute accent on the first syllable.",
    "61160": "Thus 1. उञ्छः꣡, 2. म्लेच्छः꣡, 3. जञ्जः꣡, 4. जल्पः꣡ ॥ These are formed by घञ्, and would have taken acute-accent on the first. 5. जपः꣡, 6. वधः꣡ are formed by अप् affix [[3.3.61]] which being grave [[3.1.4]], these words would have taken the accent of the <i>dhatu</i> [[6.1.162]], i. e. acute on the first syllable. Some read व्यधः꣡ also here. 7. युगः꣡ is derived from युज् by घञ् affix, the non-causing of <i>guna</i> is irregular, and the word means 'a cycle of time', 'a part of a carriage'. In other senses, the form is योगः꣡ ॥ 8. गरः꣡ = (दूष्ये); is formed by अप्, and has this accent when it means 'poison', in other senses, the acute is on the first syllable. 9. वेगः꣡, वेदः꣡, वेष्टः꣡ (चेष्टः), and बन्धः꣡, करणे ॥ These words are formed by घञ् by [[3.3.121]]. When denoting instrument (करण) they take the above accent, when denoting भाव the accent falls on the first syllable. 10. स्तुयुद्रुवश्छन्दसि, e.g. परिष्टु꣡त्, परिद्रु꣡त्, संयु꣡त् ॥ 11. वर्त्तनिः स्तोत्रे, the <i>stotra</i> means <i>Sama</i> <i>Veda</i>, the word व॒॒र्त्त॒॒निः꣡ occurring in the <i>Sama</i> <i>Veda</i> has acute on the last : in other places, it has the accent on the middle. 12. श्वभ्रे दरः, the दरः꣡ has end-acute when meaning 'a cave', otherwise when formed by अप् affix it has acute on the first. 13. साम्बतापौ भावगर्हायाम्, thus सा॒॒म्बः꣡, ता॒॒पः꣡, in other senses, the acute is on the first. 14. उत्तमशश्वत्तमौ सर्वत्र, e.g. उ॒॒त्त॒॒मः꣡, श॒॒श्व॒॒त्त॒॒मः꣡ ॥  Some read the limitation of भावगर्हा into this also. 15. भक्षमन्थभोगमन्थाः (भोगदेहा) ॥ These are formed by घञ्, भक्ष though a ण्यन्त root is here घञन्तं ॥ \n\n1 उञ्छ, 2 म्लेच्छ, 3 जञ्ज, 4 जल्प, 5 जप, 6 वध (व्यध), 7 युग, 8 गरो दूष्ये, 9 वेदवेगवेष्टबन्धाः, (चेष्ट वेष्ट) करणे, 10 स्तुयुद्रुवश्छन्दसि (परिष्टुत्, संयुत्, परिद्रुत्), 11 वर्तनिः स्तोत्रे 12 श्वभ्रे दरः, 13 साम्बतापौ भावगर्हायाम्, 14 उत्तमशश्वत्तमौ (उत्तमशश्वत्तमशब्दौ) सर्वत्र, 15 भक्षमन्थः,  भोगमन्थाः (भक्षमन्थभोगदेहाः) ॥",
    "61161": "The word <i>udatta</i> is understood here. Thus कुमार꣡ + ई॒॒ = कुमा॒॒री꣡ ॥ The word कुमार has acute on the last, when the unaccented (<i>anudatta</i>) ङीप् is added to it, the अ꣡ is elided [[6.1.148]], the <i>anudatta</i> ई॒॒ becomes <i>udatta</i>. So also प॒॒थिन्꣡ + श॒॒स् = प॒॒थः꣡ [[7.1.88]], प॒॒थिन् + ए॒॒ = प॒॒थे, प॒॒थिन् + आ॒॒ = प॒॒था꣡ ॥ The पथिन् has acute on the last. So also कुमुद + ड्मतुप् = कुमुद्वा꣡न् [[4.2.87]], न॒॒ड्व꣡त्, वे॒॒तस्वत् ॥ The words कुमुद &c, are end-acute, and the affix मत् (वत्) is <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]].\n\nWhy 'an <i>anudatta</i> vowel gets &c'. Observe प्रा॒॒सङ्गः + य॑त् = प्रासङ्ग्यः ॥ (प्रासङ्गं वहति [[4.4.76]]). Here though प्रसङ्ग꣡ is end-acute [[6.2.144]] formed by घञ् with _<i>gati</i>)) it is followed by य॑ which is <i>svarita</i> [[6.1.185]], this <i>svarita</i> causes the <i>lopa</i> of अ꣡ <i>udatta</i>: but it does not itself become <i>udatta</i>. No, this is not a proper counter-example. For by the general rule of accent [[6.1.158]], when one syllable is ordained to be <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i>, all the other syllables of that word become <i>anudatta</i>. Therefore when य॑ is taught to be <i>svarita</i>, all the other syllables (like ङ्ग꣡) will become <i>anudatta</i>. So there is no <i>lopa</i> of <i>udatta</i> when य॑ comes. The word अनुदात्त is used to indicate that the initial <i>anudatta</i> becomes <i>udatta</i>. Had <i>anudatta</i> not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have been यत्रोदात्तलोपश्च, which would mean यस्मिन् प्रत्यये परत; उदात्तालुप्यते तस्यान्त उदात्तो भवति, for the <i>anuvritti</i> of अन्त would then be read from the last. There would then be anomaly in the case of मा हि धुक्षाताम्, and माहि धुक्षाथाम् ॥ From the root दुह we have formed धुक्षाताम् and धुक्षाथाम् in the Aorist Atmanepada<i>, dual. दुह् + क्स꣡ + आताम् = दुह् + स् [[7.3.72]] + आताम् ॥ Here आताम् causes the elision of the </i>udatta<i> अ of स ॥ Therefore the final of आता꣡म् would be </i>udatta<i>, which is not desired. The augment अ is not added because of मा, had it been added, the अ꣡ would have been </i>udatta<i> [[6.4.71]]. Had हि not been given, then also the whole of धुक्षाताम् would have become </i>anudatta<i> in माधुक्षाताम् because of तिङ्ङतिङः [[8.1.28]]. See [[8.1.34]] (हि च). Why have we used the word यत्र in the </i>sutra<i>? If it was not employed, then the subsequent </i>anudatta<i> may be such which would not have caused the elision of the previous </i>udatta<i>; such </i>udatta<i> being elided by some other operator, and still such </i>anudatta<i> would have become </i>udatta<i>. Thus in भार्गवः, भार्गवौ, भृगवः ॥ Here भृगवः is plural of भार्गवः ॥ The word भार्गव is end-acute and this acute (अण्) was elided in the plural, before the affix जस् was added. The elision here is not caused by जस्, but is a subject of जस् (not निमित्त but विषय). Therefore जस् does not become </i>udatta<i>, which would have been the case, had यत्र not been used. प्राक् सुबुत्पत्ते गोत्रप्रत्ययस्य लुक् ॥ The </i>gotra<i> affix was elided prior to the adding of the case-ending. Why do we say \"when an </i>udatta<i> is elided\"? Observe बिद + अञ् [[4.1.104]] = ब꣡द ॥ The feminine of this will be बैद꣡ + ङीन् [[4.1.73]] = बैदी꣡ ॥ Here ई causes the elision of </i>anudatta_ अ of द, and hence remains unchanged. So also आ꣡ र्वी ॥",
    "61162": "The word अन्त is understood here. Thus प꣡चति, प꣡ठति, ऊर्णो꣡ति, गोपाय꣡ति, या꣡ति ॥",
    "61163": "Thus भंगुर꣡म्, भासुर꣡म्, मेदुर꣡म्. These are formed by घुरच् [[3.2.161]]. So also कुण्डिनाः by [[2.4.70]] where the substitute कुण्डिनच् is employed. To कुण्ड is added इनि in the sense of मतुप्, then is added the feminine affix ङीप्, thus कुण्डि꣡नी has middle-acute. The descendants of <i>Kundini</i> will be काण्डिन्यः (by यञ् of <i>Gargadi</i>). The plural of <i>Kaundinya</i> will be formed by eliding यञ् and substituting कुण्डिनच for the remaining portion. In the cases of affixes having an indicatory च, the acute accent falls on the final, taking the stem and the affix in an aggregate. Thus बहुपटुः꣡ ॥ The affix बहुच् is one of those few affixes which are really prefixes. [[5.3.68]], The accent will not, therefore, fall on हु, but on the last syllable of the whole word compounded of the prefix + the base. So also with the affix अकच्. It is added in the middle of the word, but the accent will fall on the end; as उच्चैकः꣡ [[5.3.71]].",
    "61164": "Thus काञ्जायनाः꣡ formed by the affix च्फञ् [[4.1.98]]. कुञ्ज + च् फञ् + ञ्य = कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यः dual कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यौ, plural कौञ्जायनाः꣡ (ञ्य being elided by [[2.4.62]], and thus giving scope to च्फञ् accent). In this affix there are two indicatory letters च and ञ; the च has only one function, namely, regulating the accent according to this rule, while ञ has two functions, one to regulate accent by [[6.1.197]], and another to cause <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.117]]. Now arises the question, should the word get the accent च or of ञ ॥ The present rule declares that it should get the accent of च and not of ञ, for the latter finds still a function left to it, while if ञ was to regulate the accent, च would have no scope.",

There are singular or dual cases of this numeral; of the seven plural cases, the accusative plural will have acute on the final by [[6.1.174]]; the remaining cases (Instrumental, Dative, Ablative, Genitive and Locative) have affixes beginning with a consonant, and by [[6.1.179]] they will be <i>udatta</i>. Thus the only case not covered by any special rule is जस् (nominative plural); which would have been <i>Svarita</i>, but for this rule. If जस् be the only case not provided for, then merely saying तिसृभ्यः would have sufficed to make the rule applicable to जस् only, why has then it been employed in the <i>sutra</i>? This is done, in order that in compounds, where तिसृ may come as a subordinate member, and where singular and dual endings will also be added, this rule will not apply. Had जस् been not used in this <i>sutra</i>, then in the case of simple तिसृ there would be no harm, but when it is second member in a compound there would be anomaly. Thus अतितिस्रौ would have become end-acute. But that is not desired. It is <i>svarita</i> on the final by [[8.2.4]].",

This is so, because चतुर् has acute on the first, as formed by उरन् affix. Its substitute चतसृ will also be so, by the rule of स्थानिवत् ॥ The special enunciation of आद्युदात्त with regard to चतसृ in the <i>Vartika</i> चतसर्याद्युदात्तनिपातनं कर्तव्यं [[7.2.99]] indicates that the present rule does not apply to चतसृ ॥ Another reason for this is as follows: चतसृ + शस् = चतसृ + शस् ॥ Now comes the present <i>Sutra</i>; here, however, the र् substitute of ऋ being <i>sthanivat</i>, will prevent the <i>udatta</i> formation of the अ of त; nor will ऋ be considered as final and take the acute, as there exists no vowels ऋ but a consonant र् which cannot take an accent. As चतस्रः पश्य ॥ Professor Bohtlingk places the accent thus चतुरः꣡, Professor Max Muller चतु꣡रः ॥ I have followed Professor Max Muller in interpreting this <i>sutra</i>; for Bohtlingk's interpretation would make the ending शस् accented, and not the final of चतुर् ॥",

According to [[6.1.223]], the compounds have acute accent on the final: that rule applies in the alternative when the case-affixes are not acute and gives us\nthe alternative forms. Why do we say 'is acutely accented on the final'? Observe अ꣡वाचा, सु꣡वाचा, सु꣡त्वचा ॥ These are <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds and by [[6.2.2]]. the first term of the compound retains its original accent. Why have we used the word 'standing at the end of a compound' when the word नित्यसमासे indicated that the compound was meant ? Had we not used the word उत्तरपदात्, the aphorism would have stood as, अन्तोदात्तादन्यतरस्यामनित्यसमासे 'In a loose-compound having acute on the final, the above affixes are acute, if the compound consists of a monosyllable'. The word एकाचः will thus qualify the compound and not the second member of the compound, which is intended. And thus the rule will apply to श्वोर्क् (शुन ऊर्क्) Instrumental श्वोर्जा, श्वोर्जेः &c, and not to compounds having more than one syllable. Why do we say 'in loose compounds'? Observe अग्नि॒॒चि꣡ता, सो॒॒मसु꣡ता ॥ These words form invariable (<i>nitya</i>) compounds by [[2.2.19]], and by [[6.2.139]], the second member retains its original accent, which makes चि <i>udatta</i>.",

This rule debars it. The use of दीर्घात् indicates that the word अष्टन् has two forms, and the substitution of long अ taught in [[7.2.84]], thus becomes optional, because of this indication. Otherwise the employment of the word दीर्घात् would be useless, for by [[7.2.84]] which is couched in general terms, अष्टन् would always end in a long vowel. There is another use of the word दीर्घात्, namely, it makes the word अष्टान् with long आ [[7.2.84]] to get also the designation of षट् ॥ For if अष्टान् was not to be called a षट्, like अष्टन्, then there would be scope to the present <i>sutra</i> in the case of अष्टान् while it would be debarred in the case of अष्टन् without long आ, by the subsequent rule (VI.

In the first case मुक् becomes part and parcel of अ and will be taken and included by the enunciation of अ, and therefore अदुपदेश will mean and include an अ having such मुक्, as on the maxim यदागमास्तद्गुणीभूतास्तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यन्ते \"That to which an augment is added denotes, because the augment forms part of it, not merely itself, but it denotes also whatever results from its combination with that augment\". Therefore मुक् will not prevent the verb becoming अदुपदेश ॥ But if secondly मुक् be taken as part of the base which ends in अ, then the लसार्वधातुक does not follow an अदुपदेश, because म intervenes. But we get rid of this difficulty by considering मुक् augment as <i>Bahiranga</i> and therefore <i>asiddha</i>, when the <i>Antaranga</i> operation of accent is to be performed.

Therefore though श्नु is considered as ङित् for the purposes of preventing the <i>guna</i> of the prior term चि, it will not be considered so for the purposes of subsequent accent. Or the word ङित् in this <i>sutra</i> may be taken as equal to ङिदुपदेश and not the आतिदेशिक ङित् like श्नु ॥ Why do we use the word <i>upadesa</i> ? So that the rule may apply to प꣡चावः, प꣡चामः, but not to हतः, हथः the dual of हन् which ends in न् in <i>upadesa</i>. though before तस् and थस् it has assumed the form ह ॥ Therefore ह॒॒तः꣡, ह॒॒थः꣡ ॥ Why do we use the word ल (Personal endings)? Observe कतीह प꣡चमाना formed by शानन् added to पू [[3.2.128]], which not being a substitute of लट्, is not a personal ending like शानच् ॥ Why do we use the word <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> ? Observe, शिश्ये꣡, शिश्य꣡ति, शिश्यि꣡रे ॥ Why do we say with the exception of ह्नुङ् and इङ् ? Observe ह्नु॒॒ते꣡, यद् अधीते ॥",
    "61187": "The word उदात्त is understood here. Thus मा हि का꣡र्ष्टाम्, मा हि कार्ष्टा꣡म्; मा हि ला꣡विष्टाम् or मा हि लाविष्टा꣡म् ॥ In the last example the accent is on पि; and the reason why मा and हि are used in these illustrations, has already been explained in (VI. I. 161). The indicatory च् of सिच् the shows that by [[6.1.163]] the acute will be on the otherwise unaccented augment इट्, when it takes this augment. The सिच् being a वलादि affix will take the augment इट् [[7.2.35]], and it is a general rule that augments are unaccented; so in the above the वि would have been unaccented, and the accent would have been on the final, but for the indicatory च् of सिच्, which otherwise would find no scope. Thus वि gets acute.\n\nVart:- An affix having an indicatory प् (पित्) when coming after an Aorist by सिच् without the augment इट् (अनिट् सिच्) is in one alternative <i>udatta</i> (in the other, it is non-acute). This <i>vartika</i> restricts the scope of the <i>sutra</i> with regard to पित् affixes. Thus we get the following two forms, which otherwise would have one form only by <i>dhatu</i>-accent, namely, acute on the first, for पित् is <i>anudatta</i>. Thus माहि का꣡र्षम् or मा हि कार्ष꣡म् ॥ But when it takes the इट् augment, there are two forms (Ist.) मा हि ला꣡विषम् as a तिङन्त, (2nd.) मा हि लाविष꣡म् accent on वि [[6.1.163]]. but never मा हि लाविष꣡म् ॥ When however the augment अ is added, the accent falls on this augment [[6.4.71]].",
    "61188": "The phrase लसार्वधातुके in the locative case is understood here. Thus स्व꣡पन्ति or स्वप꣡न्ति, श्व꣡सन्ति or श्वस꣡न्ति, हिं꣡सन्ति or हिंस꣡न्ति ॥ The accent on the middle falls by the accent of the affix [[3.1.3]]. Why do we say 'before an affix beginning with a vowel'? Observe स्वप्या꣡त्, हिंस्या꣡त् ॥ Why do we say 'not taking the augment इट्?' Observe स्वपितः꣡ and श्वसितः꣡ ॥ This rule applies to those vowel-beginning affixes which are ङित्; it does not apply to स्व꣡पानि, हिन꣡सानि ॥",

    "61190": "The endings तिप् सिप् and मिप् are <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. This <i>sutra</i> applies to those personal endings which do not begin with a vowel. Thus द꣡दाति, ज꣡हाति, द꣡धाति, जि꣡हीते, मि꣡मीते ॥ The word अनुदात्त is to be construed here as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> i. e. an affix in which there is no <i>udatta</i> vowel, so that the rule may apply when a portion of the affix is elided or a semivowel is substituted : as मा हि द꣡धात्, and दधा꣡त्यत्र ॥",
    "61191": "Thus सर्वः, सर्वाः꣡ स꣡र्वे ॥ Why do we say when the case-endings follow? Observe सर्व꣡तरः, सर्व꣡तमः the acute is on र्व ॥ The word सर्व has acute on the final, as it is so taught in the <i>Unadi</i> list by निपातन् ॥ It thus being <i>anudattadi</i> takes the affix अञ् and forms सार्वः (सर्वस्य विकारः) This rule applies even when the case affix is elided in spite of the prohibition of न लुमताङ्गस्य (I. I.63): as स꣡र्वस्तोमः ॥\n\nVart:- The rule does not apply when the affix अकच् is put in : as सर्वकः꣡ ॥ Here the accent is on the final by चित् accent (VI. I. 163).",
    "61192": "This debars the accent on the beginning. Thus बिभे꣡ति, जिहे꣡ति, बिभ꣡र्त्ति, जुहो꣡ति, मम꣡त्तु नः परिज्मा ॥ Here the root मद has diversely taken in the <i>Chhandas</i> the <i>vikarana</i> श्लु, though it belongs to <i>Divadi</i> class. जज꣡नत्, इन्द्रम् ॥ The verb is here लेट् or the Vedic Subjunctive, so also is the next example. दधनत् from धन धान्ये, the इ of ति being elided by [[3.4.97]]. and the augment अट् being added by [[3.4.94]]. दध꣡नत्, दरिद्रा꣡ति, जाग꣡र्त्ति ॥ In the case of other verbs we have द꣡दाति ॥ Before affixes which have not the indicatory प् (i. e. all endings other than the three singular endings), the accent will be on the first syllable: as द꣡रिद्रति ॥",
    "61193": "Thus चिकी꣡र्षकः, जिही꣡र्षकः with the affix ण्वुल् (III. I. 133), भौरिकि꣡विधम् and ऐषुकारिभ꣡क्तम् with the affixes विधल् and भक्तल् [[4.2.54]] accent on the कि and रि ॥",
    "61194": "Thus लो꣡लूयम् or लोलू꣡यम् ॥ In the reduplicate form लोलू, the second part लू is unaccented by [[8.1.3]]. The present <i>sutra</i> makes लो accented. When लो is not accented, लू will get the accent by लित् accent. This rule is confined to polysyllabic Absolutives, namely to reduplicated Absolutives (VIII. I. 4).",
    "61195": "The word उपदेश is understood here. Thus लू꣡यते or लूय꣡ते केदारः स्वयमेव ॥ स्ती꣡र्यते or स्तीर्य꣡ते केदारः स्वयमेव ॥ When the accent does not fall on the first syllable, it falls on य (VI. I. 186). This rule applies to जन्, खन् , and सन् when they get the form जायते, सायते and खायते; the long आ [[6.4.43]] substitute is considered as if these verbs were taught in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with long आ ॥ Thus जा꣡यते or जाय꣡ते स्वयमेव सा꣡यते or सा꣡यते स्वयमेव; खा꣡यते or खाय꣡ते स्वयमेय ॥ Why do we say 'when ending in a vowel'? Observe भिद्य꣡ते स्वयमेव ॥ Why do we say \"when the sense is Reflexive (कर्तृ)\"? Observe लू꣡यते केदारो देवदत्तेन ॥",
    "61196": "Thus लु꣡लविथ, लुल꣡विथ, लुलविथ꣡, and लुलविथ꣡. As थल् has an indicatory ल्, the syllable preceding the affix may have also the accent [[6.1.193]]. Thus we get the four forms given above. In short, with इथ termination, the accent may fall on any syllable. When the थ is not सेट्, the accent falls on the root and we have one form only by लिट् accent [[6.1.193]] :- ययाथ ॥",
    "61197": "Thus गा꣡र्ग्य with यञ् (IV. I. 105), वा꣡सुदेवकः, अ꣡र्जुनकः with थुन् [[4.3.98]]. This is an exception to [[3.1.3]]. When the affixes are, however, elided, the word loses this accent, i. e. the affix does not leave its mark behind, as it generally does by [[1.1.62]]. Therefore गर्गाः꣡, बिदाः꣡, चञ्चाः꣡ having lost यञ्, अञ् and कन्, have lost their accent also.",
    "61198": "Thus दे꣡वदत्त !, दे꣡वदत्तौ !, दे꣡वदत्ताः ॥ This debars the final accent ordained by [[6.2.148]]. Though the affix may be elided by a लुमान् word (लुक्, लुप् or श्लु), yet the effect of the affix remains behind in spite of [[1.1.63]]. As स꣡र्पिरागच्छ ! स꣡प्ता गच्छत ! ॥",
    "61199": "The words पथिन् and मथिन् are derived by the <i>Unadi</i> affix इनि, (IV. 12. and 13) and are oxytone by [[3.1.3]]. They become <i>adyudatta</i> before strong cases. Thus प꣡न्थाः, प꣡न्थानौ, प꣡न्थानः, म꣡न्थाः, म꣡न्थानौ, म꣡न्थानः ॥ Before other cases we have:- पथः꣡ पश्य, मथः꣡ पश्य ॥ The accent is on the final by [[6.1.162]], there being elision of the <i>udatta</i> इन् ॥ The rule [[1.1.62]], about the remaining effect of the affix, does not apply here. As पथि꣡प्रियः, has acute on the final of the first word, by retaining its original accent.",
    "61200": "Thus क꣡र्तवै꣡, ह꣡र्तवै꣡ ॥ This is an exception to [[3.1.3]] by which त of तवै ought to have got the accent, and it also countermands rule [[6.1.158]] by which there can be only a single acute in a single word.",

It might be asked when कन् is elided, its mark, namely causing the first syllable to be acute [[6.1.197]], will remain behind by virtue of [[1.1.62]], where is then the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>.

    "61215": "Thus वे꣡णुः or वेणुः꣡; इ꣡न्धानः or इन्धा꣡नः or इन्धानः꣡ ॥ The word वेणु is derived by the <i>Unadi</i> affix णु (III. 38), which being a नित् would always have acute on the first. This allows an option. The word इन्धान, if it is formed by चानश् it will have the accent on the final. If it is considered to be formed by शानच्, the affix being a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> is <i>anudatta</i>, and as it replaces <i>udatta</i> final of the root, it becomes <i>udatta</i> [[6.1.161]], and thus इन्धान gets acute on the middle. It would never have acute on the first syllable, the present rule ordains that also.

Then the rule would apply to राजवती also, for this word is really that राजन्वती ending in अन्वती, the subsequent elision of न् is held to be non-valid for the purposes of the application of this rule [[8.2.2]]. But the change of म into व (मत् = वत्) is considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of this rule.",

    "62001": "The word पूर्वपदम् means here the accent-whether <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i> - which is in the first member: प्रकृत्या means, retains its own nature, does not become modified into an <i>anudatta</i> accent. By the rule [[6.1.223]], the final of a compound gets the accent, so that all the preceding members lose their accent and become <i>anudatta</i>, as in one word all syllables are unaccented except one. [[6.5.158]]. Thus the first member of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> would have lost its accent and become <i>anudatta</i>; with the present <i>sutra</i> commences the exceptions to the rule that the final of a compound is always, <i>udatta</i>. Thus का꣡र्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गाः ॥ The word कार्ष्ण is derived by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अञ् [[4.3.154]] from कृष्ण 'a kind of antelope;' and has the ञित् accent [[6.1.197]] i. e. on the first syllable: which the word preserves in the compound also. So also यू꣡पवलजः; the word यूप is derived from  यु by the <i>Unadi</i> affix प (<i>Unadi</i> III. 27.), before which the vowel becomes lengthened (<i>Unadi</i> III. 25) and the affix is treated as नित् (<i>Unadi</i> III. 26), and hence the word is acutely accented on the first syllable [[6.1.197]]. So also ब्रह्मचारि꣡ परिस्कन्दः; the word ब्रह्मचारिन् has a <i>Krit</i> formed word as its second part, and gets the acute on the final [[6.2.139]]. So also स्ना꣡तकपुत्रः, the word स्नातक is derived by कन् [[5.4.29]] affix and has नित् accent [[6.1.197]] i. e. <i>udatta</i> on the first syllable. So also अध्या꣡पकपुत्रः, the word अध्यापक is accented on the middle as it is formed by a लित् affix [[3.1.133]], [[6.1.193]]. श्रो꣡त्रियपुत्रः, the श्रोत्रिय being enounced with an indicatory न् in <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.84]] is acutely accented on the first. मनुष्य॑नाथः, the word मनुष्य being formed by यत् [[4.1.161]] a तित् affix is <i>svarita</i> [[6.1.185]].\n\nThe words <i>udatta</i> and <i>svarita</i> are understood in this aphorism. Therefore if all the syllables of the <i>purvapada</i> are <i>anudatta</i>, the present rule has no scope there, and such a compound will get <i>udatta</i> on the final by the universal rule enunciated in [[6.1.223]].

The word पान is formed by ल्यूट् affix added to पा, and is acute on the first [[6.1.193]] owing to the लित् accent. (4) When the first member is a word with which the second member is compared, as:- शस्त्रीश्यामा, कुमुदश्येनी, हंसगद्गदा, न्यग्रोधपरिमण्डला, दूर्वाकाण्डश्यामा, शरकाण्डगौरी ॥ These compounds are formed by [[2.1.55]]. शस्त्री is formed by ङीप् and is final-acute; कुमुद is formed by क affix (कौ मोदते = कुमुद) see [[3.2.5]]. </i>Vartika<i>)): and is acutely accented on the first, or by </i>Phit<i> </i>sutra<i> II. 3 it has acute on the first. हंस is formed by the </i>Unadi<i> affix स added to हन् (</i>Unadi<i> III. 62), and is finally accented [[3.1.3]]. न्यग्रोहति = न्यग्रोधः formed by अच् [[3.1.134]], and ह is irregularly changed into ध as </i>Panini<i> himself uses this form [[7.3.5]]: and it is accented in the middle. The words दूर्वाकाण्ड, शरकाण्ड are Genitive </i>Tatpurusha<i>, and their second member has accent on the first syllable [[6.2.135]], (5) When the first member is an Indeclinable, as, अब्राह्मणः, अवृषलः, कुब्राह्मणः, कुवृषलः ॥ निष्कौशाम्बिः, निर्वाराणासिः, अतिखट्वः, अतिमालः ॥ All these Indeclinable compounds have </i>udatta<i> on the first, they are formed by [[2.2.5]] &c.\n\nVart:- In cases of Indeclinable compounds, the rule applies only to those which are formed by the negative Particle अ, by कु, and by Particles (</i>nipata<i>). Though नञ्, is one of the </i>Nipatas<i>, its separate mention indicates that नञ्-accent debars even the subsequent कृत्-accent as अकरणिः ॥ Therefore, it does not apply here स्नात्वाकालकः which has acute on the final and belongs to </i>Mayuravyansakadi<i> class.\n\n(6) When the first member as in the accusative case, as:- मुहूर्त्तसुखम्, मुहूर्त्तरमणीयम्, सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना ॥ They are formed by [[2.1.29]]. मुहूर्त्त belongs to पृषोदरादि class and is acutely accented on the last. सर्वरात्र is formed by the </i>samasanta<i> affix अच् and is finally accented.\n\n(7) When the first member is a </i>Kritya<i>-formed word, as, भोज्यलवणम्, भोज्योष्णम्, पानीयशीतम्, हरणीयचूर्णम् [[2.1.68]]. भोज्य is formed by ण्यत् and has </i>svarita_ on the final : पानीय and हरणीय are formed by अनीयर् and are accented on the penultimate [[6.1.185]] and [[6.1.217]] i. e. on ई ॥",
    "62003": "Thus कृष्ण꣡सारङ्गी, लो꣡हितसारङ्गी, कृष्ण꣡कल्माषः, लो꣡हितकल्माषः ॥ कृष्ण is formed by मक् affix (<i>Unadi</i>. III. 4) and has acute on the final [[3.1.3]]. लोहित is formed by the affix तन् added to रुह् (<i>Unadi</i>, III. 94) and has accent on the first [[6.1.197]].\n\nWhy do we say 'color-denoting word'? Observe परमकृष्णः꣡ [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say 'with another color denoting word'? Observe कृष्णतिलाः꣡ [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say 'but not when it is एत'?

These are Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds. शम्ब is formed by adding वन् to शम् (<i>Unadi</i>. IV. 94), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. अरित्र is formed by the affix इत्र added to ऋ [[3.2.184]], and has acute on the middle [[3.1.3]]: गो is formed by डो (<i>Unadi</i> II. 68) and has acute on the final ओ; अश्व is formed by क्वन् affix added to अश् (<i>Unadi</i>. I. 151), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. The word प्रमाण here denotes 'quantity', 'measure', 'mass', 'limit', and not merely the length. The power of denoting measure by these words is here indicated by and is dependent upon accent.\n\nWhen not denoting प्रमाण we have परमगाध꣡म् and परमलवण꣡म् ॥",
    "62005": "Thus विद्या꣡दायादः, ध꣡नदायादः ॥ The word विद्या꣡ is formed by the affix क्यप् [[3.3.99]] which is <i>udatta</i> [[3.3.96]]. The word धन is derived by adding क्यु to धाञ् (<i>Unadi</i>. II. 81). Though the <i>Unadi</i> <i>Sutra</i> II. 81 ordains क्यु after the root धा preceded by नि, yet by बहुल [[3.3.1]] rule it comes after धा also when it is not preceded by नि and धन has acute on the first [[3.1.3]].\n\nIn the forms विद्यादायादः &c, what Genitive case has been taken? If it is the Genitive case which the word दायाद requires by Rule [[2.3.39]], then by the <i>Vartika</i> प्रतिपदविधाना च षष्ठी न समस्यते (II. 2. 10 <i>Vartika</i>), there can be no compounding. The Genitive case there is the ordinary Genitive case of [[2.3.50]]. i. e. a शैषिक Genitive case, and not a प्रतिपद Genitive. If it is a शेषलक्षण Genitive case, then why the other Genitive case is taught in [[2.3.39]] with regard to दायाद &c. That <i>sutra</i> only indicates the existence of the Locative case in the alternative, and does not prevent the Genitive. In fact, had merely Locative been ordained in that <i>sutra</i>, this particular case would have prevented the Genitive on the maxim that a particular rule debars the general. But the employment of both terms Genitive and Locative in that <i>sutra</i> indicates the alternative nature of the rule and shows that the Genitive case so taught is not a प्रतिपद Genitive, but a general Genitive. In short the Genitive taught in [[2.3.39]], is not an <i>apurva</i>-<i>vidhi</i>, the words naturally would have taken Genitive; the taking of the Locative is the only new thing taught there.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning inheritance'? Observe परमदायादः [[6.1.223]] taking the final acute of a compound.",

This compound belongs either to the class of <i>Mayura</i>-<i>vyansakadi</i> [[2.1.72]], or of an attribute and the thing qualified. When going to a place is delayed owing to some defective arrangement or cause, or becomes difficult, there is produced an obstacle or hinderance, and is called गमनचिरं or गमनकृच्छ्रं ॥ Why do we say 'which experiences a hinderance'? Observe मुत्रकृच्छ्रम् ॥",

Thus मूत्र꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः, उच्चार꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः ॥ Gone pretext of voiding urine or excreta.\n\nThe word मूत्र is derived by adding the affix ष्ट्रन् to the root मुच्, the ऊ being substituted for उच् of मुच्, (<i>Unadi</i>. IV. 163), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]] or it may be a word formed by घञ् to the root मूत्रयति ॥ The word उच्चार is also formed by घञ् and by [[6.2.144]] has acute on the final. The compounding takes place by [[2.1.72]] or it is an attributive compound.\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning a pretext?\" Observe विष्णोः पदम् = विष्णुपद꣡म् ॥",

So also श꣡मीनिवातम्, कु꣡ड्यनिवातम् or कुड्य꣡निवातम् ॥ The word निवात is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound = वातस्य अभावः [[2.1.6]]: or a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> = निरुद्धो वातोऽस्मिन् ॥ The words कुटीनिवातम् &c, are examples of compounds of two words in apposition. कुटी and शमी are formed by ङीष् [[4.1.41]] and have acute on the last [[3.1.3]]. Some say that कुड्य is derived from कु by adding यत् with the augment डक् and treating it as कित्, is has the acute on the first; others hold that it is derived by the affix ड्यक् to कु and the affix has the accent.\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'a shelter from wind'? Observe राजनिवाते꣡ वसति, सुखं मातृनिवातं꣡ = 'he lives under the shelter of the king'; 'pleasant is the shelter or the protection of the mother'. Here निवात = पार्श्वः or vicinity.",
    "62009": "The word आर्तव means appertaining to season (ऋतु) i. e. when the word शारद does not refer to the season of शरत् or autumn. Thus र꣡ज्जुशारदमुदकम् 'fresh drawn water'. So also दृष꣡त् शारदाः सक्तवः 'the <i>saktu</i> flour fresh from the mill'. The word शारद means here 'fresh' 'new': and it forms an invariable compound. The word रज्जु is formed by उ affix added to सृज् (<i>Unadi</i> I. 15), the स being elided. The affix उ is treated as नित् (<i>Unadi</i> I. 9) and the accent falls on the first syllable [[6.1.197]]. The word दृष꣡त् is formed by the augment ष and shortening of the vowel of the root दृ 'to tear' (दृणाति), and the affix अदिक् (<i>Unadi</i> 1. 131) and has accent on the final [[3.1.3]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when not meaning autumnal'?

The word कालाप comes from कलापिन् + अण्, (IV. 3. I08) in the sense of कलापिना प्रोक्तं [[4.3.101]], and it would have preserved its form without change before this affix [[6.4.164]] but for a <i>vartika</i> which declares that the इन् of कलापिन् will be elided (See [[6.1.144]] <i>vartika</i>). Thus कालाप gets accent on the final [[3.1.3]]. So also सर्पिर्मण्ड꣡कषायम्, उमापुष्प꣡कषायम्, दौवारिक꣡कषायम् ॥ These are Genitive compounds. The words सर्पिमण्ड and उमापुष्प are Genitive compounds and have accent on the final [[6.1.223]]. The word दौवारिक is formed by ठक् affix added to द्वार and has acute on the final [[6.1.165]].

By [[2.1.31]], सदृश forms Instrumental <i>Tatpurusha</i>. That case, however, is governed by [[6.2.2]], which provides for Instrumental compounds. The examples here given are of Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i>: and it applies to cases where the case-ending is not elided. As दास्याः꣡ सदृशो, वृषल्या꣡ सदृशः ॥ Here दासी and वृषली are finally acute, and the case-affix gets the accent when semivowel is substituted [[6.1.174]]. So also पितृ꣡प्रतिरूपः, मातृ꣡प्रतिरूपः ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning resemblance'? Observe परमसदृशः꣡, उत्तमसदृशः꣡ (VI.

The word गान्धारि belongs to the <i>Kardamadi</i> class, and is consequently acute on the first or the second (<i>Phit</i> III. 10) In the sense of पण्य we have: गोवाणिजः 'a dealer in cows', अश्ववाणिजः &c. गौ is finally accented (<i>Unadi</i> II. 67): and अश्व has acute on the first (<i>Unadi</i> I. 151) the affix being क्वन् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'the place whither one goes, or the goods in which one deals?'

The word भिक्षा is derived from भिक्ष, by the feminine affix अ [[3.3.103]], and has acute on the final [[3.1.3]]. The word समुद्र has also acute on the final as it is a word denoting 'a sea', (<i>Phit</i> <i>sutra</i> I. 2). So also with उपज्ञा, as पाणिनो꣡पज्ञमकालकं व्याकरणम्; व्या꣡डुपपज्ञं दुष्करणम् आपिशल्युपज्ञ गुरुलाघव (see [[2.4.21]]). All these are Genitive compounds. The word पाणिन is derived by अण् affix from पणिन् (पणिनोऽपत्यम् = पाणिन꣡), and has acute on the final, (III. I. 3).

The word आढ्य (तत्रैत्यैनं ध्यायन्ति) is derived from आ + ध्यै + क affix added with the force of घञ्, the ध being changed to ढ the word belonging to पृषोदरादि class [[6.3.109]], and it has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]]. The word दर्शनी꣡य is formed by अनीयर् and has acute on the penultimate नी owing to the indicatory र् [[6.1.217]]. The word सुकुमार has acute on the final by [[6.2.172]]. The word नन्द is formed by अच् [[3.1.134]]. The <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds ending in उपज्ञा and उपक्रम are neuter by [[2.4.21]].

All the above words are formed by ल्युट् affix and have acute on the syllable preceding the affix (VI. I. 193). The words <i>sukha</i> and <i>priya</i> have the sense of हित or 'well' 'good' 'beneficial', i. e. when the thing denoted by the first term is the cause of pleasure or delight.

In short, the phrase '<i>adir</i> <i>udatta</i>' should be supplied to complete the sense of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. The very next <i>sutra</i> illustrates it. That <i>sutra</i> literally means \"a word in the Locative case or a word denoting the name of the receiver of a tax or tribute, standing before a word denoting that which is lawful, but not before हरण\". To complete the sense we must supply the words \"has acute on the first syllable\". Thus स्तूपेशाणः, मुकुटे कार्षापणम्, याज्ञिकाश्वः, वैयाकरणहस्ती ॥ The word आदि 'the first syllable' is understood upto [[6.2.91]], the word उदात्त has longer stretch: it governs upto [[6.2.137]].",

The word हरण is a <i>Krit</i>-formed word, its exclusion here indicates that other <i>Krit</i>-formed words however are governed by this rule when preceded by a हारी denoting word; and thus this <i>sutra</i> supersedes the <i>Krit</i> accent enjoined by [[6.2.139]], so far.

Thus उ꣡ष्ट्रक्रोशिन्, ध्वा꣡ङ्क्षराविन्, ख꣡रनादिन् ॥ The word उपमान shows the scope of this <i>sutra</i> as distinguished from the last. So that, when the first term is an उपमान word, the preceding <i>sutra</i> will not apply, though the second member may be a णिनि formed word. When the second term is not a word denoting sound, the rule will not apply. As वृकवञ्चि꣡न्, वृकप्रेक्षि꣡न् which retain <i>krit</i> accent [[6.2.139]] Why do we say 'a radical word without any preposition'? Observe गर्दभोच्चारिन्, कोकिलभिष्याहारिन् ॥ Here the second terms radically (i.e. <i>charin</i> and <i>harin</i>) do not denote sounds, but it is with the help of the Prepositions उत् and अभि, वि and आ that they mean sound. The force of एव is that the उपमान words are restricted. Such words get acute on the first syllable only then, when the second member is a radical sound name. According to <i>Patanjali</i>, the first syllable gets acute, whether it denotes उपमान or not, when the second word is a radical denoting sound. (शब्दार्थ प्रकृतौ ह्युपमानं चानुपमानं चाद्युदात्तमिष्यते) ॥ As पुष्कलजल्पिन्, for had एव not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus: उपमानं शब्दार्थप्रकृतौ and would mean:--\"If the second member is a sound denoting radical word, then the <i>upamana</i> first member and no other will get the acute\". But this is not what is intended : because when the second member is a sound-denoting radical, the first member will get the acute, whether it is <i>upamana</i> word or not. The word एव therefore restricts <i>upamana</i>; i.e. a first member denoting उपमानं will get the accent then only, when the second term is a sound-denoting radical. If the second term is not a sound denoting radical, the first term denoting <i>upamana</i> will not get the accent. The compounding takes place by [[3.2.79]].",

Some say, these declare a restrictive rule with regard to the first and second member of these terms. Thus रोहिन् &c must be preceded by युक्त, &c and युक्त &c followed by रोहिन् &c to make this rule [[6.2.79]] applicable. Thus वृक्षारोहिन् though ending in णिनि does not take acute on the first, so युक्ताध्यायिन् ॥ 8 आगतमत्स्या or त्स्य, 9 क्षीरहोता, 10 भगिनीभर्त्ता ॥ The last two are Genitive compounds under Rule [[2.2.9]]. 11 ग्रामगोधुक्, 12 अश्वत्रिरात्रः, 13 गर्गत्रिरात्रः, 14 व्युष्टत्रिरात्रः, 15 शनपादः (गणपादः), 16 समपादः ॥ All these are Genitive compounds. 17 एकशितिपात् = एकःशितिः पादोऽस्य ॥ This is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> of three terms. The word एकशितिः is a <i>Taddhitartha</i> <i>Samasa</i> (II. I. 51), and being a <i>Tatpurusha</i>, required acute on the final, as the <i>Tatpurusha</i> accent is stronger. This declares acute on the first. Moreover by [[6.2.29]], this word एकशितिः would have acute on the first, as it is a <i>Dvigu</i> ending in a simple vowel. But the very fact that this word is enumerated here, shows that other <i>Dvigu</i> compounds in शिति are not governed by [[6.2.29]], therefore द्विशितिपाद् has acute on ति ॥ The enumeration of the एकशितिपात् further proves by implication that the (एकशितिपात् स्वरवचनं ज्ञापक निमित्तस्वरबलीयस्त्वस्य) accent for the application of which a case is present is stronger.

The word कृत् is employed in the <i>sutra</i> for the sake of distinctness; for a <i>gati</i>, <i>karaka</i> or <i>upapada</i> could not be followed by any other word than a <i>krit</i>-formed word, if there is to be a <i>samasa</i>.

According to this view we explain the accent in प्रपचतितराम्, प्रपचतितमाम्, by saying that first compounding takes place with  प्र and the words पचतितर and पचतितम ending in तरप् and तमप् and then आम्, is added and the accent of the whole word is regulated by आम् by the rule of सतिशिष्ट (see [[5.3.56]] and [[5.4.11]].

The examples will be in addition to the above:- धान्येनार्थाः = धान्यार्थः꣡ ॥ If this be so, then the word-form ऊन alone will be taken and not its synonyms like विकल &c. To this we reply, that ऊन will denote its synonyms also, by the fact of its being followed by the word अर्थ ॥ By <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.31]], ऊनार्थ and कलह [[2.1.57]] always take the Instrumental case, so we could have omitted the word तृतीयायाः, from this <i>sutra</i>, for by the maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i> &c, ऊनार्थकलहं would have referred to the compound ordained by [[2.1.31]].

So the form would have been something like हास्तिनिकम् instead of हास्तिकम् ॥ Why do we say 'with the exception of ड'? Observe श्यैनेयः, रौहिनेयः the masculine being श्येत and रोहित ॥ The word आग्नेयः (= अग्नायी देवता अस्य स्थालीपाकस्य) is an exception to this rule.\n\nVart:- The masculine-change takes place before the affixes ठक् and छस् ॥ As भवत्या श्छात्रा = भावस्काः, भवदीयाः ॥",

The word पाद in this <i>sutra</i> means 'the actual foot', a part of animal organism. Therefore पद् is not substituted before the यत् of (V.

But when it means 'alone', then those rules will not apply. The word एक is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> without any case-affix as a <i>Chhandas</i> irregularity. The examples given are of एका in the feminine which alone can be shortened, and not of एक whose final is already short.

But, as a matter of fact, it has the acute accent. As स꣡पुत्रः, स꣡भार्यः ॥ These are <i>Bahuvrihi</i>.

Therefore, when a word, denoting time, is the second member, सह would not be changed to स, because of the prohibition in [[6.3.81]]. The present <i>sutra</i> removes that prohibition by anticipation, with regard to time-denoting words even, when the meaning is that 'of the end of a book'.

Why do we say of विष्वग् and देव? Observe अश्वाची = अश्वमञ्चति, the feminine ङीप् being added by [[4.1.6]] <i>Vartika</i> The अ of अच् is elided by (VI. 4. 138.) and the final of अश्व is lengthened by [[6.3.138]].

Another reading of the <i>sutra</i> is अप्रत्यये (अञ्चतावप्रत्यये). It would give the same result, the meaning then being when no affix follows. The word वप्रत्यये or अप्रत्यये indicates by implication that in other places where simply a verb is mentioned, it means a word-form beginning with that verb which ends with some affix. For had अप्रत्यये not been used, then the rule would have applied not only when <i>anch</i> followed, but when <i>anchana</i> ending in ल्युट् also followed. The maxim धातुग्रहणे तदादि विधिरिष्यते is illustrated in अयस्कृतं and अयस्कारः; for [[8.3.46]] teaches that <i>visarga</i> is changed into स् when कृ follows. There the कृ denotes not only the root कृ but a word derived from कृ, therefore which begins with कृ, such as कारः and कृतः ॥ Therefore the rule applies to forms like अयस्कृत् which is followed merely by the verb कृ; as well as to forms like अयस्कृतः ॥\n\nVart:- In the Vedas, diversely before the feminine nouns: thus in \"विश्वाची व घृताची च\" there is no substitution in विश्वाची, but in कद्रीची there is this substitution. कद्रीची is derived from किम् + अञ्च् = कद्रि + अञ्च् ॥ Then is added ङीप् and then like अश्वाची ॥",

Therefore in निर् + वेञ् + क्त = निरुक्तम्, the vocalised vowel उ is not lengthened, as निर् is <i>upasarga</i> and not stem. So दुरुतम् ॥ Similarly [[6.4.3]], teaches the lengthening of the final before नाम्, as अग्नीनाम्, वायूनाम् ॥ But क्रिमिणाम् पश्य, पामनां पश्य, as मि and म are not the end-portions of a stem. The stem is क्रिमिणा and पामना 'a female having क्रिमि or पामन्', formed by न affix [[5.2.100]]. The forms क्रिमिणाम् and पामनाम् are Accusative Singular. Similarly [[7.1.9]] teaches that after अ, भिस् is changed into ऐस् ॥ As वृक्षैः, प्लक्षैः ॥ There also, the अ must be the अ final in an <i>anga</i> or stem : hence not here are ब्राह्मणभिस्सा, ओदनभिस्सदा, the भिस does not follow an <i>anga</i>. भिस्स means boiled rice and भिस्सदा means दधिः ॥\n\nThe maxim of अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य does not apply here; for had it been so, there would have been no necessity of making this <i>sutra</i>.

So also in <i>Samprasarana</i>, but not in निरुक्त &c as shown above.\n\n2andly -- For the purposes of एत्वं in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.68]]. The optional change of आ into ए must refer to <i>anga</i>, as ग्लेयात् or ग्लायात्, but not here निर्यायात् or निर्वायात्, for here र् is not part of the <i>anga</i>, and so र्य cannot be considered a conjunct part of <i>anga</i>.\n\n3rdly -- For the change of तु to तात् in [[7.1.35]]. There also तु must be portion of the <i>anga</i>, and not the particle तु, therefore, जीवतु or जीवतात्, but hot here जीव तु त्वम् ॥\n\n4thly -- For the substitution of इयङ् and उवङ् in [[6.4.77]]. Therefore not here श्यर्थम् and वर्यम् ॥\n\n5thly -- For the sake of नुट् augment in [[7.1.54]]. But not here are कुमारी आमिति आह ॥\n\n6thly -- For the sake of shortening of vowels. Thus [[7.4.13]] ordains the shortening of अण् vowels before क ॥ It refers to the <i>anga</i>-vowel, as कुमारिका ॥ But not here, कुमारी कस्मै स्पृहयति or कुमार्याः कं सुखं = कुमारीकं ॥\n\nAnd lastly for तत्व or त substitution. Thus [[7.4.48]] ordains the change of प् into त् in the case of अप् before भ ॥ It refers to <i>anga</i>, as अद्भिः ॥ But not here अद्भारः, for अप् here is not <i>anga</i>.\n\nTo sum up in Sanskrit : सन् सम्प्रसारण दीर्घत्वैत्वतातार्ङयङुवङ्नुट ह्रस्वत्व तत्वे च अङ्गस्येत्यधिकारे प्रयोजनं ॥\n\nThe word अङ्गस्य is in the Genitive case.

In the subsequent aphorisms, it should be read with proper case-affixes as the exigencies of each <i>sutra</i> may require. Thus in अतो भिस ऐस् [[7.1.9]] अङ्ग should be read in the ablative case: अकारान्ताद् अङ्गाद् भिसः ऐस् ॥ The Genitive case has force of स्थानषष्ठी in <i>sutras</i> like हन्तेर्ज, where the whole of हन् is replaced [[6.4.36]]. It has the force of अवयवषष्ठी in <i>sutras</i> like ऊदुपधाया गोहः [[6.4.89]]. It has the force of निमित्तनिमित्ति सम्बन्धः in युवोरनाकौ [[7.1.1]].

Thus हन् is a noun formed by the addition of the affix क्विप् to the root हन्; and the affix <i>Kvip</i> is added to it only then, when it is preceded by another word like \"<i>Brahma</i>\" &c. See [[3.2.87]]. Similarly the words पूषन् and अर्यमन् are masculine and cannot take the Neuter plural affix शि in their original state. They must be parts of a neuter compound, to admit this affix. Hence we have used words \"when the stem ends in इन् &c.\"\n\nThus बहुदण्डीनि and बहुच्छत्रीणि । बहुवृत्रहाणि । बहुभ्रूणहाणि । बहुपूषाणि । बह्वर्यमाणि ॥ सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थः । इन्हन्पूषार्यम्णामुपधायाः शावेव दीर्घो भवति नान्यत्र । दण्डिनौ ॥ छत्रिणौ । वृत्रहणौ । पूषणौ । अर्यमणौ ॥\n\nThough this result could have been obtained by [[6.4.8]], the special mention of these words shows that except in Accusative and Nominative Plural the lengthening does not take place in other strong cases. As दण्डिनौ, छत्रिणौ, वृत्रहणौ, पूषणौ, अर्यमणौ ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i> :- Regarding the rule of lengthening taught about इन् &c here, let the wise reader, after making a restrictive rule with regard to सुट् (<i>sarvanamasthana</i>) affixes in general, make again another rule regarding the affix शि in particular, (i. e., make a <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>) By so doing, the form भ्रूणहनि (Locative singular) of the <i>Acharya</i>, will not be found fault with.\n\n2. (But if <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> be not made) then I rule that the <i>anuvritti</i> of सुट् being dropped, let the rule be made with regard to शि affix in general (without regarding it as a <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> affix). And as the rule of lengthening applies to penultimates, there would arise no fault, if the vowel of हन् is lengthened before the demonstrative affix य (in words like वृत्रहायते = वृत्रहा इव आचरति, This refers to [[7.4.25]]).\n\n3. Or if the <i>anuvritti</i> of सुट् (<i>Sarvanamasthana</i>) be taken into this <i>Sutra</i>, because of the context, then the mention of शि in this <i>Sutra</i>, (would be redundant, because the word <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> includes it, so far as the strong cases are concerned) but it would find scope and utility in preventing the lengthening in those cases to which the context of <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> does not apply. That is, the <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> will be restricted with regard to इन् &c to the affix शि and not to सुट् affixes generally.\n\nNote :- शि is the affix of the Nominative and Accusative Plural in Neuter [[7.1.20]]. It is a <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> by [[1.1.42]]. But the word <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> may be read into this <i>sutra</i> from the preceding [[6.4.8]]. What is then the necessity of employing शि in this? The above <i>karika</i> answers this.\n\nIn the case of हन् ending words, the subsequent rule [[6.4.15]], which required the lengthening of the penultimate vowel before an affix having an indicatory क् or ङ्, is however debarred by the present restrictive rule. Thus the Locative Singular (ङि) is वृत्रहनि, and भ्रूणहनि ॥ How do you make this? By splitting up the present <i>sutra</i> into two parts, the first part being इन् हन् पूषार्यम्णाम्, and the second being शौ ॥ It would then mean :- (1) The penultimate vowel is lengthened, in strong cases only and no where else, when the stem ends in इन् or हन् or in पूषन् or अर्यमम् ॥ (2) So also it is lengthened before the strong case शि and no where else. These two restrictive rules therefore, would debar all other rules of penultimate lengthening which would otherwise have been applicable. But a rule which does not relate to penultimate vowel, is not debarred by this restriction, but does take effect. Thus वृत्रहायते, भ्रूणहायते denominative verbs in क्यङ् ॥ \n\nOr even though the <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> may be read into the <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i>, yet this may be considered a Restrictive Rule in general, and not only with regard to शि considered a <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> or a Neuter affix शि is the <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> affix of the Neuter : which has no other <i>Sarvanamasthana</i>, therefore, it is a general <i>Niyama</i> and not only a <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> or a Neuter <i>niyama</i>. Therefore in this <i>niyama</i> the word \"नपुंसकस्य\" - \"of the Neuter\" - is not to be taken.\n\nFor if it be taken, then the <i>Sutra</i> would mean, the neuter stems in इन् &c are lengthened in शि only and no where else. The result would be that in examples like भ्रूणहनि ब्राह्मणकुले (locative singular), there would be no lengthening at all (i.e. we shall never have the form भ्रूणहानि in locative singular by force of [[6.4.15]]; moreover, by so doing, there would arise this anomaly also, that words other than Neuter would also not be lengthened.\n\nThe force of the definition of <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> applies to Neuter also in certain cases, therefore, any rule (<i>niyama</i>) made with regard to <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> would apply to Neuter also.",
    "64013": "Thus दण्डी, वृत्रहा, पूषा, अर्यमा ॥ The न् is elided by [[8.2.7]], and the case-affix by [[6.1.68]]. in the Vocative singular we have हे दण्डिन्, हे पूषन्, हे वृत्रहन्, हे अर्यमन् ॥",

This will apply to गम् also, in this way :-\" A stem ending in a vowel is lengthened in the Desiderative, and so also of गम् which is a substitute of the vowel-stem इ\" ॥ In this way, we may see, that there is no necessity of the <i>Vartika</i>.",

    "64021": "Thus from मुर्छा — मूर्, मुरौ, मुरः, मूर्तः, मूर्तवान्, मूर्तिः, the त of <i>Nishtha</i> is not changed into  न by [[8.2.57]]. So also from हुर्छा we have हूर्, हुरौ, हुरः, हूर्णः, हूर्णवान्, हूर्त्तिः ॥ So also the व is elided, as from तूर्वीः - तूर्, तुरौ, तुरः, तूर्णः, तूर्णवान्, तूर्त्तिः ॥ धुर्वी :- धुः, धुरौ, धुरः, धूर्णः, धूर्णवान्, धूर्त्ति ॥",
    "64022": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> rule. The above translation is given according to Prof. Bohtlingk. According to <i>Kasika</i> the असिद्धवत् extends up to the end of the chapter. Dr. Ballantyne translates it thus :-\"The rules, reckoning from this one to the end of the chapter, are called <i>Abhiya</i>, because the chapter ends with a series of rules dependant on the aphorism '<i>bhasya</i>' [[6.4.129]]. When that (i. e. one of the <i>abhiya</i> rules) is to be brought into operation, having the same place for coming into operation as another <i>abhiya</i>, which has already taken effect, that one which has taken effect, shall be regarded as not having taken effect\".\n\nThe word आभात् means 'up to भ' i. e. upto [[6.4.129]]. in which last <i>sutra</i> the word भ occurs : i. e. in applying the rules taught upto [[6.4.129]]. The word अत्र shows that the two rules must have the same आश्रय or place of operation, where their places of operation are different, they are not <i>asiddha</i> to each other. The word असिद्ध shows that an <i>utsarga</i> or general rule must take effect, as if existing in spite of a special rule, and that an '<i>adesa</i>' or substitution taught by another rule should not be considered to have taken effect in applying the special rule. Thus in forming एधि and शाधि (Imperative 2nd person) ए is first substituted for अस् 'to be' by [[6.4.119]]: and for शास् by [[6.4.35]] and then is धि added by [[6.4.101]]. The latter rule says that धि is added in the Imperative, only after those roots which end in a consonant of झल् class. Now अस् and शास् end in a <i>jhal</i> consonant, and can take धि, but their substitute ए and शा end in a vowel and not a consonant and should not take धि ॥ The present rule helps us here, and for the application of धि (V1.4. 101) the substitution of ए for अस् or शा for शास् should be considered as <i>asiddha</i> or not to have taken effect. Similarly in आगाहि (Vedic Imperative, शप् being elided by [[2.4.73]] and जहि from गम् and हन्, the nasal being elided in the case of गम्, [[6.4.36]] and ज being substituted for हन् [[6.2.36]] we have the stems आग and ज, which ending in अ would require the elision of हि by [[6.4.105]]. But since the change of ज &c is not regarded as having been accomplished, the elision of हि does not take place.\n\nWhy do we say आभात् 'up to [[6.4.12]]'? In applying any other rule the changes ordained by <i>abhiya</i> rules would not be considered as <i>asiddha</i>. Thus अभाजि and रागः from भञ्ज् and रञ्ज् ॥ Here the nasals of <i>ranj</i> and <i>bhanj</i> have been elided by [[6.4.27]] — [[6.4.28]] and [[6.4.33]] before the affixes घञ् and चिण् respectively, and we have the stems रज्, and भज् to which rule [[7.2.116]] applies and we have <i>Vriddhi</i> of अ preceding the final consonant. Had the elision of the nasal been considered as non-effective for the purposes of [[7.2.116]], then अ could not have taken <i>Vriddhi</i>, as it would not then be उपधा or penultimate.\n\nWhy do we use the word अत्र in the aphorism? The rules are <i>asiddha</i> to each other with regard to a common place of operation and not otherwise. Thus पा + वस् (क्वसु) + अस् (शस् Accusative Plural ). =  पपा + उस् + अस् ([[6.4.131]] vocalisation of व). If this उ substitute be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.64]], then we cannot elide the आ of पा, because आ is not then followed by a vowel (उ being non-existent). उ however is not considered as <i>asiddha</i>, and आ being thus elided, we have पपुषः in पपुषः पश्य ॥ Similarly चि+ वस् + अस् = चिचि + उस् + अस् ॥  Here also उ is not considered <i>asiddha</i>, and we apply rule [[6.4.82]], and substitute य for उ as चिच्युषः पश्य ॥ Similarly लू + वस् + अस् = लुलू + उस् + अस् = लुलुवुषः ॥ Here also  उ is not considered <i>asiddha</i>, and we change the ऊ of लू into उव् by [[6.4.77]]. In all the above three cases, the elision of आ, or change of इ to य, or of ऊ to उव्, takes place in reference to वस्, while the <i>samprasarana</i> of व takes place with reference to the Accusative plural case-ending अस् which makes the stem <i>Bha</i>. So they have not the same आश्रय ॥ Nor does the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे apply here, because the special maxim of <i>Abhiya</i> governs the <i>sutras</i> of this section, so there cannot be the relation of <i>Antaranga</i> and <i>Bahiranga</i> among these <i>sutras</i>, simultaneously with their being <i>asiddha</i> to each other.\n\nVart:- The substitute वुक् [[6.4.88]], and युट् [[6.4.63]] should however be considered as not <i>asiddha</i>, and rule [[6.4.77]] teaching उवङ् and [[6.4.82]], teaching य् substitution should not be applied simultaneously with them. Thus भू-बभूव, बभूवतुः बभूवः with वुक्, and उपदिदीये, उपदिदीयाते, उपदिदीयिरे with युट् of [[6.4.63]]. In the case of भू, when वुक् is added, there is not the addition of उवङ्, and in the case of दीङ्, when युट् is added, there is not यणादेश ॥\n\nThe आ in आभात् has the force of limit inclusive, so that, the <i>asiddha</i> rule applies to the <i>sutras</i> governed by भ ॥",
    "64023": "Thus अनक्ति and भनक्ति from अञ्ज 'to anoint', and भञ्ज 'to break'. Thus अञ्ज् + श्नम् +तिप् = अनञ्ज् + ति (I. I. 47) = अनज् + ति [[6.4.23]] = अनक्ति ॥ So also हिनस्ति from हिसि (हिन्स्) 'to injure'. Why do we say 'after श्न' and not merely 'after न', without the indicatory श ? Observe यज्ञानाम्, यत्नानाम्, where the न of नाम् is not elided after the न of यज्ञ and यत्न, the lengthening of अ by [[7.3.102]] being <i>sthanivat</i> would not have prevented the elision. In the case of विश्नानाम् and प्रश्नानाम् (formed by विश्न + नाम् and प्रश्न + नाम्) also, the न of नाम् is not elided after श्न of विश्न ॥ For the श्न of the <i>sutra</i> is the technical श्न the <i>vikarana</i>, and not any combination of the letters श and न ॥ The <i>pratipadokta</i> maxim applies here. लक्षणप्रतिपदोक्तयोः प्रतिपदोक्तस्यैव ग्रहणम् ॥",

But नन्द्यते and नानन्द्यते, then न् is not elided, the root being written in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as टुणदि समृद्धौ, and न being added by [[7.1.58]]. Why do we say ending in a consonant? Observe नीयते, नेनीयते from नी which has a penultimate nasal, but ends in a vowel. Why do we say 'penultimate'? Observe नह्यते, नानह्यते ॥ Why do we say having an indicatory क or ङ? Observe स्रंसनं, ध्वंसनं with ल्युट् ॥\n\nVart:- The roots लङ्ग (लगि) and कम्प् (कपि) are exceptions, where meaning 'to feel pain or difficulty' and 'a disease of the body'. These, though exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with an indicatory इ, are treated as exceptions to the rule of अनिदित् : thus विलगितः and विकपितः, when not having the above meanings, we have विलङ्कितं and विकम्पितं ॥\n\nVart:- The causative of the root रञ्ज, loses its nasal when meaning 'to hunt deer' : as, रजयति मृगान् 'he hunts the deer', but रञ्जयति वस्त्राणि 'he colors the clothes'.\n\nVart:- रञ्ज loses its nasal before the affix घिनुण्, as रागी ॥\n\nVart:- The words रजकः, रजनम्, and रजः are formed from रञ्ज by the elision of the nasal.",

    "64028": "This word is derived from स्यन्द, the nasal is elided, and the <i>Vriddhi</i> prohibited irregularly.

That rule prohibits <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>, only in case of इक् vowels, here the <i>Vriddhi</i> is prevented with regard to अ ॥ The prevention of this <i>Vriddhi</i> is irregular and not governed by (I.

The स is changed to ष by [[8.3.60]]. Why do we say 'before the affixes of अ Aorist and consonant affixes'?

Therefore, when this हि is treated as पित् [[3.4.88]], then too the substitution takes place, though a पित् <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> is not ङित् [[1.2.4]].

Why do we say \"the अ is elided\"? Observe चेता, स्रोता here इ and उ have not been elided. Why do we say \"अतः with a त्\"?

Or the word हलः may be considered as in the ablative case, and then by [[1.1.54]], the first letter would be elided namely य ॥ Why have we taken [the two letters (संघात) conjointly viz.] य and not य्? Observe ईर्ष्यिता, मव्यिता, शुच्यिता from the simple roots ईर्ष्य्, मव्य्, and शुच्य् ॥ Here य् not being followed by अ, is not elided (see <i>Bhvadi</i> 541-546).

By [[7.2.15]] read with [[7.2.49]], ज्ञप् is a root which takes no इट् augment in the <i>Nishtha</i>. It may be objected that [[7.2.15]] preventing इट् augment applies to verbs of one syllable [[7.2.10]], and the causative ज्ञपि being of two syllables will always have इट् in the <i>Nishtha</i>, and so it is useless to use the word सेटि in the <i>sutra</i>. The word सेटि in the <i>sutra</i> fixes the time when the elision of णि should take place. Namely, first there should be added the augment इट् and then, there should take place the elision of णि ॥ Otherwise we shall have this difficulty कारि + त, here let us elide the णि first : and we get कार् + त, now we cannot add इट् to त, for कार् being a verb of one syllable will not take इट् by [[7.2.10]].

    "64093": "Thus अशमि or अशामि, अतमि or अतामि with चिण्; and शमंशमम्, and शामंशामं; तमंतमम् or तामंतामम् with णमुल् ॥ Why have we used the word दीर्घ in the <i>sutra</i>? The rule does not teach merely the optional shortening. So that in the alternative of short, we have अशमि and in the other alternative we have अशामि, so that there is long. For had दीर्घ not been used, it would have taught optional short only, i. e. it would be a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि only, and there will be this difficulty :- when the causative of causative is taken, as in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते, there would not be lengthening in the alternative. Because the <i>lopa</i> substitute of णि would be <i>sthanivat</i> : therefore, the णि which would be followed by चिण् or णमुल्, would not have in it the मित् <i>anga</i>, because the first णि intervenes between the मित् <i>anga</i> and the चिण् and णमुल् affix, and that णि which is preceded by a मित् <i>anga</i> is not followed by चिण् and णमुल्, because the second णि (though elided) intervenes. Therefore, there would not be optional short here, but compulsory short, by the preceding <i>sutra</i> and no lengthening. The rule, therefore, teaches the optional substitution of the long (दीर्घ). For there arises no such anomaly in this view. For taking this rule to be a दीर्घविधि, the <i>lopa</i>-substitution of णि would not be <i>sthanivat</i>, by the express prohibition contained in (l. 1. 58), and so we can get forms of double causatives. But if we take it a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि, then the <i>lopa</i>-<i>adesa</i> of णि being <i>sthanivat</i>, would prevent getting the alternative long form. Therefore the word दीर्घ is used in the <i>sutra</i> to make this rule a दीर्घविधि, and prevent <i>sthanivat</i>-<i>bhava</i>. Thus take the causative of शम्, which will be शमि by the last <i>sutra</i>. Take its Intensive with यङ्, शमि + यङ् which causes doubling by [[6.1.9]] = शमि शमि + यङ् = शशमि + यङ् [[7.4.60]] = शं शमि + यङ् (नुक् or nasal being added to the <i>abhyasa</i> by [[7.4.85]]) = शंशमि + यङ् = शंशम् + य [[6.4.51]] = शंशम्य. Add णिच् to this i. e. make the causative of the Intensive. शंशम् + य + इ ॥ Then the अ of य is elided by [[6.4.48]] = शं शम् + य् + इ. Then य् is elided by [[6.4.49]] = शंशम् + इ = शंशमि ॥ This शंशमि is the causative root of the Intensive of the causative शम् ॥ Now add चिण् or णमुल् to this root; and we get two forms short and long अशंशमि or अशंशामि with चिण् and शंशमम् or शंशामम् with णमुल् ॥ The long forms could not have been obtained had this not been a दीर्घविधि, for then the <i>lopa</i>-<i>adesa</i> of णिच् being <i>sthanivat</i> would have prevented the application of दीर्घ ॥ The roots शम् and तम् (both <i>Divadi</i>) ending in म् do not ever lengthen the root vowel before चिण् and णमुल् by [[7.3.34]]. The present <i>sutra</i>, therefore, does not apply to the simple roots. The derivative causative roots of these, namely, शमि - शमयति, तमि — तमयति, optionally lengthen the penultimate before these affixes. Thus शमि + चिण् = शम् + चिण् (the इ of णि being elided by VI. 4. 51) शामि or शमि (with the augment अ = अशामि or अशमि) ॥ This rule applies when the Causative of the Causative root takes these affixes. In fact, the mention of the word दीर्घ implies as much, otherwise the <i>sutra</i> could have been made without this word, for the word 'optionally' would have brought in both 'short' and 'long'. Thus in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he causes another to make quiet,' we add णि (the Causative sign.), to the Causative root शमि, as शमि + णि = शम् + इ [[6.4.51]] = शामि, the <i>lopadesa</i> here is not <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of lengthening (दीर्घविधि) the अ of शम् [[1.1.58]] ॥ From this शामि with चिण् we get अशामि, and with णमुल् we get शामम् ॥ But we cannot get the short forms, by taking the other alternative, as the <i>lopadesa</i> will then be <i>sthanivat</i>. Hence the necessity of the word दीर्घ in the <i>sutra</i>. Thus the चिण् and णमुल् forms of the Causative of the Causative (i.e. the double Causative) of शम् are अशमि or अशामि; शमंशमम् or शामंशामम् and from the form शंशमयति, we have अशंशमि or अशंशामि, शंशमंशंशमम् or शंशामंशंशामम् ॥ These latter are from the Causative stems of the Intensive root. The sign यङ् of the Intensive has been elided [[6.4.49]] as shown above.",

The word एव 'only' is for the sake of perspicuity. अहन् alone does not lose its final अन् before ट and ख, other stems also do the same.

Instead of making the <i>sutra</i> simpler by saying ओरोत् 'let ओ be substituted for उ or ऊ', the employment of the technical phrase गुणः in the aphorism indicates the existence of the following maxim संज्ञा पूर्वको विधिरनित्यः \"A rule is not universally valid, when that which is taught in it, is denoted by a technical term\". The present <i>sutra</i> is, therefore, <i>anitya</i>, and we have forms like स्वायंभुवः from स्वयंभू without <i>guna</i>. See [[7.4.30]] also.",

    "64148": "Thus दाक्षी, प्लाक्षी, सखी from दाक्षि, प्लाक्षि and सखि with the feminine affix ई [[4.1.65]] The above forms could also have been evolved by the simple rules of <i>sandhi</i>, as दाक्षि + ई = दाक्षी ॥ It might be asked, where was then the necessity of eliding इ? There would arise difficulty in the forms like अति सखि ॥  From the word सखी formed by ङीष् under [[4.1.62]], we form the compound सखीमतिक्रान्तः = अतिसखि, the final becoming short by [[1.2.48]] (the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् is not added here as required by [[5.4.91]], that rule applying to the masculine form सखि and not to the feminine सखी). Now if in forming सखि + ई = सखी, had we not elided the letter इ of खि, then the long  ई being the single substitute for both इ + ई, would be considered as like the final इ of सखि by [[6.1.85]]. That being so, the word अतिसखि would be considered a non-घि word by (I .4. 7), for सखि has been specifically excluded form घि class. Not being a घि, we cannot have the form अतिसखेः in the Ablative and Genitive singular. Hence the necessity of eliding इ before the feminine ई, so that the <i>ekadesa</i> rule [[6.1.85]], should not apply.\n\nThe short इ is elided before <i>Taddhita</i> affixes:- दुलि — दौलेयः, वलि — वालेयः, अत्रि — आत्रेयः ॥ अ is elided before ई as :- कुमार — कुमारी, गौर — गौरी, शार्ङ्गरव — शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ अ and आ are elided before the <i>Taddhita</i> :- दक्ष - दाक्षि, प्लक्ष — प्लाक्षिः, चूड — चौडिः, बलाका — बालाकिः, सुमित्रा — सौमित्रिः ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of ई (शी), when it is the substitute of औ [[7.1.18]], being the case-affix of the nominative, and accusative dual in the neuter, and of certain feminine in long आ ॥ Before this ई, the preceding vowel, इ and अ are not elided. The stem before this ई is also <i>bha</i> by (I .4.18) in the case of Neuter nouns. Thus काण्ड + ई = काण्डे; कुड्ये ॥ सौर्य + ई = सौर्ये (the य would have been elided by [[6.4.149]]. It is owing to this <i>Vartika</i>, that we have inserted the word 'feminine' in the translation of the <i>sutra</i>. This may also be done by reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of श्यां [[6.4.136]], and न [[6.4.137]] into this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nVart:- इयङ् and उवङ् are superseded, when they would apply simultaneously with this <i>lopa</i>. Thus इयङ् and उवङ् have unimpeded scope in श्री or भ्रू + औ or अस् (जस्), as श्रियौ, श्रियः, भ्रुवौ, भ्रुवः ॥ <i>Lopa</i> has unimpeded scope in कमण्डलू — कामण्डलेयः (with ढञ् [[4.1.135]]), and भाद्रवाहेयः ॥ But in वत्सप्री + ढञ् [[4.1.135]], both the rules [[6.4.77]] and [[6.4.148]], present themselves. The former is superseded, and we have वात्सप्रेयः (वत्सं प्रीणाति = वत्सप्रीः, तस्यापत्यं); so also लैखाभ्रेयः with the ढक् affix, this word belonging to <i>Subhradi</i> class [[4.1.123]].",
    "64149": "Thus सूर्येणैकादिक् = सौरी (सूर्य + अण् under [[4.3.112]] = सौर्य, then ई of ङीप् = सौरी), as सौरी बलाका ॥\n\nSo also तिष्य — तैषमहः, तैषी रात्रिः ॥ So also अगस्त्यस्यापत्यं स्त्री = आगस्ती [[4.1.114]], आगस्तीयः; So also मत्स्य — मत्सी with ङीष् as it belongs to <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.40]]. If the words सूर्य &c, were to be qualified by the word भ, then the <i>sutra</i> would mean सूर्यादीनां भसंज्ञानां \"of सूर्य &c, when they get the designation of भ\"; and the result of this interpretation would be, that the rule would apply to cases like सूर्यस्य स्त्री = सूरी, आगस्त्यस्य स्त्री = आगस्ती &c, only, where the forms सूर्य &c, are <i>Bha</i>, and not to their derivatives, as सौर्य &c: and there would not have been the forms like सौरी बलाका; because, here the word सूर्य is not <i>Bha</i> before the affix ई, but the word सौर्य is <i>Bha</i>. Hence we have introduced the words \"and their derivatives\" in the translation, so as to cover the cases like सौरी बलाका ॥\n\nIn the last example, we again have an illustration, of the rule [[6.4.22]], which says that for purposes of <i>asiddha</i> the आश्रय must be the same. Thus सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + अ <i>lopa</i> + ई = सौरी ॥ But सौर्य itself was formed by the elision of अ of सूर्य before the affix अण्, thus, सूर्य + अण् = सौर्य् + ० + सौर्य् (last <i>sutra</i>) = सौर्य ॥ But if this <i>lopa</i> be considered as <i>asiddha</i> by [[6.4.22]], then we have the following equation सौर्य् + ० + अ (of अण्) + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ० (अ of अण् being elided by [[6.4.148]] + ई ॥ Here य् cannot be elided, as it is not <i>upadha</i> or penultimate: because the first <i>lopa</i> is considered <i>asiddha</i>. But it is not to be so considered, as their scopes (आश्रय) are different. Hence we have the elision of य् by this <i>sutra</i>. It should not be objected that the य् here is not penultimate, but ultimate: as सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ई (अ elided by the last <i>sutra</i>), and thus य् is ultimate. Here, however, rule [[6.4.22]], applies. This elision of अ will be considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the elision of य्, their scope being the same. So being considered <i>asiddha</i>, य् still retains its designation of <i>upadha</i> and is elided by the present <i>sutra</i>. It should be remembered here, that we could not take help of the rule of <i>sthanivat</i>-<i>bhava</i>, because for purposes of यलोप, that rule is set aside. See [[1.1.58]].\n\nWhy do we say the penultimate य्? Observe मत्स्यचरी ॥ This word is thus formed. The affix चरट् is added to मत्सी by [[5.3.53]], in the sense of मत्सी भूतपूर्वा ॥ Then the मत्सी becomes masculine मत्स्य by [[6.4.35]], and we have मत्स्यचर ॥ This word takes ङीप् by [[4.1.15]], because it is formed by an affix having an indicatory ट् ॥ Thus मत्स्यचर + ई, and the word is भ, but the य is not elided, because it is not penultimate. The य has been read for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> : उपधायाः alone would have been enough for the purposes of this aphorism. The rule contained in this <i>sutra</i> is rather too general; it is limited by the following <i>vartikas</i>, which enumerate the conditions under which the elision takes place.\n\nVart:- The य of मत्स्य is elided before the feminine ई only: therefore not here मत्स्यस्येदं मांसं = मात्स्यम् ॥  \n\nVart:-  Of सूर्य and अगस्त्य before the affixes छ, and ई (of the feminine): as सौरीयः, सौरी, आगस्तीयः, आगस्ती ॥ But not here सौर्यं चरुं निर्वपेत्, आगस्त्य formed with the Patronymic अण् (IV. I. 114)\n\nVart:- Of तिष्य and पुष्य when referring to asterisms, as, तिष्येण नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः = तैषः, पौषः [[4.2.3]].\n\nVart:- Of अन्तिक before the affix तसि, the क is elided, and the word has acute on the first syllable : as, अन्तितः in अन्तितो न दूरात्[[5.4.45]].\n\nVart:- Before the affix तम, it loses the syllable तिक as well as क, as अन्तमः or अन्तितमः, in अग्रे त्वं नो अन्तिमः अन्तितमे अवरोहति ॥\n\nVart:- The elision of क of अन्तिक takes place diversely, before the second member also, as अन्तिके सीदति = अन्तिषत् (स changed to ष by [[8.3.106]])\n\nVart:- The elision takes place also before the affix य, as अन्तियः, this is found in the <i>Atharva</i>-<i>Veda</i>, (अन्तिके भवः, with the affix यत् [[4.4.110]]).",

If they do not belong to that class, the affix is added irregularly : दण्डिनोऽपत्यं = दाण्डिनायनः &c. The final इन् is not elided. (3) अथर्वन् belongs to <i>Vasantadi</i> class [[4.2.63]]. The science or work of <i>Atharvan</i> <i>Rishi</i> is also called <i>Atharvan</i>. He who studies that work is called <i>Atharvanika</i>: the final is not elided before the इक् affix.

The finals of the stems are not dropped. (6 and 7) These are derived from भ्रूणहन् and धीवन् with the affix ष्यञ्, and न् being replaced by त = भ्रूणघ्नो भावः, धीव्नो भावः ॥ हन् takes त before affixes having an indicatory ण or ञ् by [[7.3.32]]: it might be said त would be added to भ्रूणहन् before ष्यञ् by that rule. That rule is, however, confined to affixes which come after roots only, and not to <i>Taddhita</i> affixes. That rule does not apply to cases like भ्रौणघ्नी, वार्त्रघ्नः ॥ The त in <i>Bhraunhatya</i> is therefore, an irregularity. (8) सारव is from सरयू with the affix अण्, the final अयू being elided, सरय्वां भवः = सारवमुदकं ॥ (9) The son of इक्ष्वाकु, with अञ् affix [[4.1.168]], the final उ is elided, or ईक्ष्वाकुषु जनपदेष् भवः = ऐक्षाकः with अण् affix [[4.2.132]]. Accent on the first or the final. The irregularity consists in the elision of final उ ॥ As one word is ऐक्ष्वाकः and the other ऐक्ष्वाकः, the <i>sutra</i> ought to have read this word twice, strictly speaking.

The plural of मैत्रेय will be मित्रयवः (the plural of मित्रयु); as it belongs or <i>Yaskadi</i> class and loses the affix in the plural [[2.4.63]]. Another form of this word is मैत्रेयिक formed under [[7.3.2]]. It might be objected that had मित्रयु been read in <i>Bidadi</i> class [[4.1.104]], it would have taken the affix अञ्, and the form मैत्रेय would have been evolved regularly: as मित्रयु + अञ् = मित्र + इय [[7.3.2]] + अ = मैत्रेयः ॥ This would have prevented also the necessity of including this word in the <i>Yaskadi</i> class [[2.4.63]], for then by [[2.4.63]], अञ् formed words would lose the affix in the plural and we would have got the form मित्रयवः in the plural. So far it would have been all right, but if मैत्रेय were to be formed with अञ् affix, as proposed, then the संघ derivative of this word would have required to be formed with अण् affix under [[4.3.127]], and not with वुञ् under [[4.3.126]]; but we require वुञ्, as मैत्रेयकः संघः ॥ (11) हिरण्मय from हिरण्य with मयट् with the elision of य, हिरण्यस्य विकारः = हिरण्मयः ॥",

I. 133), as कृ+ण्वुल् = कारकः, हारकः ॥ So also वुन् [[4.3.98]] as वासुदेवकः, अर्जुनकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say nasalised यु and वु ? Observe ऊर्णाया युस् [[5.2.123]] Here the यु is not replaced by अन, and we have ऊर्णायुः ॥ So also in भुजिमृङ्भ्यां युक्त्युकौ ॥ Here the यु of युक् and त्युक् (<i>Unadi</i> III. 21) are not replaced by अन; as भुज्युः and मृत्युः ॥ In the affixes above mentioned, the semi-vowel is not considered to have the nasal. There are no visible marks of nasality on any affixes, but the maxim is प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्याः पाणिनीयाः ॥\n\nThe word युवोः is the Genitive Singular of युवु considered as a single word, i.e. a <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvandva</i> compound in the singular, and such compounds are always neuter [[2.4.17]]. The Genitive Singular of युवु is therefore युवुनः the augment being added by (VII. I. 73). The anomalous form युवोः shows the existence of the maxim that a rule ordaining an augment is not universally valid (अनित्यमागमशासनम्) ॥ Or the युवु may be considered as masculine <i>Dvandva</i>, and then it proves the maxim that the gender need not be taught, the usage of the people settles the gender of a word (लिङ्गमशिष्यं, लोकाश्रयत्वाल्लिङ्गस्य)॥ If, however, युवू be considered an <i>itaretara</i>-<i>yoga</i> <i>Dvandva</i> compound, then its Genitive dual will be युव्वोः, one व् is elided as a <i>Chhandas</i> irregularity, or the ऊ is elided, and we have the युव् + ओः = युवोः an anomalous dual.\n\n<i>Karika</i> :- If युवू is taken as a dual, then there ought to be a semi-vowel (i.e. युव्वोः); if it is considered as Aggregate Singular, then it ought to be neuter, how is then युवोः masculine? (To this we answer), if it be taken as dual युवू, then there is elision of the यणादेश (i.e. व्); if it be taken as singular युवु, then the augment नुम् which comes in the Genitive Singular of Neuters, does not come here, proving that the rule of नुम् augment is <i>Anitya</i> (not of universal application). Or the word युवु is taken as masculine, because the Gender depends upon usage.",

Thus ख is not acute, but ई of ईन् substituted for it. Similarly in [[4.4.117]], the affix taught is घच् with an indicatory च्, showing that the final of the affix इय will be acute [[6.1.163]], and not of घ, for घ would have been acute by the general rule affix.\n\nIn शमेर्ढः (<i>Unadi</i> 1.99), शमेः ख (<i>Unadi</i> I: 102), the ढ  and ख remain unchanged, and we have शाण्डः, and शंखः ॥ This is explained on the maxim of उणादयो बहुलम् [[3.3.1]]. In the <i>sutra</i> ऋतेरीयङ् [[3.1.29]], the affix ईयङ् has been taught and not छङ्, this shows that the rule of substitution herein taught does not apply to the affixes to be added to the verbal roots. Thus एजेः खश् [[3.2.28]], पदरुजविशस्पृशो घञ् [[3.3.16]]. Here the ख and घ are not be replaced by ईन and इय ॥ In fact, they cannot be regarded as affixes, but only as इत् or servile letters. By [[1.3.8]], the gutturals are इत् except in <i>Taddhita</i> : therefore, the substitutions take place in <i>Taddhita</i> affixes, where the ख and घ are not इत् ॥\n\nThe final म् in आयन् and इन् should not, however, be considered as servile (इत्) though they be final consonants. This we infer from the <i>sutra</i> प्राचामवृद्धात् फिन् बहुलम् ॥ Here the न् of फिन् is indicatory, showing the position of the accent. But फ is replaced by आयन्, so if the न् of आयन् were also to be indicatory (इत्) there would have been no necessity of adding म् in फिन् ॥ Hence the fact of this न् in फिन् shows that the न् in आयन् and इन् are not इत् ॥",

The word अनतः qualifies झ, the झ should be immediately preceded by a stem ending in a non-अ; if some other letter intervenes, the rule will not apply.

Observe खट्वाभिः, मालाभिः ॥  The <i>adhikara</i> of \"अतः\" ('after a short अ'), extends up to [[7.1.17]].\n\nThe form अतिजरसैः illustrates some important principles of grammar.  अति + जरा = (जरामतिक्रान्तः) अतिजर (अ being shortened by [[1.2.48]]). The word अतिजर ends in अ, and there fore forms its Instrumental plural by ऐस् ॥ Thus अतिजर + ऐस् ॥ Now we apply [[7.2.101]], which says for जरा is substituted जरस् before vowel-beginning case-endings. It should not be objected, that the substitution is ordained for जरा and not जर; for the maxim एकदेशविकृतमनन्यवद् भवति (a tail-less dog is still a dog) applies here. Having made this substitution, we get अतिजरसैः ॥ Nor should you object that it was the अ of जर which had given occasion to the existence of ऐस्, and that अ should not be destroyed, on the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद् विघातस्य, for this maxim is not universal, as <i>Panini</i> himself shows in employing the form कष्टाय (III. I. 14), in which ए of the Dative is changed into य by [[7.1.13]], and then this very य causes the destruction of अ and makes it आ (See [[7.1.13]] also).\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- If there be substitution of ए for the final  अ before the affix भिस् by the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.103]], where will then the present <i>sutra</i>, causing the substitution of ऐस् for भिस् after stems ending in अ, find its scope, (because there will be no stem left ending in अ)? If even after changing अ into ए, you change the भिस् into ऐस्, because the ए was once अ (भौतपूर्व्यात्); then the rule of changing भिस् into ऐस् becomes a <i>nitya</i> rule, because it takes effect even after the application of rule [[7.3.103]], and being <i>nitya</i> it debars that rule. Thus वृक्ष + भिस् ॥ Here the subsequent rule [[7.3.103]], requires the अ to be changed into ए ॥ Thus वृक्षे + भिः Now the present rule cannot apply because there is no अदन्त stem. However, is considering that वृक्षे once was अदन्त, we change भिः to ऐस् then the rule becomes a <i>nitya</i> rule. In fact, it is a <i>nitya</i> rule and debars the application of [[7.3.103]], within its jurisdiction, [[7.3.103]], finds its scope in वृक्ष + सु = वृक्षेषु ॥",

And the case of तातङ् is to be distinguished from अनङ्, for in अनङ् the ङ् has no other object but to prevent <i>sarvadesa</i>; but in तातङ् we see that ङ् has another object, namely, the prevention of <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i> ; and ङ् having thus found scope, the तातङ् substitute will be governed by the general rule अनेकाल् शित् सर्वस्य [[1.1.55]].\n\nThe <i>Karika</i> given below raises these points.\n\n<i>Karika</i> :-\n\nतातङि ङित्त्वं संक्रमकृत्स्यादन्त्यविधिश्चेत्तच्च तथा न ।\nहेरधिकारे हेरधिकारो लोपविधौ तु ज्ञापकमाह ॥\nतातङो ङित्त्वसामर्थ्यान्नायमन्त्यविधिः स्मृतः ।\nन तद्वदनङादीनां तेन तेऽन्त्यविकारजाः ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- In तातङ् the ङ् is for the sake of preventing <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i> (संक्रम = गुणवृद्धिप्रतिषेधः)॥ If it be said, it is for the sake of अन्त्यविधि by [[1.1.53]]; we say it is not so. (If you say that after roots ending in short अ, तात् should be elided, by [[6.4.105]] read with [[1.1.56]], we reply): when the <i>anuvritti</i> or <i>adhikara</i> of हि was already existent in the <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.105]] from <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.101]], the express employment of हि in [[6.4.105]], indicates that the <i>lopa</i> rule does not apply to तातङ् ॥ (The <i>lopa</i>-rule not applying to तातङ्, it follows that it replaces the whole of हि and not only its final). The ङ् in तातङ् finds its scope in preventing <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>, therefore, it is not for the sake of <i>antya</i> <i>vidhi</i> [[1.1.53]]. The ङित्व in अनङ् &c has no other scope, therefore, these substitutes replace the final only.",
    "71036": "Thus विद्वस् (nominative singular विद्वान्), विद्वांसौ, विद्वांसः ॥ The words formed with affixes having an indicatory उ or ऋ (उगित्) add a म् in their strong cases [[7.1.70]], and form their feminine with unaccented ई ॥ शतृ is an affix having an indicatory ऋ, therefore its substitute would also be considered as having an indicatory ऋ, the उ of वसु therefore is not absolutely necessary for the purposes of उगित् operations. वसु is so written, in order that in the <i>sutra</i> वसो संप्रसारणं (VI. 4. 131.), both क्वसु and वसु should be included. Nor can we object that in the above mentioned <i>sutra</i>, वसु with one indicatory letter being taken, cannot include an affix like क्वसु having two indicatory letters, -- on the maxim एकानुबन्धकग्रहणे न द्व्यनुबन्धकस्य -- for if that were so, there was no necessity of उ in वसु ॥ Some read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word optionally into this : and we have विदन्, विदन्तौ, विदन्तः formed with शतृ (see [[5.4.38]]).",
    "71037": "Thus प्रकृत्य, प्रह्रत्य ॥ The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.21]], the compounding is by [[2.2.18]], and तुक् by [[6.1.71]]. पार्स्वतः कृत्य, The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.61]]. and compounding is by [[2.2.22]]. नानाकृत्य; द्विधाकृत्य The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.62]]. Why do we say 'in a compound'? Observe कृत्वा हुत्वा. Here the counter example is हृत्वा, which is preceded by an Indeclinable कृत्वा, but as it is not compounded, there is no substitution. Why do we say 'not preceded by नञ्'? Observe अकृत्वा, अहृत्वा, परमकृत्वा, उत्तमकृत्वा ॥ The word अनञ् means 'other than नञ्', and means words of the same class as नञ्, i. e. Indeclinables : and does not mean words which are not Indeclinables. The compounds like स्नात्वाकालक contained in the class of मयूरव्यंसक &c (II. 1. 72.), do not take ल्यप anomalously. Or the word समासे is in the Locative with the force of specification : and means those compounds which are specifically formed with क्त्वा and not any compound in general.\n\nNow by the rule [[1.1.72]], <i>ktva</i> would denote a form ending with <i>ktva</i>; and would include the case of a compound ending in <i>ktva</i>. But this general rule is modified by the maxim प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहित स्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम् \"an affix denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added and ends with the affix itself.\" But the affix <i>ktva</i> is never ordained after a compound. Therefore, the case of compounds ending in <i>ktva</i>, would not be covered by the mere employment of <i>ktva</i>. Then comes the imaxim कृद्ग्रहणे गति कारक पूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं 'a <i>krit</i> affix denotes whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that <i>krit</i> affix has been added and which ends with the <i>krit</i> affix, but moreover should a <i>gati</i>, or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the <i>krit</i> affix must denote the same word-form together with the <i>gati</i> or the noun which may have been prefixed to it.\" By this a compound also may end in <i>ktva</i>. This maxim will cover cases like प्रकृत्य, पार्श्वतः कृत्य but not उच्चैः कृत्य &c because उच्चैः is neither a <i>gati</i> nor a <i>karaka</i>. Hence the employment of the word समासे in the <i>sutra</i>, and also of the word अनञ्पूर्वे, for नञ् is neither a <i>Gati</i> nor a <i>Karaka</i>.\n\nIn the case of प्रधाय and प्रस्थाय this maxim applies :-अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गो ल्यप् बाधते \"a <i>Bahiranga</i> substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even <i>antaranga</i> rule\". What are these <i>antaranga</i> rules superseded by the substitute ल्यप्? (1) हित्वं - the substitution of हि for धा [[7.4.42]]. Thus हित्वा but प्रधाय and not प्रहित्वा ॥ (2) दत्वं - the substitution of दद् for दो [[7.4.46]] — as दत्वा, but प्रदाय and not प्रदत्वा ॥ (3) आत्वं as required by [[6.4.42]]: as खात्वा, प्रखाय and प्रखन्य ॥ (4) इत्वं - as स्थित्वा but प्रस्थाय ॥ (5) ईत्वं by [[6.4.66]], as पीत्वा but प्रपाय ॥ (6) दीर्घत्वं by [[6.4.15]], as शान्त्वा but प्रशम्य ॥ (7) शुट् by [[6.4.19]], as पृष्ट्वा but आपृच्छ्य ॥ (8) ऊठ् — as द्यूत्वा ॥ (9) इट् [[7.2.56]] — देवित्वा but प्रदीव्य ॥",

Thus [[3.3.103]] says that आ is added in the feminine to a root which ends in a consonant and has a prosodially long vowel. The root कुडि must be considered to be such a root and कुण्डा, हुण्डा are thus formed. Similarly though the roots in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> are धिवि and कृवि, in applying affixes we must consider them as धिन्व् and कृन्व्, as the author himself has indicated in [[3.1.80]]. In short, in adding affixes, these roots should be considered as having न् ॥ Moreover the root (<i>dhatu</i>) should have इ, and not the stem (<i>anga</i>). The affixes तासि (Future) and सिच् (Aorist) when added to roots, will not make those roots इदित्; for the इ in तासि and सिच् is merely for the sake of pronunciation, and is not to be considered as इत् in the strict sense of the word: in fact it should be considered as non-nasalised. If you say that \"the इ in सिच् should be considered as इत्, for because of its being इत्, the न् of मन् is not elided by [[6.4.24]] in अमंस्ता\", we reply, \"not so, the न् is not elided, because <i>sutra</i> हनः सिच् (1. 2. 14) makes सिच् a कित् after हन् only, the result of which is that हन् only loses its न् by [[6.4.37]], and no other root\". In मन्ता = मन् + तासि + डा = मन् + त् + आ (the आस् is elided [[6.4.143]]). For the purposes of the elision of न्, the elided आस् would be considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]], for both [[6.4.143]], and [[6.4.37]], requiring the elision of न् are <i>abhiya</i> <i>sutras</i>. In भेत्ता, छेत्ता from भिदिर् and छिदिर् the whole combination इर् is इत्, and not इ and र् separately, and hence नुम् is not added. But even if these roots be considered as इदित्, the syllable इर् having an इ, yet they will not get the नुम् augment, because the word अन्त of पादान्ते [[7.1.57]] is understood here in this <i>sutra</i> also, so that the roots must have a final इ as इत् for the application of this rule.",

Had the नुम् been added after the addition of the affix, then यत् would be added by [[3.1.98]].

The specific mention of अधातोः shows that the prohibition applies to original roots, and not to those roots which are derived from nouns. Thus गोमन्तमिच्छति = गोमत्यति formed by क्यच् ॥ Here गोमत्य is a derivative root, in its primitive state it was a noun. The prohibition of अधातोः will not apply to this root and नुम् will be added. Thus गोमत्य + क्विप् = गोमत्य् + ० (the अ is dropped by [[6.4.48]] = गोमत् + ० (the य् is elided by [[6.4.50]]). Now is added नुम् and we have गोमान् ॥",

Observe कुण्डे, पीठे ॥ The phrase \"before an affix beginning with a vowel\" is employed here for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> like [[7.1.75]]. Here we could have dispensed with it: for before affixes beginning with a consonant नुम्, would be elided by [[8.2.7]]. The only object that it serves here is that we can form हे त्रपो ! or हे त्रपु ! in the Vocative singular. For had we त्रपुन् + स् in the vocative, the form would have been हे त्रपुन् like हे राजन्, for न् would not be elided here, see [[8.2.8]].\n\nIf it be objected that by the <i>sutra</i> न लुमताङ्गस्य [[1.1.63]] when the affix स् is elided in the Vocative, it will leave no trace behind, and there being no affix at all, नुम् will not be added in the Vocative. We reply: that this very employment of the word अच् in this <i>sutra</i> indicates (<i>jnapaka</i>) that the rule prohibiting the effect of an affix [[1.1.63]] does not apply here. Therefore, though the affix is elided, it produces its effect in spite of [[1.1.63]], and we have the <i>guna</i> of the vowel in the Vocative, as हे त्रपो by [[7.3.108]].\n\nWhy have we used the word विभक्तौ 'when a case-affix follows'? Observe तुम्बुरवं चूर्णम्, where the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अञ् is added to तुम्बुरु by [[4.3.139]].\n\n<i>Karika</i>: - The employment of the words इकः अचि in the <i>sutra</i> shows that नुम् will not come when the affix begins with a consonant, as त्रपुभ्यां, त्रपुभिः ॥ An objector says, the employment of अचि in the <i>sutra</i> is useless for नुम् may be added even before an affix beginning with a consonant, for having added it, it will be elided by न लोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य [[8.2.7]]. We reply, yes it can be so done, but how will you then manage the accent? For in पञ्चत्रपुभ्यां, पञ्चत्रपुभिः, the accent is regulated by the rule [[6.2.29]] which says that in a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, the first member preserves its original accent if the second member ends in an इक् vowel. But if there was a नुम्, then the second member would not end in इक् but in न् : and the elision of this न् by [[7.2.7]] is <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of accent. To this the objector answers, that even where न् is not elided the accent is governed by [[6.2.29]], namely the accent of पञ्चत्रपुणे or पञ्चत्रपुण : is by [[6.2.29]], why should it not be so when न् is elided. So the objection about accent has no strength.\n\nWell if नुम् be added even before consonant-affix, then there will arise this anomaly: अतिरि + भ्यां = अतिरिन् + भ्यां (by adding नुम्). Here rule [[7.2.85]] cannot apply: because न् intervenes between रि and भ्यां, therefore इ of रि is not changed to आ, and therefore we cannot get the proper from अतिराभ्यां ॥ Moreover in प्रियत्रि + भ्यां, the त्रि cannot be changed to तिसृ if there be नुम्, and so we cannot get the form प्रियतिसृभ्यां ब्राह्मणकुलानि ॥\n\nTo this it is answered, the change of इ into आ in the case of रि, and the substitution of तिसृ for त्रि will take place even when the नुम् intervenes, on the maxim विभक्तिविधानदशायां यदानन्तर्ये तत् तत्राश्रीयते न त्वादेशविधानदशायाम् ॥ And this is done in this way : अतिरि + भ्यां, and प्रियत्रि + भ्यां, here नुम् is superseded by the subsequent rule requiring आ and तिसृ respectively.\n\nIf this be so, then the employment of अच् in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of the supersession of नुम् by नुट् [[7.1.54]]. Thus नुट् has unrestricted scope in अग्नीनां, वायूनां, and नुम् has unrestricted scope in त्रपुणे and जतुने ॥ But in त्रपूणाम् and जतूनाम्, both नुट् and नुम् present themselves. Here however नुम् is superseded by नुट् by <i>purva</i>-<i>vipratishedha</i> and so there is lengthening of the vowel by [[6.4.3]]. This supersession is indicated by the employment of अच्, for नुट् and नुम् being both <i>anitya</i> and of equal force, had there been no अच्, नुम् would have come and not नुट् ॥\n\nBut this is also not valid, for नुट् would have to be added, even if there had been no अच् in the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThe employment of अच् is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.75]]. The only object that अच् serves in this <i>sutra</i>, is in forming the vocative हे त्रपो as shown above.",

This is equal to तुद् + अ + अत् + ई = तुदती the अ + अ becoming अ by the rule of पररूप <i>ekadesa</i> [[6.1.97]]. This <i>ekadesa</i> operation being <i>antaranga</i>, now there is no शतृ affix coming after a stem ending in अ, and therefore this <i>sutra</i> will not apply. If you say the <i>ekadesa</i> will be considered as the final of तुद् by [[6.1.85]], we reply, that the <i>antachvadbhava</i> of that <i>sutra</i> will not apply when simultaneous operations are to be performed, for अ cannot be said at one and the same time as the final of तुद् and the beginning of अन् (शतृ). If you say the maxim सांप्रतिकाभावे भूतपूर्व गतिः (when a word cannot denote something which actually is what is expressed by the word, it must be understood to denote something which formerly was what is expressed by it), will apply here, and that तुद् will be considered to end in अ because it formerly did end in the affix अ of श; we reply that then the present rule should apply to forms like अदती घ्नती &c. For here also we have अद् + शप् लोप + शतृ + ङीप्; and अद् should be considered to end in अ, because it had the affix शप् after it, though it was afterwards elided. The maxim quoted, therefore, proves too much.\n\nTo solve these objections, some say, that the word शतृ in this <i>sutra</i> means 'a portion of the affix शतृ, such as त्' and the <i>sutra</i> means 'after a stem ending in अ, to the portion त् of the affix शतृ there is added नुम्.' Others say, the word आत् in the <i>sutra</i> qualifies शी and नदी and not शतृ; and the <i>sutra</i> means \"नुम् is added to a stem ending in शतृ, when शी or नदी affixes follow after a stem ending in अ.\" Therefore in तुदती the affix ई is considered to come after the अ of तुद, the intervening त् not debarring it.\n\nWhy do we say \"after अ\"?

Thus क्रोष्ट्री꣡, क्रोष्ट्री꣡भ्याम्, क्रोष्ट्रीभिः ॥ Some read the word क्रोष्टु in the <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.41]], and they treat it is a तृच् ending word before the feminine affix ङीष्, as क्रोष्ट्रा ॥ According to them, in forming the <i>Taddhitartha</i> compounds like पञ्चभिः क्रोष्ट्रीभिः क्रीतैः = पञ्चक्रोष्टृभी रथैः, we could not get the form पञ्चक्रोष्टृभिः, because when the affix ठक् is elided by [[5.1.28]], the feminine is also elided by [[1.2.49]], and the ङीष् being thus <i>luk</i>-elided, there would be no तृज्वद्भाव, because the affix leaves no trace behind [[1.1.63]]. To get out of the difficulty, we can only say, that the form is so, in spite of the apparent inconsistency.\n\nThose who do not read क्रोष्टु in the <i>Gauradi</i> class, they explain this <i>sutra</i> by saying that the word स्त्रियां indicates the sense, namely, क्रोष्टु is treated like a तृच् word, when it denotes a female, wherever it may occur.\n\nAnd because क्रोष्टु is treated as if it was क्रोष्टृ, the feminine will be formed by the affix ङीप् by [[4.1.5]], and the form क्रोष्ट्री꣡ will be end-acute by [[6.1.174]]. So that whether क्रोष्ट्री be formed by ङीष् under <i>Gauradi</i> class, or by ङीप् under [[4.1.5]], the accent remains the same: while under this second view, we have not to face any such difficulty as in the first.",

Thus the Dative of the Neuter noun प्रियक्रोष्टु will be प्रियक्रोष्टुनेऽरण्याय, हितक्रोष्टुने वृषलकुलाय, and not क्रोष्ट्रे ॥ Similarly with नुट्, as क्रोष्टूनाम् ॥",
    "71098": "Thus चत्वा꣡रः, अनड्वा꣡न्, अनड्वा꣡हौ, अनड्वा꣡हः, अनड्वा꣡हम् ॥ The rule applies to compounds ending with चत्वार् and अनडुह्, as प्रियचत्वार्, प्रियचत्वारौ, प्रियचत्वारः, प्रियानड्वान्, प्रियानड्वाहौ, प्रियानड्वाहः ॥\n\nVart:- In the case of अनडुह् there is option in the feminine, as, अनडुही, or अनड्वाही ॥ This would be so, because it occurs in <i>Gauradi</i> class (IV. I. 41).",

The rule applies when the dento-labial व precedes: as वुवूर्षति ऋत्विजम् from वॄ; so also प्रावुवूर्षति कम्बलम् ॥ The labial consonant must be the consonant of the root. Therefore when ॠ 'to go' is preceded by सम्, the rule will not apply, for म् is not part of the root: as समीर्णम् by [[7.1.100]].\n\nVart:- The <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i> do take place in supersession of इर् and उर् substitution. Thus आस्तरणम् and आस्तारकः (from स्तॄ with ल्युट् and ण्वुल्), निपरणम्, निपारकः from पॄ, निगरणम्, निगारकः from गॄ ॥",
    "71103": "That is, it takes place even when the preceding letter is not labial, and does not take place even when the letter is labial.

    "72001": "The word इक् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> by virtue of [[1.1.3]]. As अचैषीत्, अनैषीत्, अलावीत्, अपावीत्, अकार्षीत्, अहार्षीत् [[7.3.96]] and [[8.2.28]] The <i>antaranga</i> <i>guna</i> substitution is superseded by the express mention of <i>Vriddhi</i>. If the <i>antaranga</i> <i>guna</i> is superseded by this <i>vriddhi</i>, why is not the <i>antaranga</i> उवङ् also superseded in न्यनुवीत्, न्यधुषीत् ? The <i>Vriddhi</i> does not take place, as these roots belong to कुटादि class, after which this affix is ङित् [[1.2.1]]. The <i>Vriddhi</i> being thus superseded, we have उवङ् substitution. Why do we say in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>? Observe अच्योष्ठ, अप्लोष्ट ॥",
    "72002": "As क्षर्-अक्षारीत्, त्सर्-अत्सारीत्, ज्वल्-अज्यालीत्, ह्मल्-अह्मालीत् ॥ This debars the option of [[7.2.7]]. Why 'short अ'? Observe न्यखारीत् न्यमीलीत् ॥ Why do we say \"ending in  र or ल\"? Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् ॥ The word अन्त means here 'proximity', as in the sentence उदकान्तं गतः = उदकसमीपं गतः ॥ The अ must be in the proximity of the र and ल ॥ Therefore the rule does not apply to अवभ्रीत्, अश्वल्लीत्, for though र and ल are here final of the stem, yet are not in the proximity of अ ॥",
    "72003": "As अवादीत्, अव्राजीत् ॥ This debars the option in the case of these two roots, which would have otherwise obtained by [[7.2.7]]. So also of stems ending in consonants: as अपाक्षीत्, अभैत्सीत्, अच्छैत्सीत्, अरौत्सीत् ॥ By the splitting up of the <i>sutra</i> (<i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>) these forms could be evolved without using the word हलन्त in the <i>sutra</i>. Thus (1) वदिव्रज्योः \"In the room of the अ of वद and व्रज् there is <i>Vriddhi</i>\", (2) अचः \"In the room of the vowel of the stem there is <i>Vriddhi</i>\". The word \"stem\" is understood throughout these chapters. If the vowel be at the end of the stem, there would be <i>Vriddhi</i> by (VII. 2. I), and if in the middle of the stem, then the verb ends with a consonant, and still there will be <i>Vriddhi</i> by our rule. The use of the word हलन्त in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the rule applies when more than one consonant even is at the end : as अराङ्क्षीत्, अभाङ्क्षीत् ॥\n\nHad the word हलन्तस्य not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the following maxim would have applied \"येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्\" ॥ The rule would have applied where only one consonant intervened between the vowel and the affix, but not when more than one consonant intervened. But it is intended that the rule should apply to such cases also.\n\nThe form उदवोढाम् is thus evolved. To the root वह् we add सिच् in the second Person singular. Thus वह् + स्ताम् ॥ Now there appears the <i>Vriddhi</i> rule on the one side; and the rule requiring the change of ह to ढ [[8.2.31]] the rule requiring the elision of स् [[8.2.26]], the rule requiring the change of त into ध [[8.2.40]], then the rule requiring the change of घ into ढ, and then the elision of one ढ [[8.3.13]] on the other. What rule is to be applied first-the <i>Vriddhi</i> or the other rules? The <i>Vriddhi</i> rule is to be applied first, because the other rules are considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]]: and after that we apply the other rules : and afterwards on account of the elision of ढ, we change the <i>Vriddhi</i> आ into ओ [[6.3.112]]. The equation will be something like this:- वह् + स्ताम् = वाह् + स्ताम् [[7.2.3]] = वाढ् + स्ताम्  [[8.2.31]] = वाढ् + ताम् [[8.2.26]] = वाढ् + धाम् [[8.2.80]] = वाह् + ढाम् [[8.4.41]] = वा + ढाम् [[8.3.13]] = वोढाम् [[6.3.112]]. This with the <i>upasarga</i> उत् and the augment अ becomes उदवोढाम् ॥ Similar is the evolution of उदवोढम् with स्तम् ॥ Once the अ has been <i>Vriddhied</i> into आ, there is no <i>Vriddhi</i> of ओ ॥ Had we not first <i>Vriddhied</i> the वह् into वाह्, but applied the <i>vriddhi</i> rule last, then there would have been <i>vriddhi</i> of ओ, as वौढाम् which is wrong. In fact where there has not taken place <i>vriddhi</i> first, there ओ is <i>vriddhied</i>, as = सोढामित्रस्यापत्यं = सौढामित्रिः ॥",

No, though <i>Guna</i> is <i>antaranga</i>, it is superseded by the express <i>Vriddhi</i>.",

This is an exception to [[7.1.7]] : so far as stems in ह्, य् and म् are concerned. There is no option allowed here. In the case of जागृ, णि roots, and श्वि, the <i>Vriddhi</i> would have taken place by (VII. I. 1) and (VII. I. 4), could not have debarred <i>Vriddhi</i>, hence the special mention of these roots.\n\nNor can it be said, in the case of these roots, that \"they will take first <i>guna</i>, on account of its being an <i>Antaranga</i> operation\", because, then the rule of <i>Vriddhi</i> ordained by (VII. I. I) will find no scope. Moreover, if the <i>guna</i> took place first and then <i>Vriddhi</i>, the mention of णि-roots and श्वि in the <i>sutra</i> would be redundant. For in ऊनयीत् and अश्वयीत्, having gunated the roots ऊनि and श्वि to ऊने and श्वे, and then substituting अय् (which is also <i>antaranga</i> ) for ए before ईत्, we have ऊनय् + ईत्, and श्वय् + ईत् ॥ Now these are roots which end in य् and would be covered by the first portion of the present <i>sutra</i>, viz, \"<i>h</i>-<i>m</i> <i>y</i>-<i>anta</i>\", so the especial mention of णि-roots and श्वि would be superfluous, if <i>guna</i> was to take place first. The very mention of णि-roots and श्वि in this <i>sutra</i>, is a <i>jnapaka</i> (indicator) of the following maxim न सिचि अन्तरङ्गमस्ति ॥\n\nWhy have we used the root जागृ in the <i>sutra</i>, when the special <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.85]] will cause <i>guna</i> by superseding <i>Vriddhi</i> in the case of जागृ? This supersession will take place on the analogy of अचोऽञ्णिति [[7.2.115]]; for as this <i>vriddhi</i> rule [[7.2.115]] is superseded by [[7.3.85]], so will the present <i>Vriddhi</i> rule [[7.2.1]]. Ans. No, this is not so. No doubt [[7.3.85]] does supersede the <i>vriddhi</i> rule [[7.2.1]] and we have <i>guna</i>, as जागर् + ईत् ॥ Then comes in [[7.2.2]], which would cause <i>vriddhi</i>, because now it is a root ending in र; this second <i>Vriddhi</i> is prohibited by the present <i>sutra</i>. You can say, that by the very fact that the <i>guna</i> rule [[7.3.85]] takes effect, will prevent every future <i>Vriddhi</i>, as in जागरयति  there is no penultimate <i>vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.116]] [जागृ + णि = जागर् + णि [[7.3.85]] = जागरि the rule [[7.2.116]] does not apply after <i>guna</i>] You can, of course, say so, and there is no answer to this but by saying that the mention of जागृ is only for the sake of distinctiess.\n\nIn case the reading of जागृ in the <i>sutra</i> be held necessary, then the operations which it undergoes, are shown below:\n\nजागृ + इस् + ईत् ॥ Now appears (1) the rule [[6.1.77]]. requiring the change of ॠ into र ॥ (2) This यणादेश is however, debarred by the rule [[7.3.84]] which causes <i>guna</i> of the finals of verbal stems before all <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes, because this <i>guna</i> rule is an <i>apavada</i> to यणादेश ॥ (3) But this <i>guna</i> in its turn is debarred by the rule (VII. 2. I) requiring the <i>vriddhi</i>. (4) But this <i>vriddhi</i> is, however, superseded by [[7.3.85]], which causes the <i>guna</i> of the final of जागृ ॥ Now having gunated it, we get this form :\n\nजागर् + इस् + ईत् ॥ Now appears [[7.2.3]] which requires <i>vriddhi</i>, because it is a root ending in a consonant. (2) But that <i>vriddhi</i> is superseded by [[7.2.4]] because the affix सिच् has taken the इट् augment. (3) Then appears the rule [[7.2.7]] requiring optional <i>vriddhi</i>, (4) But that optional <i>vriddhi</i> is superseded by the compulsory <i>vriddhi</i> requirred by [[7.2.2]], because it is a root ending in र ॥ (5) And this last <i>vriddhi</i> is prohibited by the present <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.5]]. These nine stages through which the form अजागरीत् is evolved, is abbreviated in the following mnemonic verse :- गुणो वृद्धिर्गुणो वृद्धिः प्रतिषेधो विकल्पमम् ॥ पुनर्वृद्धिर्निषेधोऽतो यण्पूर्वाः प्राप्तयो नव ॥",
    "72006": "As प्रौर्णावीत् or प्रौर्णवीत् ॥ This option applies when the सिच् is not treated as ङित् ॥ But after ऊर्णु, सिच् is optionally ङित्, [[1.2.6]]: when it is ङित्, there being neither <i>guna</i> nor <i>vriddhi</i>; we have उवङ् substitution, as प्रौर्णुवीत् [[6.4.77]].",
    "72007": "Thus अकणीत् or अकाणीत्, अरणीत् or अराणीत् ॥ Why do we say 'of अ' ? Observe अदेवीत्, असेवीत् ॥ Besides this patent objection, there is another, not so manifest. If we had not taken अतः, the <i>sutra</i> would have ordained <i>Vriddhi</i> of every vowel (अचः [[7.2.3]]), the <i>Vriddhi</i> so ordained would be an अच् pertaining <i>Vriddhi</i>, and not an इक्-pertaining <i>Vriddhi</i>. Therefore ङित् affixes will not debar such <i>Vriddhi</i>, for the क्ङिति च [[1.1.5]], debars only इग्लक्षणा <i>Vriddhi</i>. Therefore कुटादि roots after which सिच् is ङित् [[1.2.1]], will get <i>Vriddhi</i>, which is not desired. Therefore we have only one form of न्यकुटीत्, न्यपुटीत् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् from अश् and अट् ॥ Why do we say 'prosodially short'? Observe अतक्षीत्, अरक्षीत् ॥\n\nBut why does not <i>vriddhi</i> take place in अचकासीत् from the root चकास् (Ad. 65) ? The <i>vriddhi</i> does not take place on the maxim येन ना व्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्; for the rule applies to short अ only when a consonant intervenes between it and the affix, and not when both consonants and vowels intervene. In चकास् not only the consonants क् and स् intervene but also the vowel आ ॥ Hence there is no <i>vriddhi</i>. Moreover, the व्यवधान can be by one letter and not by more than one letter. Therefore, applying this maxim, the word लंघाः might have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i> without any detriment. In that case, the form अतक्षीत् from the root तक्ष (<i>Bhu</i> 685) will be explained by saying that rule [[7.2.7]] does not apply to it, because two consonants intervene between अ and the affix. In this view of the case, the employment of the word लघोः in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of distinctness only.\n\nThe word इट् is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the rule applies to सेट् aorist. The rule therefore, does not apply to <i>Anit</i> aorist, as अपाक्षीत् ॥\n\nThe form अपिपठिषीत् the aorist of the Desiderative root, is explained by saying that the long आ of <i>vriddhi</i> is elided by [[6.4.64]].",
    "72008": "The वश् <i>pratayahara</i> is rather vague. The rule really applies to <i>Krit</i> affixes beginning with व, र (ल) म and न, and no कृत् affix begins with any other letter of वश् class. Thus ईशिता, इशितुम् non-<i>vas</i> letters get the augment, but not ईश्वरः, [[3.2.175]] so also दीपिता, दीपितुम् but not दीप्रम् [[3.2.167]] (र्) भसिता, भसितुम् but not भस्म, [[3.2.75]].(मनिन्) यतिता, यतितुम् but not यत्नः [[3.3.90]] (नङ्) The <i>Vartika</i> नेड् वरमनादौ कृति gives the rule in a more definite form. Of course, in the <i>Unadi</i> <i>Krit</i>-affixes, there is diversity. There we get the affix ड, for example, which of course does not take the augment, as दम् + ड = दण्डः (<i>Unadi</i> I. 113). Why do we say कृत् affixes? Observe रुदिव, रुदिम ॥\n\nHere by [[7.2.76]] the <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes beginning with a वल् consonant take इट् augment after the roots रुद् &c; but this इट् will also be prohibited by the present <i>sutra</i>, if the word कृति be not read in the <i>sutra</i>. So that rule [[7.2.76]] would find scope before those affixes वलादि only which do not begin with a वश् letter; as रुदितः ॥ In some texts of <i>Kasika</i> the counter-example is रुरुदिम in the Perfect. This is wrong, according to <i>Padamanjari</i> (क्रादिनियमादेव इटः सिद्धत्वात्) because इट् always comes in the Perfect except after the root कृ &c. [[7.2.13]]: so the counter-example from the Perfect Tense is not valid. This <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[7.2.35]]. The <i>Krit</i>-affixes beginning with वश् letters as given by <i>Panini</i> are the following: वन् (वनिप्, क्वनिप्, ङवनिप्), वर (वरच and क्वरप्), वस् (क्वसु), रु (क्रु), लुक् (क्लुकन्), मन् (मनिन्), मर (क्मरच्) न (नङ्, मन्), नज् (नजिङ्), नु (क्नु) ॥ This list will show the truth of the above <i>vartika</i>.",

IV. 27), as शयिता, उड्डयिता ॥\n\n(6) All roots in long ऊ are सेट्, as लविता, पविता from लृ and पू ॥\n\n(7) All monosyllabic roots in short उ are <i>Anit</i>, except, रुङ् 'to sound' (II. 24, I. 1008), स्नु 'to flow' (II. 29), क्षु 'to sound' (II. 27), यु 'to mix' (II. 23) नु 'to praise' (II. 26), क्ष्णु 'to sharpen', (II. 28); and ऊर्णूञ् 'to cover' (II. 30, though consisting of more than one syllable, is treated like नु for the purposes of यङ्) ॥ Thus रविता, प्रस्रविता, क्षविता, यविता, नविता, क्ष्णविता and प्रोर्णविता ॥  \n\nOf the roots ending in consonants, all are सेट् except the following :-\n\n<i>Karika</i>:-\n\nइति स्वरान्ता निपुणैः समुच्चितास्ततो हलन्तानपि सन्निबोधत ।\nशकिस्तु कान्तेष्वनिडेक इष्यते घसिश्च सान्तेषु वसिः प्रसारणी॥\nरभिस्तु भान्तेष्वथ मैथुने यभिस्ततस्तृतीयोलभिरेवनेतरे ॥\n यमिर्यमन्तेष्वनिडेक इष्यते रमिश्च यश्च श्यनि पठ्यते मनिः ।\n नमिश्चतुर्थो हनिरेव पञ्चमो गमिश्च षष्ठः प्रतिषेधवाचिनाम् ॥ दिहिर्दुहिर्मेहतिरोहती वहिर्नहिस्तु षष्ठो दहतिस्तथा लिहिः ।\nइमेऽनिटोष्टायिह मुक्तसंशया गणेषु हान्ताः प्रविभज्य कीर्त्तिताः ॥\nदिशिं द्रशिं दंशिमथो मृशिं स्पृशिं रिशिं रुशिं क्रोशतिमष्टमं विशिम् ।\nलिशं च शान्ताननिटः पुराणगाः पठन्ति पाठेषु दशैव नेतरान् ॥\nरुधिः सराधिर्युधिबन्धिसाधयः क्रुधिक्षुधी शुध्यतिबुध्यतो व्यधिः ।\nइमे तु धान्ता दश येऽनिटो मतास्ततः परं सिद्ध्यतिरेव नेतरे ॥\nशिषिं पिषिं शुष्यति पुष्यती त्विषिं विषिं श्लिषिं तुष्यतिदुष्यती द्विषिम् ।\nइमान्दशैवोपविशन्त्यनिड्विधौ गणेषु षान्तान्कृषिकर्षती तथा ॥\nतपिं तिपिं चापिमयो वपिं स्वपिं लिपिं लुपिं तृप्यति दृप्यती सृपिम् ।\nस्वरेण नीचेन शपिं छुपिं क्षिपिं प्रतीहि पान्तान्पठितांस्त्रयोदश ॥\nआदिं हदिं स्कन्दिभिदिच्छिदिक्षुदीन् शदिं सदिं स्विद्यतिपद्यती खिदिम् ।\nतुदिं नुदिं विद्यतिविन्त इत्यपि प्रतीहि दान्तान्दश पञ्च चानिटः ॥\nपचिं वचिं विचिरिचिरञ्जपृच्छतीन् निचिं सिचि मुचिभजिभञ्जिभृज्जतीन् ।\nत्यजिं यजिं युजिरुजिसञ्जिमज्जतीन् भुजिं स्वजिंसृजिमृजी विद्धषनिट्स्वरान् ॥\n\n(1) क - शक् 'to be able' (IV. 78, V. 15). शक्ता, शक्ष्यति\n\n(2.) स् - घस् 'to eat' (I. 747, and also substitute of अद्), as, घस्ता; वस् 'to dwell' [[1.1.54]], as वस्ता ॥ The वस् which takes <i>Samprasarana</i> by (VI. I. 15), is meant here, and not वस् 'to cover' (II. 13), which does not vocalise, as वसिता वस्त्राणाम्, but उषितः from वस 'to dwell' [[7.2.52]].\n\n(3.) भ् - Three roots : रभ् 'to desire' [[1.1.23]], as, आरब्धा, यभ् coire [[1.1.29]], यब्धा, लभ् 'to take' [[1.1.24]], लब्धा ॥\n\n(4.) म् - Four roots, यम् 'to cease' [[1.1.33]], यन्ता; रम् 'to play' [[1.9.6]] रन्ता, नम् 'to bow'. (I.867, 1030) नन्ता, गम्लृ 'to go' [[1.1.31]] गन्ता ॥\n\n(5). न् - Two roots मन् 'to think' (IV. 67), मन्ता, हन् 'to kill' (II. 2), हन्ता ॥ The <i>Divadi</i> मन् should be taken, otherwise मनिता from मन् - मनुते (VIII. 9). \n\n(6.) ह् - Eight roots :- दिह् 'to smear' (II. 5), देग्धा; दुह् 'to milk' (II. 4), दोग्धा; मिह् 'to sprinkle' [[1.1.41]] मीढा, रुह् 'to grow' [[1.9.2]] रोढा; वह् 'to carry' [[1.1.53]] वोढा, नह् 'to bind' (IV. 57) नद्धा; दह् 'to burn' [[1.1.41]] दग्धा, लिह् 'to lick' (II. 6) लेढा ॥ In other collections सह् (I. 905, IV. 20), मुह् (IV. 89), रिह (VI. 23), लुह् (?), are also enumerated; of these सह् takes इट् optionally before affixes beginning with त, so also मुह् because it belongs to the class of रधादि [[7.2.45]] the other two are not found (?) in root-collections, hence the <i>Karika</i> uses the words मुक्तसंशयः ॥\n\n(7.) श् - Ten roots :- दिश् 'to show' (VI. 3), दृश् 'to see' [[1.1.37]], दश् 'to bite' [[1.1.38]], मृश् 'to rub' [[6.1.1]], स्पृश् 'to touch' (VI. I28), रिश [[6.1.6]], रुश् [[6.1.6]] both meaning 'to hurt', विश् 'to enter'[[6.1.0]], लिश् 'to be small' (IV. 70, VI. 127). As वेष्टा, द्रष्टा, दंष्टा, आम्रष्टा or आमर्ष्टा, स्पर्ष्टा or स्प्रष्टा, The roots with a penultimate ॠ short, which are <i>anudatta</i> in the <i>dhatupatha</i>, with the exception of मृज् and दृश्, take optionally the augment रम् (VI. I. 59), ॥ रष्टो, रोष्टा, क्रोष्टा, प्रवेष्टा, लेष्टा ॥\n\n(8.) ध् - Ten roots:- रुध् with अनु, 'to love'. रुध् 'to obstruct' (IV. 65) रोद्धा, राध् 'to accomplish' (IV. 71, V. 16) राद्धा; युध् 'to fight' (IV. 64) योद्धा; बन्ध् 'to bind' (1. 1022), बन्द्धा; साध् 'to accomplish' (V. 17) साद्धा; क्रुध् 'to be angry' (IV. 80) क्रोद्धा, क्षुध् 'to be hungry' (IV. 81) क्षोद्धा; शुध् 'to be pure' (IV. 82) शोद्धा, बुध् 'to be aware' (IV. 63); बोद्धा; ष्यध् 'to pierce' ( IV. 72) ष्यद्धा; सिध् 'to be accomplished' (IV. 83) सेद्धा ॥ The roots बुध् and सिध् are exhibited in the above <i>Karika</i> with श्यण् <i>vikarana</i> (बुद्ध्यति, सिद्ध्यति); therefore बुध् and सिध् take इट् in other <i>ganas</i> than the Fourth; as बोधिता and सेधिता ॥ There being want of prohibition with regard to निष्ठा, we have बुधितं and सिधितं ॥\n\n(9.) ष् - roots. Ten. शिष् 'to distinguish' (VII, 14) शेष्टा; पिष् 'to pound' (VII. 15) पेष्टा, शुष् 'to become dry' (IV. 74) शोष्टा; पुष् 'to be nourished' (IV. 73), पोष्टा, त्विष् 'to shine' [[1.1.50]] त्वेष्टा, विष् 'to pervade, to sprinkle' (I. 729, III. 13, IX. 54) वेष्टा, श्लिष् 'to embrace' (I. 734. IV. 77) श्लेष्टा; तुष् 'to be satisfied' (IV. 75) तोष्टा, दुष् 'to be sinful' (IV. 76) दोष्टा, दोक्ष्यति, द्विष् 'to hate' (II. 3) द्वेष्टा, द्वेक्ष्यति, कृष् 'to  draw' (I. 1059, VI. 6 both <i>Bhuadi</i> and <i>Tudadi</i> are taken, as the <i>karika</i> uses the two forms), आक्रष्टा and आकर्ष्टा ॥\n\n(10.) प् Thirteen roots : तप् 'to burn' (1. 1034, IV. 51) तप्ता, तप्स्यति, तिप् 'to distil' [[1.3.5]] तेप्ता, आप् 'to obtain' (V 14, X. 295) आप्ता; वप् 'to sow' [[1.1.52]] वप्ता; स्वप् 'to sleep' (II. 59) स्वप्ता; लिप् 'to anoint' [[6.1.9]] लेप्ता; लुप् [[6.1.7]] 'to break', लोप्ता ॥ The roots तृप् and वृप् optionally take इट्, as they belong to रधादि class (VII. 2. 45, <i>Divadi</i> 84 - 91). The special mention of these two roots in the <i>karika</i>, is for the sake of indicating that these roots take अम् augment; as त्रप्ता or तर्प्ता, or तर्पिता; द्रप्ता, or दर्प्ता or दर्पिता ॥ The तृप् and दृप् belonging to <i>Tudadi</i> class, are <i>Udatta</i> and सेट् ॥ सृप् [[1.1.32]] 'to creep' स्रप्ता, सर्प्ता; शप् 'to curse (1. 1049) शप्ता; छुप् 'to touch' [[6.1.5]] छोप्ता; क्षिप् 'to throw' (IV. 14) क्षेप्ता ॥\n\n(11.) द - Fifteen roots. अद् 'to eat' [II. I] अत्ता; हद् 'to void excrement' [[1.1.26]] हत्ता; स्कन्द् 'to leap' [[1.1.28]] स्कन्ता; भिद् 'to break' (VII. 2) भेत्ता, छिद् 'to cut' (VII. 3) छेत्ता; क्षुद् 'to pound' (VII. 6) क्षोत्ता, क्षोत्स्यति, शद् 'to perish' (I. 908, VI. 134), शत्ता, सद् 'to sink' (I. 907, VI. 133) सत्ता, स्विद् 'to sweat' (IV. 79) स्वेत्ता ॥ The root is exhibited as स्विद्ध्यति in the above <i>karika</i>, showing that the Fourth class root is to be taken, and not the <i>Bhuadi</i> (1. 780), which is <i>udatta</i> and takes इट् ॥ पद् 'to go' (IV. 60), पत्ता; खिद् 'to be troubled' (IV. 61, VI. 142, VII. 12) खेत्ता, तुद् 'to strike' (VI. 1) तोत्ता; नुद् 'to impel' (VI. 2) नोत्ता; विद् (IV. 62)  वेत्ता ॥ The root विद् is exhibited in the <i>karika</i>, as विद्यति and विन्त, therefore, the rule applies to दिवादि and क्र्यादि विद् ॥ The <i>Adadi</i> (वेत्ति) and <i>Tudadi</i> (विन्दति) विद् is सेट् as वेदिता विद्यानाम्, वेदिताधनस्य ॥\n\n(12.) च् - six roots :- पच् 'to cook' [[1.1.7]] पक्ता, पक्ष्यति; वच् 'to speak' (II. 54) वक्ता, विच् 'to separate' (VII. 5) विवेक्ता; रिच् 'to make empty' (VII. 4) रेक्ता; सिच् 'to sprinkle' [[6.1.0]] सेक्ता; मुच् [[6.1.6]] 'to loose' मोक्ता ॥\n\n(13.) छ् - One root प्रछ् 'to ask' [[6.1.0]] प्रष्टा, प्रक्ष्यति ॥\n\n(14.) ज् - Fifteen roots :- रञ्ज् 'to colour' (I. 865. 1048) रङ्क्ता; निज् 'to cleanse' (II. II) निर्णेक्ता, नेक्ष्यति; भज् 'to honor' [[1.1.47]] भक्ता; भञ्ज् 'to break' (VII. 16) भङ्क्ता; भृञ्ज् 'to fry' [[1.1.1]] भ्रष्टा or भर्ष्टा; त्यज् 'to quit' [[1.1.35]] त्यक्ता; यज् 'to sacrifice' [[1.1.51]] यष्टा, युज् 'to join' (IV. 68, VII. 7) योक्ता; रुज् 'to break' [[6.1.3]] रोक्ता; सञ्ज् 'to adhere' [[1.1.36]] सङ्क्ता, मञ्ज 'to be immersed' [[6.1.2]] मङ्क्ता; भुज् 'to bend' [[6.1.4]] 'to enjoy' (VII. 17). भोक्ता, स्वज् 'to embrace' [[1.1.25]] परि-ष्वक्ता; सृज 'to emit' 'to create' (IV. 69, VI. 121) स्रष्टा; मज् 'to cleanse' (I. 269, II. 57), मार्ष्टा, मर्जिता ॥ The root मृज् is exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with a long indicatory ऊ, e-s, मृजू शुद्धौ (II. 57). It, therefore, optionally would take इट् ॥ Nor does this root take अम् augment. The inclusion of this root in the above list is, therefore, questionable. Others read विज instead of मृज ॥ The निजादि root विज is <i>Anit</i> (III. 12) i. e. विज् 'to separate' the विज् of <i>Rudhadi</i> takes इट् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"a monosyllabic root\"? Observe अवधीत् ॥ The root is taught as वध with a final अ [[2.4.42]] in order to prevent <i>vriddhi</i>. Why do we say \"in <i>upadesa</i> or <i>Dhatupatha</i>\"?\n\nThe rule will not apply to roots which have become <i>anudatta</i> during evolution i. e. when taking affixes. Therefore, we have पचिष्यति and लविष्यति with इट्, but not here, कर्ता कटान, कर्त्तुम् ॥",
    "72011": "<i>Karika</i>  \n\nवाच्य ऊर्णोर्नुवद्भावो यङ्प्रसिद्धिः प्रयोजनम् ।\nआमश्च प्रतिषेधार्थमेकाचश्चेडुपग्रहात् ॥\n\nAs श्रित्वा, श्रितः, श्रितवान् ॥ So also with roots ending in उक् vowels : as युत्वा, युतः, युतवान्; लूत्वा, लूनः, लूनवान्; वृत्वा, वृतः, वृतवान्; तीर्त्वा, तीर्णः, तीर्णवान् ॥\n\nWhy 'श्रि and उक् ending roots only'? Observe विदितः ॥ Why having an indicatory क्? Observe श्रयितृ, श्रयितुम्, श्रयितव्यम् ॥ Some read two क's in the <i>sutra</i> and would apply it to the indicatory ग् also, as भूष्णु [[3.2.139]].\n\nThis rule applies to those roots, which have not been enumerated above. In the case of यु the <i>Nishtha</i> will not take इट् even by [[7.2.49]] read with [[7.2.15]].\n\nWhen two क are read in the <i>sutra</i>, one standing for ग्; there arises a little difficulty of combination. Thus ग् coming after the <i>visarga</i> of उकः would require that the <i>visarga</i> be changed to उ by [[6.1.114]]. If ग् be changed to क् [[8.4.55]] then also, the <i>visarga</i> required to be changed into <i>upadhmaniya</i> by [[8.3.37]]. If the change of ग् into क् [[8.4.55]] be considered <i>asiddha</i> (VIII. 2. 1.), then also the <i>visarga</i> must be changed to उ [[6.1.114]], and the <i>sutra</i> should be श्र्युकोकिति ॥ This, however, is not done as an anomaly allowable in <i>sutra</i> construction. According to <i>Kasika</i>, this difficulty would not at all arise, if in the <i>sutra</i> ग्लाजिस्थश्चक्स्नु [[3.2.139]], the स्था + आ be taken as compounded into स्था; so that that rule would apply to that स्था which ends in आ, and not to that स्था whose final is changed to ई; so that the form स्थास्नुः is evolved without anomaly: and the affix will be कित् (क्स्नु) and not गित् (ग्स्नु). The affix being कित्, the above <i>sandhi</i> difficulty will not arise at all.\n\nThe word उपदेश is understood here also, so that the rule will apply to roots which end in उक् vowel, in their original states and not to the transformed base before the affix. Thus तॄ is a उक्-ending root, which is transformed to तीर् before the <i>Nishtha</i> त ॥ The rule will apply to it, as तीर्णः ॥ If you object saying, that तॄ  ends in long ॠ and its Desiderative optionally takes इट् by [[7.2.41]], and therefore, its <i>Nishtha</i> will always take no इट् by [[7.2.15]]. we reply, that the option taught in [[7.2.41]] applies to roots ending in long ॠ; but when the root vowel is changed to ई, it is no longer a ॠ-ending root. If you say, the rule of <i>sthanivad</i> <i>bhava</i> will apply: we say, that that rule is not applicable to अल् विधि, and this is an अल्विधि ॥ Therefore, the word उपदेश should be read into this <i>sutra</i>. If this be so, the rule ought to apply to जागृ, and we could not get the forms जागरितः and जागरितवान् ॥ To explain this we should also read the <i>anuvritti</i> of एकाच् into this <i>sutra</i>. The root ऊर्णु, however is an exception and is governed by this rule, in spite of its consisting of more than one vowel. Thus प्रोर्णुतः and प्रोर्णुतवान् ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- ऊर्णु is treated as if it was नु, when the affix यङ् is to be applied, आम् is to be prohibited, or इट् is to be debarred.",
    "72012": "As जिघृक्षति, जुघुक्षति, रुरूषति, लुलूषति ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of श्रि is not drawn into this <i>sutra</i>, as option is allowed regarding it by (VII 2. 49). ग्रह would always get इट्, गुह् (1. 944) being ऊदित् (in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>), would have optionally taken इट् [[7.2.44]]\n\nThe forms जिघृक्षति and जुघुक्षति are thus evolved :- ग्रह् + सम् (the affix is कित् by [[1.2.8]]) = गृह् + सन् (VI. I. 16) = गृढ् + सन् [[8.2.31]] = गृक् + सन् [[8.2.41]] = जिघृक्षति [[8.2.37]]. So also with गुहू संवरणे, the सन् is कित् here by [[1.2.10]].",
    "72013": "Thus कृ - चकृव, चकृम; सृ, ससृव, ससृम; भृ, बभृव, बभृम; वृञ्, ववृव, ववृम; वृङ्, ववृवहे, ववृमहे; स्तु, तुष्टुव, तुष्टुम; द्रु, दुद्रुव, दुद्रम; स्रु; सुस्रुव, सुस्रुम; श्रु; शुश्रुव, शुश्रुम ॥ सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थः, क्रादय एव लिट्यनिटस्ततोन्ये सेट इति ॥\n\nThese roots with the exception of वृ are <i>Anit</i> by rule [[7.2.10]]; their special mention here is for the sake of <i>niyama</i>, namely, these roots alone are <i>Anit</i> in the Perfect, other roots are all Set in the Perfect. Thus बिभिदिव, बिभिदिम, लुलुविव, लुलुविम ॥ All <i>anudatta</i> roots of the <i>Dhatupatha</i> are to be understood, by this rule, to get इट् ॥ The affix थ of the Perfect gets इट् after वृञ्, as the irregular form ववर्थ in [[7.2.64]], indicates that in the <i>Veda</i>, थ does not get इट् after वृञ्, but in the secular literature it does. By [[7.2.63]], the थ would have got इट् after स्तु, द्रु, स्रु and श्रु; that इट् is also prohibited by the present <i>sutra</i>. As तुष्टोथ, दुद्रोथ,\nस्रुस्रोथ, शुश्रोथ ॥\n\nVart:- इट् is added when कृ takes the सुट् augment : as संचस्करिव, संचस्करिम ॥ The rule [[7.2.63]], applies here also, as संचस्करिथ ॥",

So also दीपी (IV. 42), दीप्तः, दीप्तवान् ॥ In the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, डीङ् (IV. 27), is classed among ओदित् roots, and it indicates that the <i>Nishtha</i> is <i>anit</i> after it : and ओ is for न-change [[8.2.45]] as, उड्डीनः, उड्डीनवान् ॥ The word निष्ठायाम् governs the following <i>sutras</i> upto [[7.2.35]].",
    "72015": "That is, a root which is optionally Set, before other affixes, is invariably <i>anit</i> before <i>Nishtha</i>. Thus by [[7.2.44]], वल् consonant beginning affixes are optionally सेट् after the roots धू &c. The <i>Nishtha</i> after धू &c, will be invariably <i>anit</i>. Thus विधूतः, विधूतवान्; गूढः, गूढवान् ॥ By [[7.2.56]], the roots having an indicatory उ, optionally are followed by Set क्त्का ॥ The <i>Nishtha</i> after उदित् roots will invariably be <i>anit</i> : as वृद्धः, वृद्धवान् ॥\n\nBy the <i>vartika</i> तानि पदि दरिद्राणामुपसंख्यानम् the roots तन्, पत and दरिद्रा take optional इट् in the Desiderative [[7.2.49]].

According to <i>Padamanjari</i> this rule of यस्य विभाषा  is <i>anitya</i> and not of universal application. Because had this rule been of universal application then the root कृत which is optionally <i>anit</i> by [[7.2.57]], would universally <i>anit</i> by the present <i>sutra</i> : and there would be no necessity of reading it with a long ई in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, as कृती छेदने [[6.1.1]] to make its <i>nishtha</i> <i>anit</i> under [[7.2.14]].",
    "72016": "As ञिमिदा — मिम्नः, मिन्नवान्; ञिक्ष्विदा — क्ष्विण्णः — क्ष्विण्णवान्; ञिष्विदा — स्विम्नः, स्विन्नवान् ॥ The च implies that other roots not enumerated are to be also included, as आश्वस्तः, वान्तः ॥\n\nThis and the <i>sutra</i> following it could have been made into one, as आदितश्च विभाषा भावादिकर्मणोः ॥ The separate making of two <i>sutras</i> indicates that the rule of यस्य विभाषा [[7.2.15]], applies with the restrictions and limitations of the rule ordaining 'option', i.e., the prohibition of इट् augment, with regard to the participial-affixes is limited by the same conditions, which apply to the optional employment of इट् before other affixes in the विभाषा rules (यदुपाधेर्विभाषा, तदुपाधेः प्रतिषेधः) ॥ Thus [[7.2.68]] ordains इट् optionally to the affix वसु after the roots गम्, हन्, विद् and विश् ॥ The root विद् there is the <i>Tudadi</i> root meaning 'to acquire'. The rule यस्य विभाषा will apply to this विद् with this meaning : and not to विद् meaning 'to know', the Past Participles of which are विदितः, विदितवान् ॥",

    "72018": "When the words have not the above sense, we have 1. क्षुभितं 'disturbed or agitated'.

    "72019": "As धृष्टः, विशस्तः ॥ The root धृष् is exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as ञिधृषा 'to be impudent' [[5.2.2]], and as it has an indicatory आ, its past participle would be अनिट् by [[7.2.16]]. शस् is शसु in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (1.763), and as it has an indicatory उ by [[7.2.56]]. read with [[7.2.15]], its <i>Nishtha</i> is also <i>Anit</i>. The special mention of these roots here, is for the sake of making a <i>niyama</i> rule; namely, अनिट् only then when meaning 'impudent', and सेट् in other senses : as धर्षितः, विशसितः \"धृष् never forms past participle with the force of भाव (Impersonal action) or आदिकर्म (beginning of action), and therefore [[7.2.17]] cannot apply to it\" - <i>This is </i>Kasika<i>. According to </i>Bhattoji<i> </i>Dikshit<i> who quotes </i>Haradatta<i> and </i>Madhava_, धृष् forms participles in those senses, when option is allowed, as, धृष्टं or धर्षितं, प्रधृष्टः or प्रधर्षितः not meaning 'impudent'.",
    "72020": "It is derived from दृंह् with क्त affix. In other senses, the forms are दृंहितम् or दृहितम् ॥ There are two roots one दृह् (1.769) without nasal, and the other दृंह् (1.770) with the nasal. दृढ can be derived from any one of these by eliding ह, and the nasal, and changing त to ढ, and not adding the augment इट् ॥\n\nThe difference between स्थूल and बल is that a man may be stout or स्थूल without being strong (बलवान्) and vice versa. The word बल in the <i>sutra</i> is equal to बलवत्; in fact, the word बल is formed by अच् affix. The irregularity in the formation of दृढ consists in the absence of इट् and the elision of ह् (and of न्, if the root दृंह be taken) : and the change of त into ढ ॥ This irregular elision of ह is for the sake of preventing the application of the rule पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् [[8.2.1]]. The form could have been obtained in the regular way by the elision of ढ, thus : दृह् + त = दृढ् + त [[8.2.31]] = दृढ् + ध = दृढ् + ढ = दृ + ढ [[8.3.13]] = दृढ ॥ But then when ढ is elided, the rule पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् will apply, and the forms द्रढिमा, द्रढीयान्, द्रढयति could not be obtained. For ॠ is changed to र by [[6.4.161]] only when it is <i>laghu</i> or light, but ढ -<i>lopa</i> being considered <i>asiddha</i>, the ॠ would be heavy as standing before a conjunct consonant. So also the form परिदृढय्याऽगतः could not be obtained: for the णि would not be changed to अय् before ल्यप् when the ॠ is not light or <i>laghu</i> [[6.4.56]]. So also, परिदृढस्यापत्यं = परिदृढी (the daughter of <i>Paridrdha</i>) could not be formed. For ॠ being considered <i>guru</i> or heavy, the affix ष्यङ् would have come in the feminine [[4.1.78]].",
    "72021": "This is formed, like दृढ, from वृह् or वृंह् ॥ When not having the sense of 'Lord', we have परिवृहितम् and परिवृंहितम् ॥\n\nThe ह is elided first as an anomaly. By so doing we can get the forms like परिव्रढयति, परिव्रढय्यगतः; पारिवृढीकन्या ॥ The form परिव्रढय्य is formed by ल्यप् instead of <i>ktva</i> ॥ Though the full noun is परिवृढ and णिच् is added to such a noun, yet for the purposes of <i>ktva</i> it is considered as a compound verb, having परि as <i>upasarga</i>. In fact, णिच् is added to वृढ, and the root becomes व्रढि, and then <i>ktva</i> is added to this root, and then there is compounding of परि with this word ending in <i>ktva</i>, and then by the regular process the <i>ktva</i> is replaced by ल्यप् ॥ The general rule is that Derivative roots formed from nouns, like परिवृढ, उत्मनस्, सुमनस् &c which have an <i>upasarga</i> as one of their formative elements, are treated as if they were compound verbs having those <i>upasargas</i>. The result of this is, that though the full noun is सुमनस्, yet in the derivative verb, सु will be treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, as in ordinary compound verbs. Thus the augment अ in the Imperfect is added after सु and not before it, as स्वमनायत, उदमनायत ॥ The rule is उपसर्गसमानाकारं पूर्वपदं धातुसंज्ञाप्रयोजके प्रत्यये चिकीर्षिते पृथक् क्रियते ॥ The Participial form of these words is therefore with ल्यप् and not क्त्वा, as सुमनाय्य and उन्मनाय्य ॥ The only exception to this rule is the noun संग्राम, in which the <i>upasarga</i> सम् is not considered as a separate member in the Derivative verb. This being the general rule, in परिव्रढयति the portion परि is treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, and व्रढयति as the verb, and its accent is governed by तिङ्ङ तिङ् (VIII. I. 28) i. e. it becomes altogether unaccented and परि retains its accent. So also परिव्रढय्य, where is परि is compounded with the Participial form व्रढित्वा, and then त्वा is changed to ल्यप् by [[7.1.37]].",

The prohibition of विशब्दन in the <i>sutra</i>, indicates by <i>jnapaka</i> that the णिच् added to the root in the <i>Churadi</i> class in the sense of विशब्दन is <i>anitya</i>. So the following construction becomes valid:- as महीपालवचः श्रुत्वा जुघुषुः पुष्पमाणवाः \"expressed their opinions in words\".\n\nIn short the णिच् is optionally added to the घुषिर् of the <i>Churadi</i> class.\n\nSome say the <i>Churadi</i> णिच् is <i>anitya</i> generally and not only after घुषिर् (अनित्य ण्यन्ताश्चुरादयः) ॥ This is inferred from the mention of the root चिति स्मृत्याम् (X. 2) in this class. The indicatory इ in चिति shows that the augment इट् will be added to the root, which will thus become चिन्त and this न will be retained throughout and never dropped. (VII. I. 48). Now had the णिच् been <i>nitya</i>, then the root ought to have been taught as चिन्त स्मृत्याम्, because no rule would have caused the elision of the न् of चिन्त when णिच् was added. The enunciation of the root as चिति, therefore, indicates that the <i>churadi</i> णिच् is <i>anitya</i>, and thus we get the forms like, चिन्तितः, चिन्त्यात्, चिन्त्यते, चिन्तति, चिन्तेत् &c.",

The word लोम means the hair of the body as well as of the head : as in the sentence लोमनखं स्पृष्ट्वा शौचं कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The sense of हृष् in connection with लोम or will be that of bristling up, horipillation.

The employment of <i>ardhadhatuka</i> here can be dispensed with. Why before affixes beginning with a वल्-consonant? Observe लव्यम्, पव्यम्, लवनीयम्, पवनीयम् ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of इट् was understood here, its repetition is for the sake of preventing the prohibition of the foregoing <i>sutras</i> like [[7.2.8]].",
    "72036": "The roots स्नु and क्रम् are <i>udatta</i>, and will get इट् augment naturally, the <i>sutra</i> makes a restriction or <i>niyama</i>. The restriction is that when the roots themselves occasion <i>atmanepada</i> affixes, then they do not take इट्, otherwise they will.\n\nWhen do roots give occasion to <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes? The roots occasion <i>atmanepada</i> affixes when employed in the Impersonal, Passive, and Intensive senses. <i>Sutras</i> [[1.3.38]] — [[1.3.43]], teach us when क्रम takes <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. Thus प्रस्नविता, प्रस्नवितुम्, प्रस्नवितव्यम्, प्रक्रमिता, प्रक्रमितुम्, प्रक्रमितव्यम् ॥ Why do we say 'when not the occasion of getting the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes'? Observe, प्रस्नोषीष्ट, प्रक्रंसीष्ट, प्रस्नोष्यते, प्रक्रंस्यते, प्रस्नुषिष्यते, प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते ॥ In all these examples स्नु and क्रम् have become the causes of taking the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. The Desiderative is also <i>Atmanepadi</i> because of [[1.3.62]].\n\nWhy have we used the word निमित्त in the <i>sutra</i>? Would it not have been simpler to say स्नुक्रमोरमात्मनपदे ? This form of <i>sutra</i> would have indicated that whenever an <i>atmanepada</i> affix followed, then there would be no इट् augment. Now the rule is that all words exhibited in the Locative case in this Grammar, have the force of परसप्तमी, i. e. when that word follows. Therefore आत्मनेपदे would mean when an <i>atmanepada</i> affix followed. If then this \"<i>atmanepada</i>\" be taken as qualifying स्नु and क्रम्, then it must follow immediately after those roots, as in प्रस्नोषीष्ट and प्रक्रंसीष्ट; but we would not get the forms प्रस्नोष्यते and प्रक्रंस्यत, because स्य intervenes between the <i>atmanepada</i> and the affix. On the other hand if \"<i>atmanepada</i>\" be taken to qualify the word \"<i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix\" understood, viz, if the <i>sutra</i> meant स्नुक्रमिभ्यां परस्यार्धधातुकस्यात्मनेपदेऽनन्तरे then the forms प्रस्नोष्यते and प्रक्रंस्यते would be valid, but we should not get the forms प्रस्नोषीष्ट and प्रक्रंसीष्ट, because the augment सीयुट् is a portion of the <i>atmanepada</i> affix, and there is no <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix here. If the <i>sutra</i> be taken to have both the above senses, then we could not get the form प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते in the Desiderative, because here the <i>atmanepada</i> does not follow immediately after the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix that follows क्रम् ॥ Therefore, the word निमित्त should be taken. For by so doing, there takes place prohibition with regard to सीयुट् &c, and also with regard to that after which comes the <i>atmanepada</i>, as the स्य in प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते, and also with regard to that which precedes the latter, as the सन् affix in the above. In प्रस्नवित्रीयते (प्रस्नवितेवाचरति), the root स्नु has not occasioned the <i>atmanepada</i> affix, but the affix क्यङ्, hence the prohibition of this <i>sutra</i> does not apply.\n\nVart:- Prohibition of इट् augment should be stated with regard to क्रम् when an <i>Krit</i>-affix, with active force, follows not in the <i>atmanepada</i>, though in the Active voice such क्रम् was subject of <i>Atmanepada</i>. When क्रम् takes no <i>upasargas</i>, we have according to one view two forms क्रन्ता and क्रमिता [[1.3.43]] because the <i>atmanepada</i> here is optional. According to the other view there will be only one form, as क्रमिता  ॥ But with  प्र and उप् we have प्रक्रन्ता and उपक्रन्ता ॥ Why do we say 'the <i>Krit</i>-affix should have an active force'? Observe प्रक्रमितव्यम्, उपक्रमितव्यम् ॥ Why do we say \"when it was subject of <i>Atmanepada</i>\"? Observe निष्क्रमिता ॥ Here there is इट् augment ; for by [[1.3.42]], क्रम् is subject of <i>atmanepada</i>, when the <i>upasargas</i> प्र and उप precede, but not otherwise.\n\nWith regard to स्नु, it will take no इट् in the Desiderative, and before a कित् affix, by virtue of [[7.2.11]] and [[7.2.12]].

Compare [[7.2.36]] <i>vartika</i>.

He explains it by saying:- परस्मैपदेषु यो गमिरुपलक्षितस्तस्मात् सकारादेरार्धधातुकस्य इट् भवति ॥ According to him we have the forms संजिगंसिता and अधिजिगंसिता व्याकरणस्य ॥",
    "72059": "Thus वृत् — वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत्, विवृत्सति । वृध् वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत् । विवृत्स्सति । शृधू । शर्त्स्यति । अशर्त्स्यत् । शिशृत्सति । स्यन्दू । स्यन्त्सति । अस्यन्त्स्यत् ।\n\nThe वृतादि roots are four वृत्, वृध्, शृध् and स्यन्द (<i>Bhuadi</i> 795-798). In the examples, the <i>Parasmaipada</i> forms are shown, because these roots are optionally <i>Parasmaipadi</i> by [[1.3.92]] before स्य and सन् ॥\n\nObjection :- The word चतुर्भ्यः may conveniently have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i>. A reference to the <i>Dhatupatha</i> will show that the वृतादि roots form a subdivision of द्युतादि roots, and stand at the end of <i>Dyutadi</i> class. So that the <i>sutra</i> न वृद्भ्यः would have been enough, and there would have been no uncertainty or vagueness about it, for the word वृतादि would mean 'the roots वृत् &c. with which the <i>Dyutadi</i> class ends'. Thus we shall get the five roots 795 वृतुर्वर्तने 796 वृधु वृद्धौ, 797 शृधु शब्दकुत्सायाम्; 798 स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे and कृपू सामर्थ्ये ॥ As regards the last root कृपू, we shall find from the next <i>sutra</i>, that the present <i>sutra</i> applies to this root also. Or we can change the order of the roots, putting  कृपू first, and वृतु &c after it, so that वृतादि will mean four roots only. Whether <i>vritadi</i> be taken to mean the five or the four roots, the word चतुर्भ्यः is redundant.\n\nAns:- The word चतुर्भ्यः is used in order that the prohibition contained in this <i>sutra</i> may debar the 'option' which the root स्यन्दू would have taken, because of its indicatory long ऊ [[7.2.44]]. For this 'option' is an <i>antaranga</i> operation, because it applies to all <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes; while the 'prohibition' of the present <i>sutra</i> is a <i>bahiranga</i>, because it applies to those affixes only which begin with स ॥ So that the 'prohibition' of this <i>sutra</i> would not have debarred the 'option' of [[7.2.44]]: and in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> स्यन्दू would have had two forms; which, however, is not the case because of the word चतुर्भ्यः by which the 'prohibition' is extended to स्यन्दू also. Thus in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, we have only one form, as, स्यन्त्स्यति; but in the <i>Atmanepada</i> we have two forms स्यन्दिष्यते or स्यन्त्स्यते ॥\n\nThe word '<i>Parasmaipada</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the prohibition does not apply to <i>atmanepada</i> affixes: as वर्त्तिषीष्ट, वर्तिष्यते, अवर्तिष्यत्, विवर्तिष्यते, स्यन्दिषीष्ट or स्यन्त्सीष्ट ॥ Moreover, with regard to <i>Atmanepada</i> also, the इट् is added to these roots when they stand in the same '<i>pada</i>' with the affixes. But when the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes are added not to the roots '<i>vrit</i> &c', but to the roots which are derived from the nominal bases formed from '<i>vrit</i> &c', then the 'root' is not in the same <i>pada</i> with the affix, and the prohibition of this <i>sutra</i> will apply. As विवृत्सित्रीयते ॥ Moreover, the rule applies, as we have said, to the affixes standing in the same '<i>pada</i>' with the 'roots'; therefore it will apply to Desiderative roots, as विवृत्सति, though शप् here intervenes between the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix सन् and the <i>Parasmaipada</i> तिप्; so also, an <i>ekadesa</i> though <i>sthanivat</i> and therefore an intervention, will not be considered so for the purposes of this rule, as विवृत्सिष्यति; so also in विवृत्सयति ॥ This prohibition, moreover, applies to कृत् affixes, and where there is <i>luk</i>-elision of <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes. As विवृत्सिता; and विवृत्स त्वम् where the Imperative हि is <i>luk</i> elided, and being so elided, the force of <i>Parasmaipada</i> does not here remain by न लुमताङ्गस्य [[1.1.63]]; hence the above <i>Ishti</i>.",
    "72060": "Thus कल्प्ता, कल्प्स्यति, अकल्प्स्यत्, चिक्लृप्स्यति ॥ But कल्पितासे, कल्पिषीष्ट, कल्पिष्यते, अकल्पिष्यत, चिकल्पिषते in the <i>Atmanepada</i>.\n\nIn the case of क्लृप् also, the इट् is added to the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, when the root stands in the same <i>pada</i> with the affixes and there is prohibition everywhere else. So also there is prohibition before <i>krit</i>-affixes, and the <i>luk</i>-elision of <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As चिक्लृप्सिता, चिक्लृप्स त्वं ॥\n\nAccording to <i>Padamanjari</i>, these two <i>sutras</i> could have been shortened thụs:- (1) न वृद्भ्यः पञ्चभ्यः, (2) तासि च; and \"क्लृपः\" could well have been omitted. The तास् comes only after क्लृप and not after other roots of <i>Vritadi</i> class, in <i>Parasmaipada</i> (l. 3. 92) and (l. 3. 93). Therefore, there is no fear that the prohibition तासि च will apply to the other roots of <i>vritadi</i>, but only to '<i>klip</i>', because the word परस्मैपदिषु is understood here; and as no roots of <i>vritadi</i> class take <i>Parasmaipada</i> in the Periphrastic Future except '<i>klip</i>', there is no fear of any ambiguity.",

In fact, whereever there is want of इट्, whether by complete prohibition or optional prohibition, all that is regulated by [[7.2.13]]: this is the view adopted by the <i>Kasika</i>. But another view is that the prohibition of this <i>sutra</i> applies to the इट् of [[7.2.13]] only, but does not debar the option of [[7.2.44]]; so they have two forms विदुधोथ and विदुधविथ ॥ This view is applied by them to [[7.2.46]], as सस्वर्थ or सस्वरिथ [[7.2.44]].\n\nWhy have we used the word वत् in तास्वत् ?

Therefore the rule does not apply to आनञ्जिथ [[7.4.71]], [[7.4.72]]. For the root अञ्जू (VII. 21) takes optionally इट् before तास् [[7.2.44]] as अञ्जिता and अङ्क्ता ॥",

Had it not been so, this rule would have been a <i>vidhi</i> rule and not a <i>niyama</i>: because rule [[7.2.61]] does not apply to long ॠ ending roots, and so if the present <i>sutra</i> were to include long ॠ also, it could not be called a <i>niyama</i> (restriction) of [[7.2.61]].",

This is also a <i>niyama</i> rule with regard to वृ for by [[7.2.13]] the root वृ was already <i>anit</i>, and its Perfect would have been ववर्थ by that rule. The special mention of this form shows that in secular literature this root is always सेट् before थ of the Perfect.",

Therefore, this <i>sutra</i> makes an invariable rule.",
    "72067": "Thus आदिवान्, ओशिवान्, पेचिवान्, शेकिवान् ॥ In the first two of these, the reduplicate stems आद् and आश् become of one syllable by the coalescence of अ अद् and अअश् ॥ In पेच् and शेक् the reduplicate is elided and the vowel अ changed to ए, and thus the reduplicate has become of one syllable. Of roots ending in आ we have, ययिवान्, तस्थिवान्, of घस्-जक्षिवान् ॥ This वस् would have taken the augment by the general rule of इट् increment, the present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i>, so that the roots which are not monosyllabic in their reduplicate form are <i>anit</i>: as बिभिद्वान्, चिच्छिद्वान्, बभूवान्, शिश्रिवान् ॥ The <i>niyama</i> is made with regard to the roots which would have taken इट् generally, as not being governed by the prohibition in [[7.2.13]]. The roots ending in long आ may consist of more than one syllable in their reduplicate form, as याया + वस्, hence their separate enumeration: as a matter of fact, however, these reduplicates also become monosyllabic ultimately by losing their आ ॥ The root दरिद्रा is not governed by this rule, for its Perfect will be formed periphrastically by [[3.1.35]] <i>Vartika</i>, because it consists of more than one syllable: as दरिद्रांचकार ॥ And when आम् is not added, there also दरिद्रा loses its final आ before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes by the <i>vartika</i> under [[6.4.114]]. So the आ being elided before the adding of any affix, this becomes a root which no longer ends in आ, and so the cause of adding इट् under this <i>sutra</i> no longer exists, and so no इट् is added. Thus we have ददरिद्वान्, for before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes दरिद्रा loses its आ ([[6.4.114]] <i>Vartika</i>), and this elision being considered as <i>siddha</i>, ([[6.4.114]] <i>Vartika</i>), no occasion remains for the augment इट् ॥ The घस् becomes जक्ष् in its reduplicate form (a stem of one syllable), but had it not been separately mentioned, then by [[6.4.100]], the penultimate अ of घस् would have been elided first, before reduplication, because [[6.4.100]], is subsequent in order to the rule ordaining reduplication. ([[6.1.14]] &c). The अ being elided, we should have घ्स् only, which not having any vowel, could not be reduplicated. By its separate enumeration here, the augment इट् being ordained by a subsequent rule [[7.2.67]], prevents even the rule of elision [[6.4.100]]. Having, therefore, first added इट्, we then elide the penultimate अ by [[6.4.98]], this elided अ, however, becomes <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of reduplication only by [[1.1.52]].

Observe चिकीर्ष्यात् ॥\n\nThe objector may say, the form चिकीर्ष्यात् will be so by the elision of अ under [[6.4.48]], and so there is no necessity of reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> in this <i>sutra</i>; for when अ is elided by अतोलोपः [[6.4.48]], in the case of <i>ardhadhatuka</i> या the present rule cannot apply, as there is no base left which ends in अ ॥ To this we reply, this is not a good reason: for then in the case of पचेत् and यजेत् also, the rule अतो दीर्घो यञि [[7.3.101]] would apply, and the अ of पच would require to be lengthened. But that is not so. The fact is that the present <i>sutra</i> debars rule [[7.3.101]]. Therefore, as this इय् substitute debars the lengthening of [[7.3.101]], so it would debar the <i>lopa</i> of [[6.4.48]]. Therefore, if the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> be not read into this <i>sutra</i>, the इय् substitute would apply to <i>ardhadhatuka</i> also, and the <i>lopa</i>-elision [[6.4.48]] would not help, as that would be superseded by this special rule. Therefore the <i>anuvritti</i> of \"<i>sarvadhatuka</i>\" should be read into this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThe above is stated on general grounds. But if the maxim मध्येऽपवादाः पूर्वान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् (<i>Apavadas</i> that are surrounded by the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the <i>apavada</i> operations, supersede only those rules that precede, not those that follow them) be applied here, then the present <i>sutra</i> would supersede only the preceding <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.48]] and not the following <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.101]] for which would not be superseded by the present <i>sutra</i>. In this view also, the <i>lopa</i> being superseded at all events, the <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>Sarvadhatuka</i>' must be read into this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nIn the दीर्घ rule [[7.3.101]], the word '<i>sarvadhatuka</i>' is understood from [[7.3.95]]. But according to some, the word तिङि of [[7.3.88]] is also understood there, so that they would lengthen the अ, before a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> personal termination (तिङ्) only, and not before every <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix in general. According to this view, the present <i>sutra</i> will debar only the <i>dirgha</i> rule [[7.3.101]] and not the <i>lopa</i> rule [[6.4.48]], on the maxim येन न प्राप्ति &c.\n\nThe word येयः in the <i>sutra</i> is formed by या + इयः; and या is exhibited without any case-termination. Others say, the word is यः the sixth case of या formed on the analogy of विश्वपः by the elision of आ [[6.4.140]]. Then यः + इयः = य + इयः [[8.3.19]] after this elision, there ordinarily would take place no <i>sandhi</i>; as this elision is considered <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]] for the purposes of [[6.1.87]]. Contrary to this general rule, however, the <i>sandhi</i> takes place here and we have येयः by [[6.1.87]]. The अ in इयः is for the sake of pronunciation only. The real substitute is इय् ॥\n\nSome read the <i>sutra</i> as अतो यासियः ॥ So that the <i>sthani</i> is यास् and not या, and यासियः is a genitive compound.",

But the grammatical construction of the word ङित् in the two <i>sutras</i> (I. 2. I) and [[1.2.4]] is not the same. In the first <i>sutra</i>, it means ङिति इव - ङित्वत्, i. e. the roots गा कुट् &c are treated in the same way as they would have been treated, had a ङित् affix followed. But in the second <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.4]], the word ङिद्वत् is equal to ङित इव \"like of ङित्\" ॥ The <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.1]]. is so explained in order to evolve the form उच्चुकुटिषति ॥ For when the सन् is added to कुट्, the root कुट् is treated as if the सन् was a ङित् affix, and so there is no <i>guna</i>. But if सन् itself had become ङित् then the Desiderative root चुकुटिष्, being a ङित् root would require <i>atmanepada</i> affixes by अनुदात्तङित आत्मनेपदम् (1. 3. 12). In the case, however, of <i>sarvadhatuka</i>-<i>apit</i>-affixes, the affixes themselves become like ङित्, and are treated as ङित् affixes, not only with regard to the stem preceding them, but with regard to their own selves also, as we see in the present <i>sutra</i>.",
    "72082": "Thus पचमानः, यचमानः ॥\n\nThis मुक् is part and parcel of अ only, and not of the <i>anga</i>. For if मुक् be considered as part of the <i>anga</i>, then it will be an intervention, and make the <i>anga</i> end in a consonant and so there will be anomaly in accent. For by [[6.1.186]], the ल <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix is <i>anudatta</i> after a stem ending in अ; so if मुक् be considered part of the <i>anga</i>, the stem no longer ends in अ but म्; but if it be considered as a portion of अ only, then the <i>anga</i> still remains अदुपदेश [[6.1.186]]. So the accent of पचमानः and यजमानः is governed by (VI. I. 186).\n\nAn objector may say, \"if this be so, then the stem पचम् is still considered as ending in अ, and therefore in पचम् + आन, we should apply the previous <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.81]], and change अ into इय्\" ॥ To this we reply, 'no, it cannot be so; for the त् in अत् [[7.2.80]] shows that the अ consisting of one <i>matra</i> is to be taken, but when मुक्  is added, this अ becomes one <i>matra</i> and half, so the rule [[7.2.81]] will not apply; because it applies only to अ of one <i>matra</i>'. The objector:- \"If this is so, then the <i>anudatta</i> of (VI. I. 186) will not also hold good, for there also the अत् means the अ of one <i>matra</i>.\" This is no valid objection. For there the word उपदेश is taken, so that a stem which at the time of <i>upadesa</i> or first enunciation, ends in a short अ of one <i>matra</i>, is governed by that rule; though after the enunciation, the short अ may be lengthened in its <i>matra</i>. It is for this reason that the rule [[6.1.186]] applies to पचावः and पचामः; though the short अ is subsequently lengthened before व and म by [[7.3.101]].\n\nOr the <i>sutra</i> may have been made as आनस्य मुट्, and the augment म् would then be added to आन and not to the verbal stem. All the above difficulties would be removed by this view. But then the final अ of पच &c would require to be lengthened before मान by [[7.3.101]]. This objection, however, is not insuperable, for one view of [[7.3.101]] is that the word तिङि is understood there, so that the lengthening would take place only before a तिङ् affix beginning with a यञ् vowel : and not before any other affix.",

For there will be elision universally before all case-affixes. This is the general rule. To this there is the exception that before non-substitute case-affixes there will be य [[7.2.89]]. To this latter, there is an exception that before non-substitute case-endings beginning with a consonant, आ comes. Thus without any confusion, the आ, the य, and the <i>lopa</i> find their respective scopes.\n\nWhen there is elision, why is not टाप् added in the Feminine; in त्वं ब्राह्मणी; अहं ब्राह्मणी ? The टाप् is not added on the maxim सन्निपात लक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य 'a rule which is occasioned by a certain combination, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination.'

That rule does not apply to <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, because by an <i>ishti</i> that rule is restricted to <i>tyadadi</i> pronouns upto द्वि, thus excluding युष्मद्, अस्मद्, भवतु and किम् ॥",

Similarly [[7.2.97]] teaches that त्व and म replace '<i>yushmad</i>' and '<i>asmad</i>' in the singular; by this <i>sutra</i> '<i>yushm</i>' and '<i>asm</i>' are only replaced. Thus त्वया, मया, the अद् portion remains for which य is substituted by [[7.2.89]].

In the first place this word अन्त is ambiguous, it may mean ending with म् but excluding म्, or ending with म् and including म् ॥ In the second place, the word पर्यन्त is used to indicate the limit, or portion taken out of the whole. The word मान्त would have meant, that form of <i>yusmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> which ends with म् ॥ Now these words have a form which ends in म्, as युष्मानाचष्टे or अस्मानाचष्टे = युष्मते or अस्मते formed by णिच् (the टि portion अद् is elided by [[7.4.155]], <i>vartika</i>).

It might be objected, that even before other affixes and compounds these words had in them <i>vibhaktis</i>, though those <i>vibhaktis</i> were elided when these affixes were added or when the words became part of a compound; and that having in them suppressed <i>vibhaktis</i>, the substitutions would take place in spite of this <i>sutra</i>. This objection is not valid, for there the <i>vibhaktis</i> have been elided. But is not elision a <i>Bahiranga</i> and the substitute an <i>antaranga</i> process; and should not, therefore, the substitute come first and then the <i>vibhakti</i> elided? The substitution specially taught in this <i>sutra</i> is, therefore, a <i>jnapaka</i> and proves the existence of the following maxim :-  अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गोलुग्बाधते 'a <i>bahiranga</i> substitution of लुक् supersedes even <i>antaranga</i> rules'. Thus गोमान् प्रियोऽस्य = गोमत्प्रियः, here the <i>antaranga</i> नुम् augment is superseded by the <i>bahiranga</i> लुक् ॥ This <i>sutra</i> further indicates, that all other substitutes of '<i>yushmad</i>' and '<i>asmad</i>' which take place in the singular, such as तव, मम, तुभ्य, मह्य, त्व, अह, do not take effect, before general affixes or in compounds, but that त्व and म are the only substitutes there even.

The जरस् substitution takes place in the Neuter plural, when the augment नुम् is added: as अतिजरांसि ब्राह्मणकुलानि ॥ In अतिजरसं ब्राह्मणकुलं पश्य the affix is not elided. The form is thus evolved: अतिजर + अम् ॥ Here three rules present themselves simultaneously; first, <i>luk</i>-elision of the affix अम् by [[7.1.23]], (2) then the अम् substitution by [[7.1.24]], (3) and thirdly, जरस् for जर by this rule. Of these लुक्-elision is superseded by अम् of [[7.1.24]] which is an exception to [[7.1.23]]; and in its turn अम् is replaced by the जरस् of this <i>sutra</i>. जरस् being substituted for जर, we have अतिजरस्, now <i>luk</i> cannot again appear and cause elision, as it has already lost the opportunity: and we are left with अम् alone, and have अतिजरसं ॥ In the Nominative Singular and Instrumental Plural we have अतिजरं and अतिजरैः according to the opinion of <i>Gonardiya</i>. The reason being सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य 'that which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination'. Because अम् was added to अतिजर because it ended in अ [[7.1.24]], and similarly भिः was replaced by ऐस् [[7.1.9]]. Now अ has caused the production of अम् and ऐस्, therefore, these latter affixes, though beginning with a vowel will not cause जरस् to be substituted for जर by this rule, for then the produced will cause the destruction of the producer. Others hold that the above maxim is <i>anitya</i>, and we have Nominative Singular अतिजरसं, and Instrumental Plural अतिजरसैः ॥\n\nThe form अतिजरांसि is thus evolved अतिजर + इ ॥ Here if the नुम् augment be added first, it will be a portion of the <i>anga</i>, and will not be an intervention to anything which is to be added or operated upon the <i>anga</i>. But this augment will be an intervention with regard to जरा which is but a portion of the word अतिजर ॥ So that an operation applicable to जरा will not take effect, because of this नुम् intervention. And though <i>tadantaviddhi</i> applies in these chapters (पदाङ्गाधिकारे तस्य च तदन्तस्य च), yet the maxim is that the substitutes only replace those which are specifically exhibited in a rule (निर्दिश्यमानस्य आदेशा भवन्ति), therefore जरस् would not replace जरा which forms only a portion of a full word अतिजर ॥ Even if the substitution does take place, the नुम् would be found after the स् of जरस् ॥ Therefore, the जरस् substitution should be made first, because this is a subsequent rule; and having done so, the नुम् should be added afterwards under [[7.1.72]].\n\nThe form अतिजरसं is thus evolved. We have अतिजर + अम् ॥ Here on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्य अनन्यत्वात्, we substitute जरस् for जर also, (for जर and जरा are considered as one).

A substitute would be a <i>bahiranga</i> with regard to a case-affix that should be added to a compound. Therefore, being an <i>antaranga</i> rule, the <i>ekadesa</i> should be made first, and this <i>ekadesa</i> being considered as the beginning of the subsequent word, we should get erroneous forms like परमहम्, परमयं instead of परमाहम् and परमायम् &c.

The <i>Tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i>, as a general rule, does not apply to compounds, so that a rule made applicable to a particular word, will not apply to a compound which ends with that word: but <i>tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i> applies to a word denoting season when it takes an affix causing <i>Vriddhi</i>, and is preceded by a word denoting a portion. We draw this rule from the present <i>sutra</i>, for हैमनं being formed from हेमन्त by a <i>vriddhi</i>-causing affix [[4.3.22]], the affix अण् will be applied to हेमन्त even when it is the second member of a compound, the first member of which denotes a part. (ऋतोर्वृद्धिमद्विधाववयवात् ( I. 1. 72) <i>Vartika</i> <i>Mahabhashya</i>).\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a portion'? Observe पूर्वासु वर्षासु भवं पौर्ववर्षिकम् with ठञ् [[4.3.11]].

As shown in the above examples, and for direction denoting words see the following <i>sutra</i> ((1. 1. 72) <i>Vartika</i> <i>Malabhashya</i>).",
    "73013": "As पूर्वपाञ्चालकः, अपरपाञ्चालकः, दक्षिणपाञ्चालकः, उत्तरपाञ्चालकः ([[4.2.125]], [[4.2.107]], [[4.2.108]]. [[6.2.105]] accent). The <i>Tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies here, as shown in the preceding <i>sutra</i>. Why do we say 'denoting direction'? Observe पूर्वः पाञ्चालानां = पूर्वपञ्चालः, तत्र भवः, = पौर्वपञ्चालकः, आपरपञ्चालकः ॥ With मद्र we have पौर्वमद्रः, आपरमद्रः with अञ् [[4.2.108]].

These are village names. पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः, अपरपाटलिपुत्रकः, पूर्वकान्यकुब्जः, अपरकान्यकुब्जः ॥\n\nThe word प्राचां in this <i>sutra</i>, as well as in [[7.3.24]], does not here mean 'the eastern grammarians', but 'the eastern countries', because of the context. पूर्वैषुकामशमः is this formed. पूर्वा च असौ इषुकामशमी = पूर्वेषुकामशमी ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.50]]. Then the affix ञ is added to it, in the sense of ततो भवः by [[4.2.107]]. In पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः the affix वुञ् is added by [[4.2.123]]. Though <i>Pataliputra</i> is the name of one city, <i>Purva</i>-<i>pataliputra</i> means the Eastern portion of the city <i>Pataliputra</i>. \n\nThat place is called '<i>grama</i>', where people reside, and a 'nagara' is also a '<i>grama</i>' in this sense. Therefore, the rules which good men observe with regard to '<i>grama</i>', are observed by them in '<i>nagara</i>' also. Thus the rule is अभक्ष्यो ग्रामकुक्कुटः, therefore, the नागर cock is also not eaten. So also ग्रामे नाध्ययम् is applied to <i>nagara</i> also. In this grammar also, we see that '<i>grama</i>' includes '<i>nagara</i>' also, as in [[4.2.109]], [[4.2.117]], [[6.2.103]]. Therefore, where is the necessity of employing the word नगर separately in this aphorism? The two words are separately used, in order to indicate the separate nature and relation of the two kinds of words. The full word पूर्वेषुकामशमी is the name of a '<i>grama</i>', and not the portion इषुकामशमी ॥ But in पूर्वपाटलिपुत्र, the word पाटलिपुत्र itself is the name of the '<i>nagara</i>'. In the present <i>sutra</i>, there is the <i>adhikara</i> of अङ्गस्य and of उत्तरपदस्य ॥ We apply these separately to these two classes of words: namely ग्रामवाचिनाम् अङ्गानाम् and नगरवाचिनाम् उत्तरपदानाम् ॥ This we could not have done without employing these words in the <i>sutra</i>. Therefore, in the case of '<i>grama</i>' word, the <i>vriddhi</i> takes place in that portion of it which follows a direction denoting word (ग्रामवाचिनामङ्गानामवयवस्य दिकशब्दादुत्तरस्य वृद्धिर्भवति). While a <i>nagara</i> word itself gets <i>vriddhi</i> when it is preceded by a direction denoting word (दिशः उत्तरेषां नगराणाम्) ॥ In पूर्वैषुकामशमः, the <i>vriddhi</i> of इषुकामशमी takes place first, and then the combination by <i>sandhi</i>.

The special mention of संवत्सर here, (though this is a परिमाण word and would have been included in the <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.17]]) implies that the word परिमाण in that <i>sutra</i> does not mean the measure of time, but a measure of any other thing than time. Therefore, with other time-words than <i>samvatsara</i>, the <i>Vriddhi</i> takes place in the regular way: as द्वैसमिकः, त्रैसमिकः ॥ Similarly in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.22]], the word परिमाण does not mean the measure of time or numerals, as त्रिवर्षा, द्विवर्षा माणविका ॥ In short, the word परिमाण in these <i>sutras</i> (and elsewhere [[3.2.23]], [[2.3.46]] &c.) means \"mass or bulk\", and not a measure in general.",

The word अभविष्यत् does not qualify the words अधीष्ट and भृत (V. I. 80), the sense of futurity is there denoted by the sentence and not by the <i>taddhita</i>-affix: as द्वे वर्षे अधीष्टो भृतो वा कर्म करिष्यति = द्विवार्षिको मनुष्यः ॥",

Why do we say 'born in that time'? Observe यदा प्रौष्ठपदोमेघः (= प्रोष्ठपदासु भवः) धरणीमभिवर्षति ॥ The plural number प्रोष्ठपदानां indicates that the synonyms of प्रोष्ठपद such as भद्रपाद are also to be included.",

That word, however, does not get the <i>Vriddhi</i> in the second member, As महते सौभगाय ॥ This is a Vedic anomaly. Similarly from सक्तुसिन्धवः (= सक्तुप्रधानाः सिन्धवः) we have साक्तुसैन्धवः (= सक्तुसिन्धुषु भवः) so also पानसिन्धवः ॥ The word सिन्धु occurs in <i>Kachchhadi</i> class, and सैन्धवः is formed by अण् ॥ The <i>Tadanta</i>-rule applies to words formed there-under.\n\nThe words सुहृद् and दुर्हृद् are anomalously formed by [[5.4.150]]. But the reading adopted by <i>Kasika</i> is सुहृदयस्येदम्; so the word <i>hridaya</i> is changed to <i>hrid</i> by [[6.3.50]] or [[6.3.51]].

This prohibition indicates the existence of the following maxim : बहिरङ्गमपि पूर्वोत्तरपदयोः पूर्वं कार्यं भवति, पश्चादेकादेशः or in other words पूर्वोत्तरनिमित्तकार्यात् पूर्वमन्तरङ्गोऽप्येकादेशो न ॥ \"The substitution of one vowel for the final of the first and the initial of the second member of a compound does, even when it is <i>antaranga</i>, not take place previously to an operation which concerns the first or the second member of the compound\".

Whereever <i>Vriddhi</i> is prohibited with regard to a <i>Taddhita</i> affix, that affix cannot be called वृद्धिनिमित्त, and a word formed with such an affix will become masculine in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound referring to a male person, वैयाकरणी भार्या अस्य = वैयाकरणभार्यः ॥ The word वैयाकरण is formed by prohibition of <i>Vriddhi</i>.

Others controvert this opinion, and hold that other affixes causing <i>vriddhi</i> than भाव-affixes, also come after negative-<i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds, such as affixes denoting descendant &c: and भाव-affixes are added to <i>Bahuvrihi</i> negative compounds also, therefore, the force of the <i>anuvritti</i> of अङ्ग, which is understood up to the end of the Seventh <i>Adhyaya</i> [[6.1.1]], and a fortiori in this <i>sutra</i> also, should not be set aside as the above interpretation would do.

Though the root now becomes <i>anudatta</i>, yet because in its <i>upadesa</i> it was <i>udatta</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> will apply and prevent <i>vriddhi</i>. The roots यम्, रम् are <i>anudatta</i> in <i>upadesa</i>, but in यामकः, रामकः they become <i>udatta</i> by लित् accent. This accent is a secondary accent and not the 'original' accent; and hence the present rule does not apply and there is <i>vriddhi</i>. Why do we say ending in म्?

If you say \"let there be <i>vriddhi</i> of णिच्, but this <i>vriddhi</i> will be shortened by [[6.4.92]] because it is a मित् root\", we reply \"this root is not मित्\" ॥ The मित् roots are those enumerated in <i>Bhuadi</i> class, subdivision घटादिः (800). No doubt, there it is said that the roots ending in अम् are मित् (in अमन्ताश्च). But a root is regarded मित् only with regard to the Causative णिच् affix, and not with regard to that णिच् of the <i>Churadi</i> class where the sense of the causative is not involved in it. Therefore this root is not मित् [[6.4.93]].\n\nThe phrases सूर्यविश्रामा भूमिः and others like it are incorrect. Why do we say 'चिण् and <i>krit</i> only'? Observe शशाम, ददाम, चचाम ॥",

Similarly री includes रीङ् स्रवणे (<i>Divadi</i> 30), and री गतिरेषणयोः (<i>Kryadi</i> 30). The augment is added at the end of the preceding stem of root, and not to the affix. Being added to the root it becomes part of the root-stem, and in forming the reduplicate Aorist of such stems, the vowel before प् is shortened by [[7.4.1]]. If प् were not the part of the stem, that vowel would not be shortened. Thus from दापयति; we have Aorist अदीदपत् ॥",
    "73037": "As निशाययति, अवच्छाययति, अवसाययति, ह्वाययति, संव्याययति, वाययति, and पाययति ॥ The word पा includes the root पा 'to drink'. (<i>Bhuadi</i> 972) पे 'to dry' (<i>Bhuadi</i> 968). but not पा 'to protect' (<i>Adadi</i> 47): because the latter looses the शप् <i>vikarana</i>.\n\nVart:- The root पा 'to protect' takes the augment लुक् before णि, as पालयति ॥\n\nVart:- The roots घुञ् and प्रीञ् take the augment नुक् before णि, as धूनयति, प्रीणयति ॥\n\nAll these augments are added to the roots, in order that [[7.4.1]] should cause the shortening of the vowel preceding these. Thus the Aorist of the above are: अशीशयत्, अपीपलत्, अदूधुनत्, अपीप्रिणत् ॥\n\nThe roots शा, छा, सा, ह्वा, व्या and पा are exhibited as ending in long आ their <i>Dhatupatha</i> forms are श, शो, छो, सै, सो, ह्वे, व्ये and पै ॥ This indicates that these roots would have taken पुक् by the last <i>sutra</i>, the word आत् 'ending in long आ' means the roots which actually end in long आ, as well as those which get long आ by [[6.1.45]]. This also indicates, that in this subdivision or section, the maxim of <i>lakshana</i> <i>pratipadokta</i> &c does not apply. Therefore when the roots इ with अपि, and जि assume the form अधि-आ and जा before the affix णि by (VI. I. 48), the augment पुक् is added to them, thus अध्यापयति, जापयति ॥",
    "73038": "As पक्षेणोपवाजयति ॥ But आ वापयति केशान् when the sense is not that of shaking. This form could have been obtained from the root वज् 'to move\", (<i>Bhuadi</i> 271) with the affix णि in the ordinary way without any augment. The special augment ज् to वा indicates that this root will not take युक्, which it would have otherwise done by the last <i>sutra</i>. The root वा belongs to <i>Bhuadi</i> 969(ओवै शोषणे) ॥",
    "73039": "As वि लीनयति, वि लालयति, वि लाययति, or वि लापयति घृतम् ॥ The augment नुक् is added to ली when the root ends in long ई, and that also optionally. When the augment is not added, the regular causative लाययति is formed. But when ली gets the form ला by (VI. I. 51), it does not take the augment नुक् ॥ The root ली includes both ली and लीङ् of <i>Kryadi</i> and <i>Divadi</i>. The root ला includes ला 'to give' (<i>adadi</i> 49), and ला the form assumed by ली under [[6.1.51]]. When लुक् is not added to ला, पुक् is added by [[7.3.36]]. Why do we say when meaning 'to melt fat'? Observe only लोहे विलापयति, जटाभिरालापयते [[1.3.70]].",
    "73040": "As मुण्डो भीषयते, जटिलो भीषयते ॥ See [[1.3.68]]. Herealso भी with long ई being employed in the <i>sutra</i>, indicates that षुक् is added then only, when the root has the form भी, but when it assumes the form भा by (VI. I. 56), the proper augment पुक् will come: as मुण्डो भापयते ॥ Why do we say 'when the agent of the causative is himself the direct cause of fear'? Observe कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति, for here कुञ्चिका causes fear and not the agent of the verb. The ई is <i>vriddhied</i> and आय substituted.",

    "73043": "As व्रीहीन् रोपयति or रोहयति ॥ According to <i>Padamanjari</i> this <i>sutra</i> could be dispensed with. The form रोपयति could be obtained from the root रुप् of <i>Divadi</i> class : which though meaning मोहन may be taken to mean 'grow' also; अनेकार्थत्वाद् धातूनाम् ॥",
    "73044": "That which stands in an affix is called प्रत्ययस्थ, i.e. क् must be the part of the affix. The अक् is changed into इक् in the feminine in आ ॥ As जटिलिका, मुण्डिका, गुणिका, दत्तिका, कारिका, हारिका  So also एतिका from एतद् + अकच् + आप् एतकद् + आप् ॥ The द् is then replaced by अ [[7.2.102]]. The क् must belong to the affix, therefore, not in शका from शक शक्नोति ॥ The स्थ in प्रत्ययस्थ is for the sake of distinctness, there is no affix which is only क ॥  The rule applies to क, therefore not to नन्दना, रमणा ॥ The इ is substituted for the अ which precedes (पूर्वस्य) क्, and not the अ which follows क्, as पटुका, मृदुका ॥ The must be preceded by short अ, therefore, not here गोका, नौका, nor in राका, धाका ॥ The substitution takes place when आ follows, therefore, not in कारकी ॥ The word आपि qualifies क् ॥ The क् should be followed by आ ॥ Objection: But in कारिका from कारक + आ, क् is not directly followed by आ, but by अ? Answer: When अ + आ = आ there is <i>ekadesa</i>, the क् is followed by आ, there being no third letter intervening then. Objection: But an <i>ekadesa</i> is <i>sthanivat</i> to what it replaces when a <i>purva</i>-<i>vidhi</i> is to be applied, therefore there still exists the intervention. Answer: The express text of this <i>sutra</i> will remove the intervention. Objection: Then इ should be substituted in रथकट्या and गर्गकाम्या ॥ These words are formed by the affixes कट्यच् and काम्यच्, as रथानां समूहः, [[4.2.51]] and गर्गमिच्छति आत्मनः (III. I. 9) = रथकट्य and गर्गकाम्य ॥ Here also before the क् of the affix, the अ should be replaced by इ, when the feminine affix आ is added: for there is no intervention between क् and आ (the intermediate letters being non-existent, as you say). Answer: We say that intervention is no intervention, when it consists of only one letter, which even does not actually exist, but only through the fiction of <i>sthanivat</i>. Therefore, the feminine of the above words will not take इ, as क् is not followed immediately (in the sense above expressed) by आप्, as रथकट्या and गर्गकाम्या, because in these actually many letters are heard as intervening between the क् and आप् ॥\n\nWhy do we say असुप्ः 'provided that the feminine affix आप् does not come after a case-affix? Observe बहवः परिव्राजका अस्यां मथुरायां = बहुपरिव्राजका मथुरा ॥ Here आप् comes after the noun बहुपरिव्राजक which ends in a case-affix, and hence the अ of ज is not changed to इ ॥ The case-affix is elided by [[2.4.71]], and it still exerts its influence by [[1.1.62]]. The word असुपः is a प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः (a simple prohibition of the particular matter specified without mentioning what is different from it): and not a पर्युदासः or exception. Had it been a <i>Paryudasa</i>, (सुपोऽन्यः = असुपः) then आप् coming after a full word not having a case-affix, would have caused the इ substitution in the last example. Nor should असुपः be explained as that in which there exists no case-affix. Had it been so, then in बहूनि चर्माण्यस्यां = बहुचर्मिका not इ ought to be added.\n\nVart:- मामक and नरक should be enumerated, for the क् of these is not part of the affix: as मामिका, नरिका ॥ Here ममक् is substituted for मम before the affix अण् [[4.3.3]], to which is then added टाप् ॥ The word ममक takes long ई in the feminine only when it is a Name or in the <i>Vedas</i> [[4.1.30]]: therefore though मामक ends in अण्, it does not take ङीप् [[4.1.15]] but टाप् (IV. I. 4), नराम् कायति = नरक formed with the affix क (अ [[3.2.3]]).\n\nVart:- The rule applies to the words ending in त्यक् [[4.2.98]] and त्यप्, [[4.2.104]] in spite of the prohibition in [[7.3.46]]. As दाक्षिणात्यिका, इहत्यिका ॥\n\nThe word in the <i>sutra</i> is कात् the fifth case of क ending in अ ॥ If then this be the condition, that the affix must end in <i>ka</i> क and not in <i>k</i> क्, then the rule will not apply to एतिका ॥ Because here the augment is अकच् (अक्) with क्; the final अ in अकच् is for euphony only, and not a portion of the affix, as we find in भिन्धकि, छिन्धकि, रुन्धकि ॥ The word कात therefore, is construed to mean ending in the consonant क ॥",
    "73045": "As यका सका ॥ The या and सा simply stand for यद् and तद्, and the prohibition is not confined to the nominative case only, as the forms या and सा may lead one to think. न यत् तदोः would have been a better <i>sutra</i>. The prohibition applies in every case, as यकामधीते, तकां पचामहे ॥ Or यकांयकामधीमहे (i.e. ऋचां गाथां च), and तकां तकाम्पचामहे (i. e. औषधीं शाकिनीं वा)\n\nVart:- The affix त्यकन् [[5.3.34]] should be enumerated also along with यत् and तद् ॥ As उपत्यका, अधित्यका ॥\n\nVart:- The feminine of पावक &c in the <i>Veda</i> does not take इ for अ ॥ As हिरण्यवर्णः शुचयः पावकाः, यासु अ लोमकाः, ऋक्षकाः &c. But पाविकाः, अलामिकाः in secular literature.\n\nVart:- So also in the affix वुन् used in benediction: as जीवताद् जीवका, नन्दताद् नन्दका, भवताद् भवका ॥ See (III. I. 150).\n\nVart:- So also when the second member is elided in a compound: as देवका, यज्ञका, the second member दत्त is elided, the fuller forms being देवदत्तिका, यज्ञदत्तिका (अनजादौ च विभाषा लोपो वक्तव्यः) See [[5.3.83]] <i>Vartika</i>.\n\nVart:- क्षिपक &c should be enumerated in this prohibition : as क्षिपका, ध्रुवका, धुवका, चटका ॥\n\nVart:- तारका is formed when it means 'stars', but तारिका 'a maid-servant' from तारयति ॥  \n\nVart:- वर्णका is formed when it means 'a mantle or mask', but वर्णिका 'an expounder': as वर्णिका भागुरी लोकायते '<i>Bhaguri</i> is a commentary of <i>Lokayata</i>'\n\nVart:- वर्तका 'a bird' according to the Eastern grammarians, but वर्तिका according to the Northern authorities. Why do we say 'when meaning a bird'? 'Observe वर्त्तिका भागुरी लोकायतस्य ॥\n\nVart:- अष्टका when meaning a पितृदैवत्य ceremony, but अष्टिका खारी ॥ The ceremony related to <i>Pitridevata</i> is called <i>Pitridaivatya</i>, the affix is यत् ॥ The former is derived from the root अश् with the affix तकन् (अश्नन्ति ब्राह्मणा ओदनमस्यां), the other is derived from the numeral अष्ट by the affix कन् (V. I. 22).\n\nVart:- Optionally सूतका, पुत्रका and वृन्दारका, the other forms are सूतिका, पुत्रिका, and वृन्दारिका ॥",
    "73046": "The mention of 'northern grammarians' makes this an optional rule. As इभ्यका or इभ्यिका, क्षत्रियका or क्षत्रियिका, चटकका or चटकिका, मूषिकका, मूषिकिका ॥ Why do we say preceded by य् or क् ? Observe अश्वक-अश्विका only (from अश्वा) ॥ The word यकपूर्वायाः is exhibited in the feminine, in order to indicate that the rule applies when the feminine affix आ is shortened to अ ॥ Therefore not here शुभंयिका from शुभंया (शुभं याति). So also भद्रंयिका from भद्रया, where आ is part of the root या (see [[3.2.74]]).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the य् and क् being finals of a root. When the य् or क् preceding this अ, is the final of the root, the prohibition contained in the <i>sutra</i>, does not apply: as सुनयिका, सुशयिका, and अशोकिका ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of long आ'? Observe सांकाश्ये भवा = सांकाश्यिका ॥ The word संकाश्य is formed from संकाश by the affix ण्य (संकाशे निर्वृत्तं) ॥ Then is added the affix वुञ् [[4.2.121]]. Here there is no shortening of a long आ, and hence no option is allowed. But in इभ्यका or इभ्यिका the long आ has been shortened. Because this word is thus derived: इभमर्हति = इभ्या (दण्डादिभ्योयः (V. I. 66)). To this क is added, and the long आ is shortened.\n\nWhy is the word स्थान used in the <i>sutra</i>, when by the general rule षष्ठी स्थाने योगः this word would be understood here? The special mention is for the sake of pointing out that the अ which takes the place of आ is intended here: i. e. the इ replaces this short अ; but had the word स्थाने not been used in the <i>sutra</i> the इ would have replaced the long आ ॥",
    "73047": "As भस्त्रका or भस्त्रिका, अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका, एषका or एषिका, अजका or अजिका, ज्ञका or ज्ञिका, अज्ञका or अज्ञिका, द्वके or द्विके, स्वका or स्विका, अस्वका or अस्विका ॥ Of एषा and द्वि there are no examples with the negative particle. For if the compounding with नञ् takes place after the addition of the अकच्, or on the contrary, if first अकच् be added and then the नञ् compounding takes place, in both alternatives, the case-affixes must be added in order to substitute अ for the final by [[7.2.102]]: and it is only when this अ is substituted that the feminine टाप् can come. So that the case-affix is the principal ingredient, and टाप् comes after सुप्, and therefore by the prohibition of असुपः in [[7.3.44]], there can arise no occasion for the substitution of इ ॥ Therefore अनेषका and अंद्वके are the invariable forms of these words with the negative particle. स्व meaning agnates and property, takes the negative particle. भस्त्रा is a word which has no corresponding masculine form, and as such, by the following rule [[7.3.48]] it would not have taken इ; its special mention here indicates that it should be the secondary member of the compound here: as अविद्यमाना भस्त्रा यस्या = अभस्त्रा, the Diminutive of which is अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका ॥ Here first the भस्त्रा is shortened as it is a secondary member (<i>upasarjana</i>), then when the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is made, the feminine affix टाप् is added to this भाषितपुंस्क word, then this आ is shortened before क by [[7.4.13]]. This short अ [[7.4.13]] does not come in the room of the आ which is ordained to come after a word having no corresponding masculine.\n\nThe force of अपि shows that the rule applies, when words other than नञ् also precede, and even when no words precede. As निर्भस्त्रिका or निर्भस्त्रका, बहुभस्त्रिका or बहुभस्त्रका ॥\n\nNote: The form द्वके is from the word द्वकि, dual number, the final इ is changed to अ (त्यदाद्यत्व), then the feminine आ (टाप्) is added (द्वका), and then शी is substituted for औ ॥",
    "73048": "As खट्वका or खट्विका, अखट्विका or अखट्वका, परमखट्वका or परमखट्विका ॥ When before the affix कप्, the stem is shortened in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, this rule will apply [[7.4.15]]. There also, the अ must be substituted for the आ of a feminine word which has no corresponding masculine. But this rule does not apply when the negative compound is the synthesis of अविद्यमाना खट्वा अस्याः = अखट्वा, अल्पा अखट्वा =अखट्विका ॥ Similarly अतिक्रान्ता खट्वाम् = अतिखट्वा, अल्पा अतिखट्वा =अतिखट्विका ॥\n\nNote: The word खट्वा is always feminine and has no corresponding masculine.",
    "73049": "As खट्वाका, अखट्वाका or परमखट्वाका ॥\n\nNote: The \"Teachers\" referred to here are either those other than the Northern Grammarians, or it may refer to the Teacher of <i>Panini</i>, the plural being for the sake of respect. Thus there are three forms अखट्वका, अखट्विका, and अखट्वाका ॥",
    "73050": "As आक्षिकः, शालाकिकः (ठक् [[4.4.1]]), लावणिकः (ठञ् [[4.4.52]]). In the affixes ठक्, ठञ् &c, if the affix is the consonant ठ्, and अ is only for euphony, then here also the अ is for pronunciation only: but if on the contrary, the aggregate ठ (ठ् + अ) is the affix, then the same is the case here. This rule does not apply in <i>Unadi</i> affixes always, as कणेष् ठः = कण्ठः (<i>Unadi</i> l. 103), for there is diversity (बहुल) in the <i>Unadi</i>.\n\nमाथितिकः (= मथितं पण्यमस्य [[4.4.51]]) is thus formed मथित + ठक् = मथित् + इक [[6.4.148]] theअ is dropped)). Now arises the doubt, should इक be replaced by क as taught in the next aphorism [[7.3.51]], as it comes after a त् ॥ This substitution, however, does not take place, because it was इक् which caused the elision of अ, and now त् which became final by such elision cannot cause the destruction of इक its producer (सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य). Or the elided अ [[6.4.148]] may be considered as <i>sthanivat</i>, and would thus prevent क substitution.\n\nThere are two views about this ठ ॥ Some say that the consonant ठ् only is the <i>sthani</i>, and the अ is only for the sake of pronunciation. The others hold that ठ, the consonant and the vowel are <i>sthani</i> in the aggregate. In the first view, the rule would apply to the consonant ठ् at the end of roots like पठ् in पठिता, पठितुं; in the other view the rule would apply to the affix अठच् in कर्मठः ॥  Hence, the commentary uses the word, that ठ must be the cause of अङ्ग ॥",

But also यदग्निरग्नये ददात् ॥ The form ददात्, however, may also be deduced even when the final of  दा is elided, for then by the आट् augment [[3.4.94]] we get this form. The word वा is therefore employed in the <i>sutra</i> only for the sake of distinctness, for the <i>sutra</i> without वा would have also given the above forms, as we have shown. Or the वा is used to remove the doubt which one may entertain to this effect \" ददात् is the form which may be deduced by the general rule, since लोप is taught, this form will be excluded altogether and will never appear\".\n\nThe form दधत् is thus evolved. We add तिप् to the root धा; then the इ of ति is elided [[3.4.97]]. दाशुषे = यजमानाय रत्नानि दद्यात् ॥ Others say, the दधत् is the form of the root with the शतृ affix. ददत् is from the root दाञ् ॥\n\nSome say that वा is <i>jnapaka</i> and indicates the existence of the following maxim :- अनित्यमागमशासनम् \"the rule about augments is <i>anitya</i>\". So that the augment आट् being <i>anitya</i>, we could not have got the form ददात् ॥ Hence the employment of the word वा ॥",

For लोप would have elided only the final अ of स ॥ But even with the elision of अ alone we would have got all the above forms, except those in वहि ॥ For अ being elided, we have स् between ह् (a consonant of झल् class) and a dental (which is also a letter of झल् class). This स् situate between two झल् will be elided by [[8.2.26]]. Nor can it be objected that the elided अ is <i>sthanivat</i>, for by पूर्वत्रासिद्धं [[8.2.1]], such an elision cannot be <i>sthanivat</i>. Though व् is a dento-labial, yet it is included in the word dental. Had it not been meant to be so included, तौ (letters of त class) would have been taken in the <i>sutra</i>. See (III.

    "73075": "As ष्ठीवति, क्लामति, and आ चामति ॥ क्लम् lengthens its vowel before श्यन् by the last rule, the present rule produces this change before the affix शप् also, which it gets by [[3.1.70]]. चम् lengthens its vowel only when it is preceded by आ; therefore not here: चमति, विचमति or उचमति ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is exhibited as ष्ठिवुक्लमु चमां शिति  in the original text of <i>Panini</i>; the present form, owes its existence to the insertion of आ from the <i>vartika</i> दीर्घत्वमाङि चमः ॥",
    "73076": "As क्रामति, क्रामतः, क्रमन्ति ॥ Why in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>? Observe आक्रमते आदित्यः ॥ How do you explain the lengthening in उत्क्राम and संक्राम (Imperative 2nd Person Singular)? For when हि is elided by लुक्, [[6.4.105]] then by [[1.1.63]], the affix being dropped by a लु-elision, it would produce no effect and so there ought to have been no lengthening? This is no valid objection. The prohibition of (l. I. 63), applies to the अङ्ग stem after which the affix is elided. Here क्रम् is not a stem or <i>anga</i> with regard to हि, but it is a stem with regard to शप्, as क्रम् + शप् + हि ॥ Therefore, though हि is elided, the lengthening will take place by [[1.1.62]], (प्रत्यय लक्षणम्) ॥",

There we have इष्यति and इष्णाति respectively. Those who do not read the <i>sutra</i> as इषु &c, but as इषगमि &c, read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word अचि from [[7.3.72]] into this <i>sutra</i>; so that the शित् is qualified by the word अच्, i.e. a शित् affix which is merely a vowel, and has no consonant in it; (and not a शित् affix which begins with a vowel). Therefore though शानच् is a शित् affix beginning with a vowel, yet as it contains a consonant, the छ substitution does not take place, as इषाणः [[3.1.83]] The reading of the text according to <i>Patanjali</i> and <i>Katyayana</i> is इषगमियमां छ, and hence the necessity of the above explanation. The reading इषु, though convenient, is not <i>arsha</i>.",

Or the substitute पिब is one which ends with अ, and is acutely accented on the first. It must be acutely accented on the first; otherwise by [[6.1.162]], the acute will be on the last पिब꣡ ॥ Then when there is <i>ekadesa</i> with शप्, the acute will be on the middle in पिब꣡ति, which is not desired. धौ is substituted for सृ when the sense is 'to run, move quickly'; in any other sense, we have प्रसरति, अनुसरति ॥",

Why जा (long) and not ज, for this ज would assume the form जा by [[7.3.101]]? This long आ of जा indicates the existence of the maxim given above in [[7.3.78]]; and had ज been the substitute, [[7.3.101]], could not have lengthened it.",

Thus पुनाति, लुणाति, स्तृणाति ॥ Those who hold that <i>Pvadi</i> roots are upto the end of the Class, explain the non-shortening of जानाति (for ज्ञा would also then become <i>Pvadi</i>), by saying that the express text of [[7.3.79]], substituting long जा prevents the shortening. They say had ज्ञा been also shortened, then merely ज substitute would have been enough and not जा; and this ज would have been lengthened in the case of जन् by [[7.3.101]], to form जायते ॥",

The <i>Bhvadi</i> मिद् will get <i>guna</i> before शप् by virtue of [[7.3.86]], but the <i>Divadi</i> मिद् would not have got <i>guna</i> before श्यन्, as this affix is ङित् [[1.2.4]]: hence the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>.

When this <i>guna</i> is substituted, there does not take effect that rule, which causes <i>Vriddhi</i> of the penultimate short अ of जागर; (अत उपधायाः [[7.2.116]]). Had that been the case, then the <i>guna</i> substitution would become simply useless, and the prohibition with regard to चिण् and णल् superfluous. Why do we say not before वि, चिण् and णल् and ङित्? Observe जागविः (with the affix विन् <i>Unadi</i>) अजागारि with चिण् which causes <i>Vriddhi</i>, and अजागार with णल्, and जागृतः and जागृथः with a ङित् [[1.2.4]] affix. Some hold that the इ in वि is for the sake of pronunciation only, and the prohibition applies to all affixes beginning with a व, such as कसु, as जजागृवान्, here there is no <i>guna</i>. In अजागरुः with जुस् the <i>guna</i> takes place by virtue of [[7.3.83]]: for though it is a ङित् affix also, the prohibition ङितसु of this <i>sutra</i> does not affect it. Similarly अहं जजागर with णल् the optional <i>guna</i> [[7.1.91]] is also not prohibited by the णल् of this <i>sutra</i>. In fact the phrase अविचिण् णल् ङितसु is a <i>Paryudasa</i> prohibition : for had it been a <i>prasayya</i>-<i>pratishedha</i>, then the <i>guna</i> before जुस् and the Ist Person णल् would also have been prohibited. In short this <i>sutra</i> positively ordains <i>guna</i> of जागृ before every affix, other than वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित्, and if by any other rule these latter would cause <i>guna</i>, that <i>guna</i> is not prohibited. That is the result of <i>Paryudasa</i> negation.\n\nBut if the <i>sutra</i> be construed as a <i>Prasayyapratishedha</i>, then we shall apply the maxim अनन्तरस्य विधिर्वा भवति प्रतिषेधो वा ॥ The prohibition is therefore stated with regard to जाग्र in connection with the affixes वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित् ॥ But the <i>guna</i> ordained by [[7.3.84]], [[7.3.83]] is not prohibited.",

Thus भिद् + तृ, though द् + तृ = त्तृ  causes the इ to become heavy, that will not prevent <i>guna</i>: for विध्यपेक्षं लघुग्रहणम् ॥ Objection : If this be so, why the forms कुण्डितृ, हुण्डितृ are not incorrect, for in them also the vowel is <i>laghu</i> (the roots are कुड् and हुड्), and the augment म् is added afterwards by a <i>Vidhi</i> rule? Answer: The augment म् is added to the root, and becomes <i>upadesivat</i>. (See [[7.1.58]]). Objection: If so, how do you cause <i>Vriddhi</i> in रञ्ज्, as in रागः with घञ्; as रञ्ज् + घञ् = रज् + घञ् (the ञ् being dropped by [[6.4.27]]), for it is after the elision of ञ्, that the of रज् becomes penultimate and can admit of <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.116]]? Answer: The exceptional forms स्यदः from स्यन्द् + घञ्, and श्रथः from श्रन्थ + घञ्, taught in (Vl. 4. 28); [[6.4.29]] teach by implication that roots of this form take <i>Vriddhi</i> as a general rule. Objection: If the विध्यपेक्ष maxim is not of universal application: though by [[6.4.134]], the अ of अन् &c. is elided in <i>bha</i> stems, like राजन् thus राज्ञा; yet the अ shoud not be elided if you be consistent, in आनङ् augment added by [[7.1.75]] to दधि, अस्थि &c. In fact, you could not get the forms दध्ना सक्थ्ना &c. Moreover though there can be the lengthening of the penultimate in सामन् = सामानि (before शि affix Nominative Plural), yet not in the case of कुण्डानि from कुण्ड for here न् is added by another rule [[7.1.72]]. If you say, the maxim is not of universal application, then there can be no <i>guna</i> of इ in भिद् to form भेत्तृ ॥ Answer: The <i>guna</i> takes place in forms like भेत्तृ &c, because the prohibition of the following rule [[7.3.87]], with regard to the affixes beginning with a vowel, proves by implication that before affixes beginning with a consonant, as तृ, the <i>guna</i> also takes place. Objection: The prohibition in the case of vowel beginning affixes is for the sake of लङ्, to form अनेनेक् ॥ This is derived from निजिर् (<i>Juhotyadi</i> 11), in the Imperfect, as अ + निज् + शप्श्लु + तिप् then reduplication (VI. I. 10), then <i>guna</i> of the reduplicate, [[7.4.75]], then तिप् which had become त in the Imperfect, is elided by [[6.1.68]]. Thus अनिज् + श्लु + त् = अ + निनिज् + त् [[6.1.10]] = अ नेनिज् + त् [[7.4.75]] = अ नेनिज् [[6.1.98]] = अननक्. The elided त् produces its effect, the <i>guna</i> by [[7.3.86]]. This is why अच् is taken in <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.87]], namely अजादि affixes do not cause <i>guna</i>, the हलादि affixes like त् cause <i>guna</i>. You cannot therefore say that अचि in [[7.3.87]] is a <i>jnapaka</i>. Answer: The <i>sutra</i> त्रसिगृधिधृषिक्षिपेः क्नुः [[3.2.140]] teaches the addition of नु to त्रस् &c, as गृध्नुः; if this नु had not tended to cause the <i>guna</i> of the penultimate vowels of these roots, what was the necessity of making this affix a कित्? Similarly [[1.2.10]] teaches that सन् (Desiderative) is कित् after roots ending in consonants. These rules show that words like भत &c get <i>guna</i>, and the final consonant of the root plus the initial consonant of the affix, does not make the root vowel heavy. Objection: The कित् of सन् is for the sake of the elision of the nasal, in धिप्सति, धाप्सति [[6.4.24]]. Answer: Let it be so: still the कित् of क्नु is enough for us.\n\nThe \"<i>upadha</i> short\" must be the vowels of the इक् <i>pratyahara</i>. Therefore in भिनत्ति, the penultimate is short अ (of श्नम्) and it does not take <i>guna</i>. In fact, the word penultimate qualifies the word इक् understood. Others explain it by saying that पुगन्त is to be analysed by पुकि अन्त \"in the vicinity of प्\" ॥ The word अन्त means समीप, and means the इक् vowel in the proximity of पुक् ॥ The word लघूपधा should be analysed as लघ्वी उपधा and is a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound, and means \"a short or light penultimate\".

    "74001": "As अचीकरत्, अजीहरत्, अलीलवत्, अपीपठत् ॥ Here the rules of reduplication and shortening of the penultimate both present themselves simultaneously. The rule about shortening, being subsequent in order, is applied first, and then the reduplication takes place. Thus कारि + अत् = कार् + अत् (णि being elided [[6.4.51]]) = कर् + अत् (shortening [[7.4.1]]) = चकर् + अत् [[6.1.11]] = चिकर् + अत् [[7.4.93]], [[7.4.79]] = चीकरत् [[7.4.94]]. The necessity of maintaining this order will appear from the following considerations. The Causative stem of अट् is आटि; the Aorist of which is आटि + चङ् + त् = आट् + अत् [[6.4.51]]. Now if reduplication took place first we shall have आटिट् + अत् [[1.1.59]] the elided इ will be present for the purposes of reduplication) and as the penultimate is short already, the form will be आटिटत्, which with the augment अ will be अ + आटिटत् = आटिटत् ॥ This is a correct form, so far as it goes; but when the augment is elided in connection with the negative मा, the form will be मा भवान् आटिटत्, the correct form however is मा भवान् अटिटत् with a short अ, which can be formed if we shorten first and then reduplicate, as आट् + अत् = अट् + अत् = अटिट् + अत् = अटिटत्, which with the augment अ, will be आटिटत् ॥ In fact, though the reduplication of the second syllable [[6.1.2]] is a <i>nitya</i> rule, because it applies even where a penultimate is shortened and where not, yet the rule about shortening takes effect first, because the author has himself indicated this, by making the root ओण have an indicatory ऋ in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (See [[7.4.2]] about ऋदित् verbs). For had the reduplication taken place first in the case of ओण् (<i>Bhuadi</i>. 482), as ओणिण्, there would be no long vowel to be shortened, and there would be no necessity of the probibition [[7.4.2]].\n\nObjection: Why do we say 'in the Causative'? The चङ् Aorist is formed of Causatives only (See (III. I. 48)), the only exceptions being the simple roots श्रि, ब्रु, सु, धेट् and श्वि, none of which have any vowel in the penultimate and कम् and सुप् have already short <i>upadha</i>. The <i>sutra</i> चङ्युपधाया ह्रस्वः would have been enough. Answer: Had the <i>sutra</i> been, as proposed, then it would have meant, 'that which is penultimate when चङ् follows, should be shortened'. Therefore in the Aorist of the Causative of लू, we have लू + णि + चङ् + त् = लू + इ + अत् here the penultimate with regard to चङ् is ऊ, which would be shortened; debarring <i>Vriddhi</i> and आव् substitute, and there would have come the उवङ् substitute instead. But that is not the case. We have अलीलवत्, and not अलुलुवत् ॥ Similarly, in the Aorist of the Causative of दा, we shall have दा + इ + अत्, and आ being shortened we have द + इ + अत, so that we cannot add the augment पुक् [[7.3.36]], and form अदीदपत् ॥ And the forms like अपीपचत् (पच् + इ + अत्) would not at all admit of shortening.\n\nWhy do we say when चङ् follows ? Observe कारयति, हारयति where there is no shortening in the Present Tense. Why do we say of the penultimate? Observe अचकाङ्क्षत् from काङ्क्ष्, and अववाञ्छत् from वाञ्छ, where the penultimate being a consonant, there can be no shortening. Had the word penultimate been not used, the vowels of these would be shortened. And the word '<i>upadha</i>' is also absolutely necessary for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> like [[7.4.4]], and it prevents shortening in the above case, which would have otherwise taken place, on the maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात् which qualifies [[1.1.67]].\n\nVart:- The rule of shortening of the penultimate applies to the चङ् Aorist of the Causative of the Causative i. e. to the double Causative even. Thus अवीवदत् (= वादितवन्तं प्रयोजितवान्) वीणां परिवादकेन ॥ Otherwise वादि + इ + अत् = वाद् + इ + अत् = वाद् + ० + अत् ॥ Here the elided इ being <i>sthanivat</i>, will prevent shortening, or because the stem has lost a simple-vowel (अग्लोपिन्), it will not be shortened. The present <i>vartika</i> makes it so however.",
    "74002": "The word अग्लोपिन् means literally a stem, in which a simple vowel (अक् <i>pratyahara</i>) or a portion containing an अक् vowel has been dropped. As the final vowels of Denominative stems are so elided before the Causative sign णि, the <i>sutra</i> has been translated accordingly. Thus अममालत् = मालामाख्यत्; अममातरत् = मातरमाख्यत्, अत्यरराजत् = राजानमतिक्रान्तवान्, अन्वलुलामत् = लोमान्यनुमृष्टवान् ॥ Where a simple अक् vowel alone is elided, as in the case of माला, there the elided आ being <i>sthanivat</i>, would prevent the shortening, the आ of मा not being then considered penultimate. So that अग्लोपिन् could be spared from the <i>sutra</i>, since the <i>sthanivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> would prevent shortening. But where an अक् vowel plus a consonant is dropped, as in राजन् and लोमन्, there the <i>sthanivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> does not apply (I. I. 57), hence the necessity of employing the term अग्लोपिन् in the <i>sutra</i>. Similarly अशशासत् with शास्; and अबबाधत् from बाधृ, अययाचत् from याचृ, and अडुढौकत् from ढौकृ ॥ See (III.

Thus अपीप्यत्, अपीप्यताम्, अपीप्यन् ॥ When the penultimate आ is elided, there remains प् which cannot be reduplicated as having no vowel, but the elided आ is considered as <i>sthanivat</i> and thus पा is reduplicated. <i>Sutra</i> [[7.4.80]] establishes by implication the principle that the substitutes caused by णि are <i>sthanivat</i>.

On the maxim पूर्वं धातुः साधनेन युज्यते पश्चादुपसर्गेण 'a root is first developed fully and then the preposition is added to it'; we first develop कृ in the Perfect by reduplication, which gives us चकृ + अतुस्, then we add the preposition as संचकृ + अतुः, then we add सुट् though the reduplicate intervenes, by (VI. I. 136) and (VI. I. 137), as संचस्कृ + अतुः, now the root assumes a form in which the penultimate begins with a double consonant, and applying the <i>vartika</i> we make <i>guna</i>, and get संचस्करतुः ॥\n\nIt is by this consideration that in संस्कृषीष्ट, उपस्कृषीष्ट, the सुट् augment being <i>Bahiranga</i> and consequently considered as non-existent (<i>asiddha</i>), there\nis no इट् augment added by [[7.2.43]].",

The word 'short' is used in the <i>sutra</i>, in order to debar the इर् and उर् alternatives. Had the <i>sutra</i> been \"शॄ दॄ प्रां वा\" the alternative examples would have been with इर् [[7.1.101]] as शिशिरतुः दिदिरतुः and उर् [[8.2.77]] as पिपुरतुः ॥ Some say this <i>sutra</i> is unnecessary. The above forms like वि शश्रतुः, विशश्रुः, &c. can be regularly obtained from the roots श्रा 'to cook', द्रा 'to abuse', and प्रा 'to fill' and as the roots have many other senses, besides those assigned to them in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, the roots श्रा, द्रा and प्रा will give the meanings of शॄ, दॄ and पॄ ॥ If that were so, the form विशशृवान् with the affix क्वसु could not be formed, for we should have either विशशर्वान् from शॄ root or विशश्रिवान् from श्रा root but never विशशृवान् ॥ So the rule about shortening is necessary.",

Objection: The present <i>sutra</i> would not be useless, for it will find scope where there is no shortening of the <i>upasarjana</i> by [[1.2.48]]: namely before non-feminine affixes, as बहुयवागूकः; but there should be shortening in feminine affixes.  Answer: The shortening of [[1.2.48]] will not take place before कप् affix. Because the कप् affix will first be added to the second member in the sense of the compound, and then the word so ending in कप् will be compounded with the first member. So there is no <i>pratipadika</i> left which ends in a feminine affix, and therefore [[1.2.48]], does not apply, because the <i>pratipadika</i> now left is one ending in the affix कप् and not in a feminine affix.",

    "74054": "The मी includes मीनाति (<i>Kryadi</i> 4), and मिनोति (मि of <i>Svadi</i> 4) for मि assumes the form मी by [[6.4.16]].

    "74058": "The examples are given under the above-mentioned <i>sutras</i>. The word 'of the reduplicate' अभ्यासस्य is to be supplied in all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto the end of the chapter. Thus <i>Sutra</i> [[7.4.59]], says 'a short is to be substituted', we must supply the words 'for the reduplicate' to complete the sense: as डुढौकिषते, तुत्रौकिषते ॥ The word अत्र in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the reduplication is not to be elided, when an affix is treated like सन् but is not actually सन् ॥ Thus चङ्-Aorist is treated like सन् by [[7.4.93]]; but the reduplication will not be dropped there : as, अमीमपत्, अदीदपत् ॥ Some say the word अत्र here indicates that the whole of the reduplicate is dropped, and not only its final letter.

See [[6.1.12]] <i>Vartika</i>. This augment when added to the reduplicate, is not to be shortened by this rule: and because this is not to be shortened, also indicates that the consonants of the reduplicate other than the first are also not dropped: as चराचरः, चलाचलः, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥",
    "74060": "As जग्लौ, मम्लौ, पपाच, पपाठ, आट, आटतुः, आटुः ॥ This rule ordains the retention of the initial consonant, if any, and elision of the non-initials in the reduplicate. If the root begins with a vowel as अट्, there being no initial consonant, in अट् अट्, the ट् will be elided of course. The word हलादिः should not be construed as a Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> 'first among the consonants', for then in अक्ष् + लिट् = अक्ष् अक्ष्, the ष् only would be elided, and क् retained.\n\nThe word शेषः or शिष्यते here means अवस्थाप्यते 'is retained'. The word हलादिः is not a compound. For had it been a compound, then if it is a <i>Karmadharaya</i>, the word आदिः should stand first ; if it be a Genitive compound then the first among compound consonants would be retained and we could not get the form आनक्ष from अक्ष. The word <i>abhyasa</i> is to be taken in the sense of <i>jati</i> or kind, i.e. in the <i>jati</i> which is collectively called <i>abhyasa</i>, the consonant that stands first in respect to <i>abhyasa</i>, is retained, and not the consonant standing in any other portion of it. So that all consonants, where ever they may be situated in the body of an <i>abhyasa</i>, whether in the beginning or middle or end, are dropped, except one with which the <i>abhyasa</i> begins. Thus if the <i>abhyasa</i> begins with a simple consonant, it is retained; if it begins with a conjunct consonant, the first is only retained; and if the consonant or consonants are not in the beginning they are all dropped.\n\nOthers say, the word शेषः here means \"retention along with the cessation of others\". Therefore, though literally the word शेषः or retention appears to be the principal word in this <i>sutra</i>, yet as a matter of fact, it is secondary, because the injunction is not with regard to retention, but with regard to cessation. The rule is not \"Retain the first consonant\"; but \"Drop every consonant but the first, is there be a first consonant\". Or the <i>sutras</i> 59 and 60, may be combined and read thus : ह्रस्वोऽहल् \"The <i>abhyasa</i> becomes short and also without consonant\". आदिशेषः \"The first consonant is retained\". Or the <i>sutras</i> may be divided thus :-\n\n(1) 'A short vowel is substituted in the <i>abhyasa</i>'.\n\n(2) 'The consonants of <i>abhyasa</i> are all elided'.\n\n(3) The first is retained.\n\nThe <i>sutras</i> 59 and 60 must be joined by <i>sandhi</i> \"ह्रस्वोऽहलादिशेषः\", and then we shall be able to read an elided अ between ह्रस्वः and हल्, as if it was a compound of ह्रस्व and अहल् ॥",

The substitute does not replace the अ of the reduplicate. Why do we say 'of अ'? The substitute should not replace the final letter, which it otherwise would have done by (I. I. 52). The त् in उत् debars <i>guna</i> [[7.3.86]] in चंचूर्ति and पंफुलीति, for though उ is lengthened by [[8.2.77]], in चंचूर्ति, yet that lengthening is considered as non-existent or <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]] for the purposes of <i>Guna</i> [[7.3.86]].

The rule does not apply to roots ending in long ॠ as, चाकर्ति, चाकीर्तः, चाकिरति from कॄ ॥ The word ऋतः qualifies the word अङ्ग and not the word अभ्यास, for an <i>abhyasa</i> is always short, so the त् in ऋत् would become meaningless if the word qualified reduplicate.

    "74093": "The words of this <i>sutra</i> require a little detailed explanation. The word सन्वत् means \"like unto सन् or Desiderative\"; i. e. as the Desiderative is treated, so should the चङ् Aorist of the Causative. The words लघुनि and चङ्परे are both in the Locative case, but not in apposition with each other, but refer to different objects. लघुनि means 'when a light vowel follows', namely that reduplicate which is followed by the light root-vowel. The operations to be performed on such a reduplicate, in the चङ् Aorist, after the णि are the same, as on the reduplicate of the Desiderative. अन्-अक्-लोपे \"provided that a simple vowel of the <i>Pratyahara</i> अक् has not been elided\". We read the word 'causative' into this <i>sutra</i>, because there can be no other root which will form चङ् Aorist. Causatives form such Aorist. [[3.1.48]], as well as the simple roots श्रि, द्रु and स्रु ॥ The words चङ्परे qualifies the word अङ्ग understood: that stem which is followed by चङ्; therefore, it refers to the Causative stem, and not to the simple roots <i>sri</i>, <i>dru</i> and <i>sru</i>. The light vowel, therefore refers, to the light vowel of the Causative stem before चङ् ॥\n\nThe word अनग्लोपे is in apposition with चङ्परे ॥ Thus कम् + णिङ् [[3.1.30]] = अकाम् + इ + अत् [[3.1.48]] = अकाम् + अत् [[6.4.51]] = अकम् + अत् [[7.4.1]] = अचकम् + अत् [[6.1.11]] = आचकम् + अत् ([[7.4.79]] read with [[7.4.93]]) = अचीकमत् [[7.4.94]].\n\nThus [[7.4.79]] teaches the substitution of  इ for अ in the reduplicate of the Desiderative. The same substitution will take place in the reduplicate of the Aorist: as अचीकरत्, अपीपचत् ॥ Thus by [[7.4.80]], इ is substituted for the उ of the reduplicate in the Desiderative, the same will be the case in the reduplicate of the Aorist, as अपीपवत् and अलीलवत्, and अजीजवत् ॥ Thus by [[7.4.81]], इ is optionally substituted for उ in the Desiderative reduplicate of स्रु &c, the same will hold good in the Aorist-reduplicate, as असिस्रवत् or अस्रुस्रवत्, अशिश्रवत् or अशुश्रवत्, अदिद्रवत् or अदुद्रवत्, अपिप्रवत् or अपुप्रवत्, अपिप्लवत् or अपुप्लवत्, अचिच्यवत् or अचुच्यवत् ॥ Why do we say 'having a light vowel'? Observe अततक्षत्, अररक्षत्, अजजागरत् ॥\n\nSome say, that in अजजागरत्, the syllable ग is light, and therefore, the <i>san</i>-<i>vat</i> rule would apply : for a light vowel no where immediately follows a reduplicate; therefore, though a long syllable जा intervenes, yet the rule will apply, because of the express text. This reasoning is wrong. The maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेनव्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात् cannot be extended to cases like this. It applies only when the intervention consists of one letter and not of more than one. Objection: If so, how do you form अचिक्षणत् for here two letters क् and ष् (क्ष) intervene between the reduplicate and the light vowel. Answer: The author indicates by implication in [[7.4.95]] that these roots like क्षण् do take इ in the reduplicate; for had it not been so, what was the necessity of making an exception in favor of roots like स्मृ, त्वर, स्तॄ, स्पश् in [[7.4.95]]. So that a conjunct consonant is not considered an intervention for the purposes of this rule. Therefore, स्मृ &c would have taken इ in the reduplicate by [[7.4.79]], read with the present <i>sutra</i>, and so the <i>Acharya</i> enjoins अ instead in [[7.4.95]] with regard to these.\n\nWhy do we say 'when चङ् follows'? Observe अहं पपच ॥ Why do we use the word पर \"followed by\"? The rule would not apply when चङ् alone follows णि, as अचकमत् where कम् has taken चङ् under the <i>vartika</i> कमेरुपसंख्यानम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when an अक् vowel has not been dropped'? Observe अचकथत् from the <i>Churadi</i> root कथ which ends in अ, and this अ is elided by [[6.4.48]]. Objection: This <i>lopa</i> being considered <i>sthanivat</i>, will prevent the application of the present rule, as there will be an intervention. Answer: We shall give another example, अददृषत् from दृषदमाख्यातवान् ॥ Here णिच् is added to दृषत् under the <i>Vartika</i> तत्करोतितदाचष्टे, and the टि portion is elided by इष्टवद्भावः, here a vowel and a consonant have been elided, and so the <i>lopa</i> is not <i>sthanivat</i>.\n\nIn the double causative Aorist अवीवदत् the present rule applies, though one णि has been elided. अवीवदत् = वादितवन्तं प्रयोजितवान् ॥ In fact, the elision of one णि when followed by another णि is not considered as an <i>ak</i>-<i>lopa</i>; the latter refers to the elision of any other vowel than णि ॥ Therefore we have अवीवदद् वीणां परिवादकेन ॥ In fact, this exception rests on the following <i>vartika</i> सम्बद्भावदीर्घत्वे णे र्णिच्युपसंख्यानम् ॥\n\nThe <i>lopa</i> of the reduplicate which takes place before सन् of the roots मी, मा &c [[7.4.54]] does not, however, take place in चङ् Aorist. The analogy does not extend so far. In fact, the present <i>sutra</i> teaches a रूपातिदेश, namely the form which a reduplicate has in Desiderative, will be the form in the Aorist. But as मी, मा &c have no reduplicate form in the Desiderative, the analogy stops. Therefore, we shall have अमीमपत् ॥ Moreover the word सन्वद् here means the operations that depend solely on सन् ॥ Now the total elision of the reduplicate by [[7.4.54]] does not depend upon सन् alone, but upon the augment इस् also of [[7.4.54]]. But as there can be no इस् in the Aorist, so there will be no elision also. In fact, an <i>atidesa</i> should be confined to general cases and not to particulars.",
    "74094": "Thus अचीकरत्, the इ [[7.4.79]] is lengthened. Similarly अजीहरत्, अलीलवत्, अपीपवत् ॥ Why do we say which is prosodially light? Observe अबिभ्रजत् ॥ Why do we say when the vowel of the root is light? Observe अततक्षत्, अररक्षत् ॥ Why do we say in the reduplicated Aorist? Observe अहं पपच ॥ The word पर is understood here also, so the rule will not apply to simple roots as अचकमत् ॥ The words '<i>anaglope</i>' are to be read here, therefore not so in अचकथत् ॥",
    "74095": "Thus असस्मरत्, अददरत्, अतत्वरत्, अपप्रथत्, अमम्रदत्, अपस्पशत् ॥ This debars the इ which would have come under [[7.4.93]]. The short अ indicates that it is not to be lengthened by [[7.4.94]], as अददरत् ॥",
    "74096": "Thus अववेष्टत् or अविवेष्टत्, अचचेष्टत् and अचिचेष्टत् ॥ In one alternative there is shortening of the reduplicate [[7.4.59]], and after such shortening, there is अ substituted in the other alternative.",
    "74097": "As अजीगणत् or अजगणत् ॥ गण is a root which ends in अ, and this अ being elided by [[6.4.48]] before the Causative णि, the rule [[7.4.93]], does not apply to it, because there is an <i>ak</i>-<i>lopa</i> here, so in the other alternative, it has its natural अ ॥",
    "81001": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. Whatever will be taught hereafter upto पदस्य [[8.1.16]] exclusive, there the phrase सर्वस्य द्वे should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus [[8.1.4]] teaches \"when the sense is that of 'always', and 'each'.\" Here the phrase 'the whole word is repeated' should be supplied to complete the sense. i. e. \"The whole word is repeated when the sense is that of always and each\". What is to be repeated? That which is most appropriate in sound and sense both. Thus one पचति becomes two, as पचति पचति 'he always cooks'. Similarly ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'.\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> '<i>sarvasya</i> <i>dve</i>', should not be confounded as meaning 'the word-form <i>sarva</i> is doubled'. For then rules likes [[6.1.99]], and [[6.1.100]] will find no scope. The word <i>sarva</i> has several meanings: (1) the totality of things (द्रव्यः) as सर्वस्वं ददाति, (2) the totality of modes (प्रकारः) सर्वान्नीनोभिक्षुः = सर्वप्रकारमन्नं भक्षयति; (3) the totality of members (अवयवः), as सर्वः पटोदग्धः ॥ In the present <i>sutra</i>, the word <i>sarva</i> has this last sense: namely all the members of a word are doubled, no portion is omitted. The force of the genitive case in <i>sarvasya</i>, is that of <i>sthana</i>, i. e. in the room of the whole of the words like परि &c there is doubling. So one meaning of the <i>sutra</i> is, that in the room of the one word, two are substituted. In making such substitution, we must have regard to the rule of nearness.\n\nAnother meaning of the <i>sutra</i> however is, that it does not teach substitution but repetition or employment, not <i>adesa</i>, but <i>prayoga</i>. That is to say, one word is employed twice. In this sense, of course, there is no room left for finding out the proper substitute. The very word-form, पचति &c, is employed twice, i. e. is repeated twice or pronounced twice.\n\nThe word <i>sarvasya</i> is employed in the <i>sutra</i> for the sake of distinctness only. Otherwise, one may double only the last letter of a word by the rule of अलोऽन्तस्य, though that rule is not, strictly speaking, applicable to such cases.\n\nObjection:- The word पदस्य should be employed in the <i>sutra</i>, in order to prevent the application of the rule to <i>Samasa</i> (compound), to <i>taddhitas</i>, and to <i>vakyas</i> (sentences). Thus सप्तपर्णोऽष्टापदम् ॥ Here there is the sense of <i>vipsa</i> with regard to seven leaves, and does not mean a tree having seven leaves. There ought to have been doubling; but it would not take place, if we take the word <i>padasya</i> in the aphorism. Similarly द्विपदिकां ददाति, here also the sense is that of <i>vipsa</i>, and there ought to have been doubling, before the affixing of the <i>taddhita</i> affix. So also in ग्रामे ग्रामे पानीयम् the sentence ग्रामे पानीयम् is not doubled, if we employ <i>padasya</i>. So the word <i>padasya</i>, should be employed in the <i>sutra</i>. Moreover, it would prevent our employing the word <i>padasya</i> again in [[8.1.16]].\n\nAnswer:- We could not employ the word <i>padasya</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, for then the rule would become very much restricted. Moreover in the above examples, there can be no doubling; for सप्तपर्णः means 'that whose every twig bears seven leaves पर्वणि पर्वणि सप्तपर्णानि अस्य : so that the sense of <i>vipsa</i> is not here inherent in the word <i>sapta</i> or <i>parna</i>. In the case of the <i>taddhita</i> example, there would be no doubling, because the force of <i>vipsa</i> is there denoted by the <i>taddhita</i> affix itself, and so doubling is not necessary. Moreover, a sentence can never be doubled, because <i>vipsa</i> can take place with regard to a word, and not a sentence. Therefore the word पदस्य should not be employed in the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nOn the contrary, if we employ the word <i>padasya</i> in the <i>sutra</i>, it would give rise to the following anomalies. We could not have प्रपचति प्रपचति; for <i>upasarga</i> being considered as a separate <i>pada</i>, only पचति would be doubled, and प्र would not. So also, we have two forms द्रोग्धा and द्रोढा ॥ Here तृच् is added to the root दुह्, and ह is optionally changed to घ by [[8.2.77]], and in the other alternative there is ढ ॥ As घ and ढ are both <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]], the doubling would take place without making this घ or ढ substitution. So that having first doubled the word (something as द्रोह्ता द्रोह्ता) then optional घ or ढ change will take place, and we shall get wrong forms, like द्रोग्धा द्रोढा, द्रोढा द्रोग्धा in doubling. While the correct forms are द्रोढा द्रोढा, or द्रोग्धा द्रोग्धा, and not the hybrid doubling as given above. Hence the necessity of the <i>vartika</i> पूर्वत्रासिद्धीयमद्विर्वचने (See [[8.2.3]] last <i>vartika</i>).\n\nOr the word सर्व may be considered to be formed by अच् affix of अर्श आद्यच्, meaning सर्वं कार्यं यस्मिन्नस्ति तदिदं सर्व, तस्य द्वे भवतः ॥ That is, all operations having been first performed, then the word is doubled; so that a word in its inchoate state is not doubled.",
    "81002": "Thus in चौर चौर ३, वृषल वृषल ३ दस्यो ३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा, बन्धयिष्यामि त्वा, the second word being <i>amredita</i> is <i>pluta</i>. The word आम्रेडित occurs in <i>Sutras</i> [[6.1.99]], [[7.1.57]], [[8.2.95]], (VIII. 10. 3) &c.\n\nThe तस्य here denotes <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i>: and the word परः denotes the <i>avayava</i>. In fact, this sutra<i> indicates by implication, that a Genitive case is employed, when a member (</i>avayava<i>) is denoted. So that the sentences like पूर्वं कायस्य become valid.\n\nIn the above examples, the word has become </i>pluta_ by [[8.2.95]].",
    "81003": "Thus भुङ्क्ते भु॒॒॒ङ्क्ते॒॒; पशून् प॒॒शू॒॒न् ॥\n\nThat is, all the vowels of the <i>amredita</i> become <i>anudatta</i> or accentless. In the above examples, the root भूञ् becomes <i>atmanepadi</i> by [[1.3.66]]: the Personal endings are <i>anudatta</i> by [[6.1.186]]; the <i>vikarana</i> शनम् gets the acute by [[3.1.3]]; the अ꣡ of this न꣡ is elided by [[6.4.111]], and thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ becomes finally acute by <i>udatta</i>-<i>nivrtti</i>-<i>svara</i> [[6.1.161]]. The <i>amredita</i> <i>bhunkte</i> becomes wholly <i>anudatta</i>. The word पशु is formed by the affix कु and is finally acute.",
    "81004": "What words express 'always'? The finite verbs, and the Indeclinable words, formed by <i>krit</i> affixes. What 'always' is meant here? The word '<i>nitya</i>' here means 'again and again', and this idea of 'repetition' is the quality of an action. That action which the agent does principally, without cessation, is called \"<i>nitya</i>\". So that <i>nitya</i> refers to an action (See [[3.4.22]]). Thus पचति पचति 'he cooks continually'. जल्पति जल्पति 'he talks incessantly'. भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति or भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'each one, when he has eaten goes away.' See [[3.4.22]]. लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति (See III. 4. 2). The affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> formed words and the Imperative mood express the idea of 'again and again', only when they are repeated. While the words formed with the affix यङ् (Intensive) express this idea by the inherent force of the affix, without repetition. Thus पुनः पुनः पचति = पापच्यते ॥ And when this intensive action is continually done, then this word also should be repeated; as पापच्यते पापच्यते ॥ In the above, examples have been given of <i>nitya</i>, as illustrated by finite verbs like पचति, Indeclinable <i>krit</i> words like भुक्त्वा, and like भोजं ॥ Now for वीप्सा ॥ In what words the वीप्सा is found ? It is found in nouns (सुप् formed words). As finite verbs (तिङ्) express <i>nitya</i>, so inflected nouns (सुप्) express <i>vipsa</i> or a distributive sense. What is meant by the word <i>vipsa</i>? It is the wish of the agent to pervade (<i>vyaptum</i> <i>ichchha</i>) an object through and through with a certain quality or action. That is, when many objects are wished to be pervaded by the speaker, with a particular attribute or action simultaneously, it is <i>vipsa</i>. Thus ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'. So also जनपदो जनपदो रमणीयः पुरुषः पुरुषो निधनमुपैति ॥\n\nWhen a finite verb is repeated owing to the idea of <i>nityata</i>; and we also wish to add to such a verb the affix denoting comparative or superlative degree, such affix must be added after the word has been repeated, as पचति पचतितराम् ॥ But in the case of a noun, which is repeated owing to <i>vipsa</i>, the whole superlative or comparative word should be repeated, as आढ्यतरमाढ्यतरमानय ॥",
    "81005": "As परि परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः [[1.4.88]] and [[2.3.10]] 'It rained round about (but with the exclusion of) <i>Trigarta</i>'. Similarly परि परि सौवीरेभ्यः, परि परि सर्वसेनेभ्यः ॥ Why do we say when meaning exclusion? Observe ओदनं परिषिञ्चति ॥\n\nVart:- Optionally परि, meaning 'exclusion', is repeated when it occurs not in a compound, as परि परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यः or परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यः ॥ In a compound, there is no repetition as परित्रिगर्त्तं वृष्टोदेवः, because the word परि has not the meaning of exclusion only here; in fact, the whole compound word denotes here the idea of exclusion, and not the word परि alone.\n\nThe word परि is here a <i>Karmapravachaniya</i> [[1.4.88]], and governs the fifth case by [[2.3.11]].

    "81009": "The making it a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is for the sake of eliding the case-affix, and treating the word as a masculine, even when it refers to a feminine. Thus ए꣡कैकमक्षरं पठति (not एकमेकम्), ए꣡कैकयाहुत्या जुहोति (not एकयैकया). The accent is regulated by [[6.2.1]]. the case-affix is elided by [[2.4.71]], and masculinising by [[6.3.34]]. This double word एकैक should not however be treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> for the purposes of the application of the following three rules, (1) The <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]] by which pronouns are not declined as pronouns when members of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound. The word एकैक however is declined like a Pronoun, as एकैकस्मै ॥ For <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]] applies to a compound which is really a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, and not to a word-form which is treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. The repetition of the word <i>Bahuvrihi</i> in that <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was understood from the preceding one; indicates this. (2) The application of the rule of accent. Thus by the following <i>sutra</i>, a word is repeated when a mental pain or affliction over something is expressed. Thus न न करोति, सुसुजागर्ति ॥ This double-word is treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, but not for the purposes of accent. For by [[6.2.172]] a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> preceded by न or सु gets acute on the final, but not so नन or सुसु ॥ Here four rules of accent present themselves Ist [[6.1.223]] ordaining acute on the final, 2nd [[6.2.1]] the first member retaining its accent, 3rd [[6.2.172]] already mentioned, 4th [[8.1.3]] by which the second member becomes <i>anudatta</i>. The rule [[6.2.1]] however regulates the accent, in supersession of the other three. (3) The third rule which does not apply to this <i>Bahuvrihi</i>-<i>vat</i> एकैक is the rule of <i>samasanta</i> affixing. Thus ऋक् ॠक्, पूः पूः (doubled by [[8.1.10]]) do not get the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ by [[5.4.74]].",

    "81011": "The reason for making it a <i>Karmadharaya</i> is to elide the case-affix [[2.4.71]], to make the first member a masculine term even when the word refers to a feminine [[6.3.42]], and to regulate the accent by [[6.1.223]]. Thus पटुपटुः, मृदुमृदुः where the first member has lost the case-affix. पटुपट्वी, मृदुमृद्वी where the first member is treated as a masculine, even when there is a क in the penultimate as कालककालिका (See [[6.3.37]] and [[6.3.42]]; पटुपटुः꣡, पटुपट्वी꣡, the accent falls on the final, for the rule (VI.

The word उत्तरेषु is for the sake of distinctness, the <i>sutra</i> being an <i>adhikara</i> one, would have applied to the subsequent aphorisms, without even the word <i>uttareshu</i>.",
    "81012": "The word प्रकार means both 'difference' and 'resemblance'. It means 'resemblance' here: i.e. the person or thing resembles, but is not fully like, the thing expressing the attribute. Thus पटुपटुः꣡, 'tolerably sharp', मृदुमृदुः꣡ \"pretty soft\", पण्डितपण्डितः꣡ &c. The sense is that the attribute is not fully possessed by the person. The affix जातयिर् [[5.3.69]] also expressing प्रकार, is not debarred by this <i>sutra</i>. Thus पटुजातीयः, मृदुजातीयः ॥\n\nWhy do we say <i>prakare</i> \"when denoting somewhat like it\"? Observe पटुर्देवदत्तः 'the clever <i>Devadatta</i>'. Why do we say 'an attributive or adjective word'? Observe अग्निर्माणवकः, 'a fiery boy', गौर्वाहीकः 'a cow-like <i>Bahika</i>'. Here '<i>agni</i>' and '<i>gau</i>' are not naturally adjective words, though employed here like adjectives. \n\nVart:- An adjective is repeated when denoting that persons or things possessing that attribute are to be taken in their due order. Thus मूले मूले स्थूलाः, अग्रे अग्रे सूक्ष्माः, ज्येष्ठं ज्येष्ठं प्रवेशयः ॥\n\nVart:- A word denoting more than one is repeated without change of sense, when it denotes the limit or extent of the thing. Thus अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषं माषं देहि 'give a <i>masha</i>, a <i>masha</i> out of this <i>karshapana</i> to you two': i. e. give only two <i>masha</i> one to each. A <i>karshapana</i> contains many <i>mashas</i>, out of them, the extent of gift is limited to two only. This therefore is distinguishable from the distributive double (<i>vipsa</i>). The words माषं माषं देहि = द्वौ देहि; the माष does not take the dual case here. Why do we say 'when it expresses the limit'? Observe अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषमेकं देहि, द्वौ माषौ देहि, त्रीन्वा माषान् देहि. Here the word माष itself does not express limit, but the qualifying words एकं, द्वौ, त्रीन् &c. Why do we say 'denoting more than one'? Observe अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषमेकं देहि ॥\n\nVart:- In expressing perplexity or alarm, a word may be repeated twice. The word चापल in the <i>vartika</i> means 'a confused state of mind'. As अहिरहिः बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व 'a snake, a snake, beware. beware'. It is not a necessary condition that the word should be repeated twice only, but as many times as one likes, so long as his meaning is not manifest. As : अहिः अहिः अहिः, बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व ॥\n\nVart:- When intensity or frequency of an action is denoted, the word is uttered twice: as, स भवान् लुनीहि लुनीहि इत्येवायं लुनाति ॥ See [[3.4.2]].\n\nVart:- In re-iteration the word is doubled; as, भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति, भोजं भोजं व्रजति ॥ See [[3.4.22]]. This has also been illustrated under [[8.1.4]].\n\nVart:- The word is repeated when the affix डाच् follows; as, पटपटा करोति, पटपटायते ॥ This doubling takes place when the word denotes an imitation of an inarticulate sound [[5.4.57]]. Therefore, not here, द्वितीया करोति, तृतीया करोति, where the affix डाच् denotes 'to plough', [[5.4.58]]. Because of this restriction, some read the <i>vartika</i> as, डाचि बहुलम् ॥\n\nVart:- The words पूर्व and प्रथम are repeated when a comparative or superlative sense is to be denoted: as पूर्वं पूर्वं पुष्प्यन्ति, प्रथमं प्रथमं पच्यन्ते ॥ The comparative and superlative affixes are not debarred hereby, as, पूर्वतरं पुष्प्यन्ति, प्रथमतरं पच्यन्ते ॥\n\nVart:- The words ending in the affixes उत्तर and उत्तम (comparative and superlative), are doubled when they refer to feminine nouns and are employed in determining or pondering upon the relative condition of the superiority of one out of two or many; as उभाविमावाढ्यौ, कतरा कतरा अनयोराढ्यता \"Both these are rich: let us ponder how much is their richness.\" सर्व इमे आढ्याः, कतमा कतमा एषामाढ्यता ॥ This is found in words other than those ending in तर and तम; as; उभाविमावाढ्यौ, किदृशी किदृशी अनयोराढ्यता ॥ This is also found where the abstract noun denoting condition (as आढ्यता) is not in the feminine: as, उभाविमावाढ्यौ, कतरः कतरोऽनयोर्विभवः \"Both these are rich, let us see what is their respective greatness.\"\n\nVart:- In denoting reciprocity of action, the Pronominal is doubled; and diversely it is treated like a compound [[2.2.27]] when it is not treated like a compound, then the first word is always exhibited in the nominative singular. See [[1.3.14]], [[3.3.43]], and [[5.4.127]]. Thus अन्यमन्यमिमे ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति \"these <i>Brahmanas</i> feed one another.\" अन्योन्यमिमे ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति ॥ अन्योऽन्यस्य ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति = इतरेतरान् भोजयन्ति ॥ The word अन्य and पर are never treated as a compound, and इतर is always so treated. The following are from <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>:- अन्योऽन्यौ, अन्योऽन्यान् अन्योऽन्येनकृतं, अन्योऽन्यस्मैदत्तं, अन्योऽन्येषां पुष्करैरामृशन्ते (<i>Magh</i>) परस्परं ॥\n\nVart:- In the feminine and neuter, the augment आम् is added optionally to the second term under the above circumstances, as, अन्योऽन्यामिमे ब्राह्मण्यौ भोजयतः, अन्योऽन्यं भोजयतः, इतरेतरां भोजयतः, इतरेतरं भोजयतः ॥ अन्योऽन्यामिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः, इतरेतरामिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः, इतरेतरमिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः ॥",
    "81013": "The word कृच्छ्र means 'difficulty and sorrow', अकृच्छ्र means 'without difficulty or sorrow, i.e. pleasantly'. Thus प्रियप्रियेण ददाति, सुखसुखेन ददाति, or प्रियेण ददाति, सुखेन ददाति = अतिप्रियमपि वस्त्व नायासेन ददाति ॥ That is, he gives with pleasure, without feeling it as a trouble. Why do we say \"when meaning easily\"? Observe प्रियः पुत्र: \"beloved son\". सुखी रथः ॥",
    "81014": "What is one's own nature, and whatever is natural to one, that is called यथास्व ॥ In this sense is formed यथायथ꣡म् there being doubling and neuter gender. It is an Indeclinable. As ज्ञाताः सर्वे पदार्था यथायथम् = यथास्वभावं \"all objects have been known according to their respective nature\". सर्वेषां तु यथायथं यथास्मीयं ॥",
    "81015": "The word द्वन्द्वं is formed from द्वि by doubling it, changing the first द्व into अम्, and the second द्व into अ ॥ The word द्वन्द्व itself means रहस्य or secret; while it marks 'limit' मर्यादा &c only secondarily, by context of the sentence. Thus द्वन्द्वं मन्त्रयन्ते 'they are consulting some secret'. Limit or मर्यादावचनः, as आचतुरं हीमे पशवो द्वन्द्वं मिथुनायन्ते = माता पुत्रेण मिथुनं गच्छति, पौत्रेण, तत्पुत्रेणापि ॥ (See <i>Maitr</i>. <i>S</i>. 1. 7. 3 <i>Sankh</i>. <i>Br</i>. III. 97). Separation of व्युत्क्रमण :- द्वन्द्वयुत्क्रान्ताः = द्विवर्गसम्बन्धेन पृथगवस्थिताः ॥ <i>Vyutkramana</i> means <i>bheda</i> or separation, placing at a different place. Employment with regard to a sacrificial vessel (यज्ञपात्रप्रयोगः) as — द्वन्द्वं यज्ञपात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति वीरः (See [[1.3.64]]) ॥ अभिव्यक्तिः or manifestation : as द्वन्द्वं नारदपर्वतौ, द्वन्द्वं संकर्षण वासुदेवौ = द्वावप्यभिव्यक्तौ साहचर्येण ॥\n\nThe word द्वन्द्वं is found employed in connection with other senses also; as द्वन्द्वं युद्धं वर्त्तते, द्वन्द्वानि सहते धीरः, चार्थे द्वन्द्वः &c.",
    "81016": "This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>, and extends up to [[8.3.55]]. Whatever we shall treat of here-after, should be understood to apply to a full '<i>pada</i>' or a completed word. Thus [[8.2.23]], (संयोगान्तस्य लोपः) teaches \"there is elision of the final of what ends in a conjunct consonant\". The word पदस्य must be supplied here to complete the sense : viz, of a word which ends in a conjunct consonant, the final is elided. Thus पचन्, यजन्, from पचन्त् and यजन्त् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of a <i>Pada</i>'? Observe पचन्तौ, यजन्तौ where the त् though <i>sanyoganta</i> is not elided, because the stem is no longer called <i>pada</i>. The force of the Genitive in पदस्य must be construed according to the context, sometimes as <i>sthana</i>-<i>shashthi</i> i.e. \"in the room of the whole <i>pada</i>\"; and sometimes as <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i> i.e. \"of a <i>pada</i>-of the portion of a <i>pada</i> \".",
    "81017": "Whatever we shall teach hereafter should be understood to apply to that which comes after a <i>pada</i>. Thus the <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.19]], teaches \"of an <i>amantrita</i>\". The phrase पदात्, must be supplied to complete the sense. That is, \"of a <i>pada</i>, which is in the Vocative case, and which comes after another <i>pada</i>, all vowels become <i>anudatta</i>\". Thus पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त \"Cookest thou, <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i>\". Why do we say, \"after a <i>pada</i>\"? Observe देवदत्त पचसि ॥ Here <i>Devadatta</i> is not <i>anudatta</i> [[6.1.198]].",
    "81018": "The three words <i>anudattam</i> \"unaccented \", <i>sarvam</i> \"the whole\", and <i>apadadau</i> \"not in the beginning of a <i>Pada</i> of a verse\", should be understood to exert a governing influence over all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> of this chapter, upto its end. Whatever we shall treat of hereafter, must be understood to be wholly unaccented, provided that, it does not stand as the first word of a verse or stanza. Thus [[8.1.19]], says \"of a Vocative \". The whole of this <i>sutra</i> should be read there to complete the sense, viz: \"all the syllables of a Vocative are unaccented when a word precedes it, and it does not stand as the first word of a hemistich\"; as पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not at the beginning of a hemistich\"? Observe यत्ते नियतं रजसं मृत्यो अनवधृष्ण्यम्, here मृत्यो though in the Vocative case, is not <i>anudatta</i>, as it stands at the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>.\n\nSimilarly (VIII. I. 21), teaches \"वः and नः are the substitutes of युष्मद् अस्मद् in the plural\". The present <i>sutra</i> must be read there to complete the sense, viz, when not at the beginning of a verse. Thus ग्रामोवः स्वं, जनपदो नः स्वम् ॥ But at the beginning of a hemistich, we must have the forms युष्माकं and अस्माकं instead of वः and नः ॥ As,\n\nरुद्रो विश्वेश्वरो देवो युष्माकं कुलदेवता ।\nस एव नाथो भगवानस्माकं शत्रुमर्दनः ॥\n\nThe word पाद् in the <i>sutra</i> refers both to the hemistiches of the sacred <i>Rik</i> hymns, as well as to secular <i>slokas</i>.\n\nQuestion: Why do we employ the word सर्वं in the <i>sutra</i>?\n\nAnswer:- The word <i>sarvam</i> is used in the <i>sutra</i>, in order to indicate that a word, which has not acute accent on the first syllable, should also become <i>anudatta</i>. For the word पदात् [[8.1.17]] is in the ablative case, and shows that the operation taught in any <i>sutra</i> governed by it, will be performed on the first syllable, according to the maxim आदेः परस्य ॥ Therefore, by rule [[8.1.28]], the word प꣡चति, which is acutely accented on the first syllable, (because शप् and तिप् are <i>anudatta</i>), will only lose its accent in देवदत्तः पचति; but not so the verb करोति which is acutely accented in the middle (by the <i>vikarana</i> accent) in देवदत्तः करोति ॥ But by force of the word सर्वं, करोति also loses its accent.\n\nQuestion: This cannot be the reason, for the author indicates by his prohibition in <i>Sutra</i> [[8.1.29]], that a verb loses its accent, where ever that accent may be. For there is no verb when conjugated in लुट् which has acute on the first syllable.\n\nAnswer:- The word '<i>sarvam</i>' is used to prevent the operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधिः; for where the rule आदेः परस्य will not apply there the other will apply: so that, if \"<i>sarvam</i>\" was not used, the rule would apply to the finals, and not to cases where there were other than initials to be operated upon. Thus the rule [[8.1.28]] would apply to कुरुतः꣡ which is finally acute by [[6.1.186]], in देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ कु॒॒रु॒॒तः॒॒, but not to देवदत्तः करोति ॥\n\nQuestion: No; this cannot be the reason of employing the word '<i>sarvam</i>' in the <i>sutra</i>, for the author indicates that the rule is not confined to the finals, by the prohibition he makes in favor of लृट् in [[8.1.51]]; for there is no verb, when conjugated in <i>Lrit</i>, which has acute on the final. All <i>Lrit</i> is acute in the middle by [[6.1.186]]. So the अलोऽन्त्यस्य rule does not apply.\n\nAnswer:- The word '<i>sarvam</i>:' is used for this reason. Had '<i>sarvam</i>', not been used, then in those cases where there was no other rule to apply, like [[8.1.19]], there only the word would become <i>anudatta</i>. But in cases where another rule also operated, there this <i>anudatta</i> rule would not apply, for then there would be two different sentences. For a thing which is already in existence can be made the subject of a rule ordering certain operations to be performed on it; but not so a thing which will come in existence in future time. Thus the words वां and नौ are ordained as substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> by one sentence [[8.1.20]]; while another sentence ordains their <i>anudatta</i>-hood. So here there is separation of sentences (<i>vakya</i>-<i>bheda</i>): which is not desireable; for a <i>vakya</i> <i>bheda</i> should be avoided, if possible. But by employing the word '<i>sarvam</i>:', this <i>vakya</i>-<i>bheda</i> is made tolerable.\n\nAnother reason for employing this word is that the substitutes वां and नौ should come in the room of the whole declined forms of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, with their case-affixes. Had not this word (<i>sarvam</i>) been used, then वां and नौ would have replaced only '<i>yushmad</i>' and '<i>asmad</i>'. Objection:- Will not the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>padasya</i>', cause the whole declined word to be replaced by वां and नौ, not only the crude-forms <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>? And there cannot be a full word unless it takes case-affixes; so the whole of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> with their case-affixes will be replaced. Where is the necessity of using the word '<i>sarvam</i>'? Answer:- This objection will apply to those cases where a <i>Pada</i> is a word ending in a case-affix. But the word पद is a technical term also, and applies to crude forms before certain case-affixes. Thus a nominal stem (not a full word) is also called <i>Pada</i> by [[1.4.17]], before non-<i>sarvanamasthana</i> case-affixes. Therefore <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> will be <i>pada</i> before those affixes. Thus before the affix of Dative Dual, they will be called <i>Pada</i>; and had सर्वं not been used, then only \"<i>yushmad</i>\" and \"<i>asmad</i>\" will be replaced and not their case-affixes. Thus ग्रामो वां दीयते, जनपदो नौ दीयते ॥ Here वां and नौ would require after them the case-affix भ्यां otherwise.",
    "81019": "Thus पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒, पचसि य॒॒ज्ञ॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥ The Vocative is acutely accented on the first by [[6.1.198]], the present makes it all unaccented.\n\nVart:- The rules relating to <i>nighata</i> (by which all syllables of a word become unaccented, such as the present, and [[8.1.28]] &c) and to the substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> apply then only, when the preceding word which would cause the <i>nighata</i> or the substitution, is part of the same sentence with the latter word. Therefore not here:- अयं दण्डो, हरानेन ॥ \"This is the staff. Carry by means of it.\" Here हर does not lose its accent by (VIII. I. 28), though preceded by the Noun <i>danda</i>, because these are parts of two different sentences. ओदनं पच, तव भविष्यति । ओदनं पच, मम भविष्यति ॥ \"Cook the food, it will be for thee. Cook the food, it will be for me.\" That is the rice cooked by thee, will do both for thyself and myself. Here the ते and मे substitutions have not taken place (VIII. I. 22) for <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, for the same reason.\n\nAnother example is, भवतीह विष्णुमित्रो, देवदत्तागच्छ \"<i>Vishnumitra</i> is here, Come back <i>Devadatta</i>.\" Here <i>Devadatta</i>, though in the Vocative case, does not lose its accent. Nor can you say that समर्थः पदविधिः will make this <i>vartika</i> redundant. In all the above examples, the different sentences are connected with each other in sense. Thus in the last example, <i>Devadatta</i> was searching for <i>Vishnumitra</i>, when some one says to him, 'Here is <i>Vishnumitra</i> come back <i>Devadatta</i>.\" Thus the two sentences are <i>samartha</i>, yet there is no <i>nighata</i>. But the rule will apply here:- इह देवदत्त ! माता ते कथयति । नद्यास्तिष्ठति॑ [[8.1.28]] कूलं । शालीनां ते ओदनं दास्यामि ॥ In the last examples the Vocatives, the verbs and the substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> are not in syntactical construction with the words that immediately precede them, and yet the <i>nighata</i> rule &c does apply: inspite of the general maxim समर्थः पदविधिः [[2.1.1]], for rules relating to completed words apply to such words only which are in construction.\n\nIn the last example, the construction is इह स्थिता माता ते देवदत्त, and not इह देवदत्त. Thus इह is in syntactical construction with स्थिता and not देवदत्त, yet it causes <i>nighata</i> of <i>Devadatta</i>. Similarly in नद्यास्तिष्ठति कूलं, the word नद्याः is not in construction with तिष्ठति, but with कूलं, i.e. नद्याः कूलं तिष्ठति; yet it causes the <i>nighata</i> of तिष्ठति ॥ Similarly शालीनां is not in construction with ते, but with ओदनं, i.e. शालीनां ओदनं ते दास्यामि ॥ Yet it causes ते substitution of <i>yushmad</i>. Though the preceding words are not <i>samartha</i> with regard to the words that follow them, they cause the changes, because the words are in the same sentence.",
    "81020": "All the three <i>sutras</i> पदस्य, पदात् and अनुदात्तं सर्वमपादादौ are applicable here. Thus ग्रामो वां स्वम् । जनपदो नौ स्वम् । ग्रामो वां दीयते । जनपदो नौ दीयते । ग्रामो वां पश्यति । जनपदो नौ पश्यति ॥\nThese two वाम् and नौ come in the Dual only, because other substitutes have been taught for the Singular and Plural in the two subsequent <i>sutras</i>.\nWhy do we say \"for the Genitive, Dative and Accusative\"? In other cases there will be no substitution. As, ग्रामो युवाभ्यां कृतम् ॥ The word स्थ in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the case affixes must be express and not understood, for the purposes of this substitution. Therefore, not here: इति युष्मत्पुत्रः though here <i>yushmat</i> is preceded by a word in a sentence, and is in the Genitive case yet वः substitution [[8.1.21]] does not take place, because the case-affix is elided.",
    "81021": "Thus ग्रामो वः॒॒ स्वम्, जनपदो नः॒॒ स्वम्; ग्रामो वो॒॒ दीयते, जनपदो नो॒॒ दीयते; ग्रामो वः॒॒ पश्यति जनपदो नः॒॒ पश्यति ॥",
    "81022": "Thus ग्रामस्ते स्वम्, ग्रामो मे स्वम्, ग्रामस्ते दीयते, ग्रामो मे दीयते ॥ For the Accusative singular, other substitutes have been taught in the next <i>sutra</i>, hence ते and मे come only in Genitive and Dative.",

There is, therefore, where the conjunction is not direct but intermediate the employment of the shorter forms. As ग्रामश्च ते स्वं, नगरं च मे स्वम् ॥\n\nThe particles च, वा, &c denote conjunction, 'separation' 'wonder' &c. Where the sense of 'conjunction.' 'separation' &c are inherent in the pronouns <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, and these particles are employed to manifest that sense, there the present <i>sutra</i> will apply its prohibition.",
    "81025": "The word पश्यार्थाः is equivalent to दर्शनार्थाः, and दर्शन means 'knowledge', i.e. verbs denoting 'to know', आलोचन means perception obtained through sight i.e. physical 'seeing' opposed to metaphorical \"seeing\" = \"knowing\". The substitutions of वां and नौ &c. for युष्मद् and अस्मद् do not take place when these pronouns are employed in connection with verbs denoting 'seeing' (metaphorically) but not 'looking' (physically).\n\nThus ग्रामस्तव स्वं समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामो मम स्वं समीक्ष्यागतः; ग्रामस्तुभ्यं दीयमानं समीक्षागतः, ग्रामो मह्यं दीयमानं समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामस्त्वां समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामो मां समीक्ष्यागतः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when not meaning 'to look'? Observe ग्रामस्त्वा पश्यति, ग्रामो मा पश्यति ॥\n\n<i>Ishti</i>:- With regard to verbs of \"seeing\", the rule should apply even where the connection is not direct: as, we have already illustrated above.",

Observe कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after a Nominative\"? Observe कम्बलो ग्रामे ते स्वम्, कम्बलो ग्रामे मे स्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- The option herein taught is restricted to युष्मद् and अस्मद् when not employed in <i>anvadesa</i>. But when there is <i>anvadesa</i>, then the substitution is compulsory and not optional. This <i>vartika</i> restricts the scope of the <i>sutra</i>, and makes it a <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>. Therefore, there is no option here, where there is <i>anvadesa</i>: अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- Others say, that the substitutes वां, नौ &c are all optional, when not employed in <i>anvadesa</i>, whether the nominative is preceded by another noun or not. Thus the rules 20, 21, 22, 23 are optional. As : कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, or कम्बलस्तव स्वम्, कम्बलो मे स्वम् or कम्बलो मम स्वम् ॥ Why do we say \"when not in <i>anvadesa</i>\"? Observe अथो कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, अथो कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥ Question: If this is so, where is the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> at all? Answer:- The present <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of <i>anvadesa</i>: i.e. the option taught in the present <i>sutra</i> will take place only then, when there is <i>anvadesa</i> and not otherwise ; thus अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, or अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्तव स्वम्, अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मे स्वम्, or अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मम स्वम् ॥ In other words, according to this <i>vartika</i>, rules 20, 21, 22 and 23 are all optional in <i>anvadesa</i>, but compulsory where is no <i>anvadesa</i>; but when the pronoun is preceded by a nominative which itself is preceded by another word, then the above rules are not compulsory, even in <i>anvadesa</i>: there also the option will apply.",
    "81027": "Thus पचति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, जल्पति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, when contempt is meant.\n\nHere पचति गोत्रं means 'he proclaims his <i>Gotra</i> &c, so that he may get food &c'. पचति is from the root पचि व्यक्तिकरणे 'to make evident' (<i>Bhuadi</i> 184). Similarly जल्पति गोत्रम् \"he repeatedly utters, his descent &c, in order to get married &c\". Where contempt is not meant, it has the force of repetition, i.e. he repeatedly utters his <i>Gotra</i> as one is bound to do, in marriage-rites &c. And पचति पचति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, जल्पति जल्पति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म् when repetition or intensity is denoted. Similarly पचति ब्रुवम्, पचति पचति ब्रुवम् ॥ The word ब्रुवं is a noun derived from the root ब्रू by the affix कन्, the वच् substitution for ब्रू has not taken place, as an anomaly.\n\n1 गोत्र, 2 ब्रुव, 3 प्रवचन, 4 प्रहसन, 5 प्रकथन, 6 प्रत्ययन, 7 प्रपञ्च, 8 प्राय, 9 न्याय, 10 प्रचक्षण, 11 विचक्षण, 12 अवचक्षण, 13 स्वाध्याय, 14 भूयिष्ठ, 15 वा नाम (नाम वा) 16 प्रदशन, 17 प्रयजन.\n\nThe word नाम optionally becomes <i>anudatta</i> : in the alternative, it is first-acute. Thus पचति ना॒॒म॒॒ or पचति ना꣡म ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'after a finite verb'? Observe कुत्सितं गोत्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"<i>Gotra</i> and the rest\"? Observe पचति पापम् ॥ Here पापं is an adverb.\n\nWhy do we say 'when contempt or repetition is meant'? Observe खनति गोत्रं समेत्य कूपं ॥ \"He digs a well having assembled the <i>Gotra</i>\".\n\nThe words 'contempt and repetition' in the text qualify the whole sentence or <i>sutra</i>, and not the word गोत्रादि nor the word अनुदात्त understood. For we find that wherever the word गोत्रादि is used in this Chapter, it always implies the sense of 'contempt or repetition'. Thus the word गोत्रादि is used in [[8.1.57]] and there also the sense is of contempt and repetition.",
    "81028": "Thus देवदत्तः प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ Why do we say \"a finite verb\"? Observe नीलमुत्पलम्, शुक्लं वस्त्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when the preceding word is not a finite verb'? Observe भवति प꣡चति 'the act of cooking exists' = पाक क्रिया भवति ॥ Here the word भवति is a finite verb, therefore the verb <i>pachati</i> does not lose its accent. So also तरनिरिज् ज॒॒य॒॒ति॒॒, क्षो꣡ति, पु꣡ष्यति 'successful he conquers, rules, thrives', अस्म꣡भ्यां जे॒॒षि॒॒ यो꣡त्सिच \"for us conquer and fight\". The word अतिङः is in one sense redundant, because in one simple sentence, two finite verbs cannot be employed; one sentence consists of one finite verb only. But the very fact of this <i>sutra</i> indicates that the condition of समानवाक्य does not apply to this <i>sutra</i>; so that the two words need not be portions of the same sentence, for the application of this <i>nighata</i>: as we have already explained in [[8.1.19]]. Other examples are: are अग्निमी॒॒डे॒॒ पुरोहितं (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>. 1. 1. 1). स इद्देवेषु꣡ ग॒॒च्छ॒॒ति॒॒ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>. I. I. 4), अग्ने꣡ सूपायनो꣡ भ॒॒व॒॒ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>. V. 1. 1), य꣡जमानस्य प꣡शून् पा॒॒हि॒॒ ॥",
    "81029": "This restricts the scope of the last <i>sutra</i> which was rather too wide. Thus श्वः कर्त्ता꣡, श्वः कर्त्ता꣡रौ, मासेन कर्ता꣡रः ॥ The <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes डा, रौ, रस्, are <i>anudatta</i> after the affix तासि by (VI. I. 186), the whole affix तास् becomes <i>udatta</i> [[3.1.3]] and where the टि portion of तास् i. e. the syllable आस्, is elided before the affix डा, there also the आ of डा becomes <i>udatta</i>, because the <i>udatta</i> has been elided. See [[6.1.161]].",
    "81030": "Thus यत् क॒॒रो꣡ति, यत् प꣡चति, यदि क॒॒रो꣡ति or यदि प꣡चति, हन्त क॒॒रोति, हन्त प꣡चति, कुवित् क॒॒रोति, कुवित् प꣡चति, नेज् जिह्मायन्त्यो नरकं प꣡ताम (<i>Nir</i>. I. II), स चेद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, स चेद् अधीते꣡ ॥ The particle चण् with the indicatory ण् has the force of चेत् ॥ Thus अयं च मरिष्य꣡ति = अयं चेन् मरिष्यति ॥ Other examples are त्वम् च सोम नो व꣡शो जीवातुम् न꣡ मरामहे 'if thou, <i>Soma</i> willest us to live, we shall not die' आ꣡ च ग꣡च्छान् मित्र꣡मेना दधाम \"if he will come here, we will make friends with him.\" इन्द्रश्च मूलयाति नः, नतः पश्चादघं नशत् \"If <i>Indra</i> makes us happy &c\". This rule does not apply to the च which is a conjunction meaning 'and'. So also : कच्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, कच्चिद् अधीते꣡, यत्र भुङ्क्ते꣡, यत्राधीते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"with particles\"? Observe यत् कूजति शकटम् = गच्छत् कूजति शकटम् ॥ Here यत् is not a particle, but the Present Participle of the root इण् 'to go'. It means गच्छत् 'the car creaks while going'. Rule [[8.1.28]] applies here.\n\nQuestion: Now by the rule of <i>Pratipadokta</i> &c. that यत् should only be taken, which is a Particle; moreover it is read in connection with other Particles like यदि &c, so it must be a Particle. How then can the Present Participle यत् be taken at all? Answer:- This <i>sutra</i> indicates that the प्रतिपदोक्त rule and the साहचर्य rule do not apply here. Thus the word यावत् formed with the affix वतुप् [[5.2.39]] is also included in the word यावत् of this <i>sutra</i>. As तावदुषो राधो अस्मभ्यं, रास्व यावत् स्तोतृभ्यो अरदो गृणानाः = यावतोऽश्वान् प्रतीगृह्णीयात् ॥\n\nWhy do we use the word युक्तं \"in connection with\". Observe यत्र क्व च ते मनो दक्ष दधस उत्तरम् ॥\n\nOther examples are: यं यज्ञं परिभूर꣡सि (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> I. I. 4.) 'what offering thou protectest'. यत्र नः पूर्वे पितरः परेयुः꣡ 'whither our fathers of old departed'. अद्या मुरीय यदि यातुधानो अ꣡स्मि 'let me die on the spot, if I am a sorcerer', हन्तेयान् पृथिवीम् विभ꣡जामहै \"come on, let us share up this earth\". ब्रह्मा चेद्धस्तम् अ꣡ग्रहीत् 'if a <i>Brahman</i> has grasped her hand', नेत् त्वा त꣡पति सूरो अर्चिणा 'that the sun may not burn thee with his beam' उक्थेभिः कुविद् आग꣡मत् 'will he come hither for our praises' (Whitney's Grammar, Para 595).",
    "81031": "When something urged by one, is rejected insultingly by another, then the reply made by the first tauntingly, with a negation, is <i>pratyarambha</i>. Thus A says to B: \"Eat this please\". B rejects the offer repeatedly, in anger or jest. Then A in anger or jest says \"No, you will eat\"-as नह भोक्ष्यसे ॥ Here भोक्ष्यसे retains its accent, which is acute on the middle, for से becomes accentless as it follows अदुपदेश (VI. I. 186), and स्य becomes <i>udatta</i> by the प्रत्ययस्वर [[3.1.3]].\n\nAnother example is नहाध्येष्यसे 'No, you will study'. Why do we say, 'when asseverative? Observe नह वै त꣡स्मिंश्च लोके꣡ द꣡क्षिणमिच्छ॒॒न्ति॒॒ \"Verily in that world they do not wish for fee\". Here it is pure negation. तस्मिन् is first acute by फिट् accent, लोक꣡ is final acute because it is formed by अच् of पचादि [[3.1.134]], द꣡क्षिण is first acute, because it is a Pronoun ending in अ (स्वाङ्गशिटामदन्तानाम् <i>Phit</i> II. 6) and इच्छन्ति is <i>anudatta</i> by [[8.1.28]].",
    "81032": "Thus सत्यं भोक्ष्य꣡से 'Truly will you eat'? सत्यमध्येष्यसे ॥ Why do we say 'in questioning'? Observe सत्यं वक्ष्यामि नानृतं 'I shall tell the truth, not falsehood', स॒॒त्यमिद्वा उ॒॒ तं व॒॒यमिन्द्र॑ स्तवाम्॒॒ ॥",
    "81033": "Anything done to injure another is <i>prati</i>-<i>loma</i>, opposite of this is <i>apratiloma</i>, or friendliness. In fact, it is equal to <i>anuloma</i>. Thus अङ्ग प꣡च 'yes, you may cook', Here <i>anga</i> has the force of friendly permission. So also अङ्ग प꣡ठ ॥ But when it has the force of <i>pratiloma</i>, we have:- अङ्ग कूजा꣡ ३ वृषल ॥ इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म \"Well, chuckle O sinner! soon wilt thou learn, O coward\". Here अङ्ग is used in the sense of censure, for chuckling is a thing not liked by the person: and is <i>pratiloma</i> action: for <i>pluta</i>-vowel see [[8.2.96]].",
    "81034": "Thus स हि कुरु꣡, सहि प꣡च, सहि प꣡ठ ॥ Why do we say 'in friendly assertion'? Observe स हि कू॒॒ज वृषल । इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म ॥",
    "81035": "That is sometimes one verb, sometimes more than one verb retain their accent. Thus of more than one verb, we have the following example :- अनृतं हि मत्तो व꣡दति । पाप्मा एनं वि पु꣡नाति 'Because the drunkard tells falsehood, therefore sin will make him impure: i. e. he does incur sin'. Here both verbs वदति and विपुनाति retain their accent: and हि has the force of यत् 'because'. According to <i>Kaiyyata</i> the meaning of this sentence is यस्मान् मत्तोऽनृतं वदति, तस्मादनृतवदन दोषेण न युज्यते i. e. a drunkard does not incur the sin of telling a falsehood, because he is not in his senses. See <i>Maitr</i>. <i>Sanhita</i> I. II. 6. As regards one verb in a correlated sentence retaining its accent and the other losing it, we have:- अग्निर्हि पूर्वमुद꣡जयत् तमिन्द्रोऽमूद॒॒ज॒॒यत् ॥ Here the first retains its accent and the second not. The force of हि is to denote here cause and its effect. So also:- अजा ह्यग्नेर꣡जनिष्ट गर्भात् (or गर्भम्), सा वा अ॒॒प॒॒श्य॒॒त्॒॒ जनितारमग्रे (<i>Taittariya</i> <i>Samhita</i> IV. 2. 10, 4). The word अजनिष्ट is first acute, the augment अट् having the accent; while अपश्यत् is all <i>anudatta</i>.",
    "81036": "Thus यावद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, यथा भुङ्क्ते꣡ यावदधीते꣡ यथाधीते꣡, देवदत्तः प꣡चति यावत्, देवदत्तः प꣡चति यथा ॥ The meaning is that the verb retains its accent, even when यावत् and यथा follow after it. Another example is यथा चित् कण्वमावतम् ॥ The word आवतम् is the Imperative (लोट्) Second Person Dual of the root अव् ॥ यावत् स्तोतृभ्योऽरदोगृणानाः ॥ The verb अरदः is Imperfect (लङ्) Second Person singular of the root रद् 'to scratch'. The accent, is on अ (the augment).",
    "81037": "That is, the verb loses its accent, and becomes <i>anudatta</i>. Thus यावत् प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ शोभनम्, यथा पचति शोभनम्, यावत् करोति चारु ॥ \n\nWhy do we say when denoting 'praise'? Observe यावद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, यथा भुङ्क्ते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'immediately'? Observe यावद् देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, यथा देवदत्तः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ Here the verbs retain their accent by the last <i>sutra</i>.",
    "81038": "The last <i>sutra</i> taught that the verb loses its accent when immediately preceded by यावत् and यथा ॥ This qualifies the word 'immediately' and teaches that the intervention of a Preposition does not debar immediateness. Thus यथा प्रकरोति चारु, यथा प्रपचति शोभनं, यावत् प्रकरोति चारु, यावत् प्रपचति शोभनम् ॥\n\nThe word 'immediately' is understood here also. Thus यावद् देवदत्तः प्रप꣡चति, शोभनं, यथा विष्णुमित्रः प्रकरोति चारु ॥ The <i>upasarga</i> प्र has <i>udatta</i> accent. Prof. Bohtlingk's Edition reads the sutra as व्यपेतं ॥",

Observe, पश्य मृगो धा॒॒व॒॒ति॒॒ ॥\n\nThe repetition of the word पूजायाम् here, though its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been supplied from [[8.1.37]], shows that the negation of that <i>sutra</i> does not extend here: for the पूजायाम् of that <i>sutra</i> is connected with two negatives, the म of that <i>sutra</i>, and the न of (VIII. I. 29), but the पूजायाम् of this <i>sutra</i> is connected with the general न of (VIII. I. 29) only.\n\nAnother example is आदह॑ स्व॒॒धामनु पुन॑र्गर्भ॒॒त्वमे॑रि॒॒रे ॥",
    "81040": "Thus अहो देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, अहो विष्णुमित्रः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ The separation of this अहो from तु &c, of the last <i>sutra</i>, indicates that the next rule applies to अहो only. Had अहो been joined with तु &c, then Rule [[8.1.41]], would have applied to तु &c, which is not desired. Hence the making of it a separate <i>sutra</i>.",
    "81041": "What is the शेष alluded to here? The शेष means here senses other than पूजा or 'praise'. Thus कटमहो करिष्यसि or कटमहो क॒॒रि॒॒ष्य॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ This is a speech uttered in anger or envy and not in praise (असूया वचनं) ॥ So also मम गेहमेष्यसि ॥\n\nThe word शेष is employed in the <i>sutra</i> simply for the sake of distinctness; for <i>sutra</i> 40 applies to cases of <i>puja</i>, while this <i>sutra</i> will give option in cases other than <i>puja</i>.",
    "81042": "The word परीप्सा means त्वरा or 'quick'. Thus अधीष्व माणवक पुरा विद्यो꣡तते विद्युत्, or पुरा स्तनयति स्तनयित्नु ॥ The word पुरा here expresses the future occurrence which is imminent or very near at hand. It is against the rule of <i>Dharmasastras</i> to study while it thunders or lightens.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning haste'? Observe नडेन स्म पुराधी॒॒य॒॒ते॒॒ ॥ Here the word पुरा expresses a past time; that is, it means \"long ago\". So also ऊर्णया स्म पुराधीयते ॥ See [[3.2.118]] and [[3.2.122]], for the employment of पुर in the Past Tense, and [[3.3.4]], for the Present.",
    "81043": "The word एषणा means 'asking, praying'. The word अनुज्ञा means 'permission'. The compound अनुज्ञैषणा means 'asking of permission'. Thus ननु करो꣡मि भोः, \"may I do it, sir\"; ननु ग꣡च्छामि भोः 'can I go sir'. The sense is 'give me permission to do or to go'.\n\nWhy do we say when 'asking for permission'? Observe अकार्षी कटं देवदत्त ? ननु क॒॒रो॒॒मि॒॒ भोः '<i>Devadatta</i> hast thou made the mat? Well, I am making it'. Here ननु has the force of an answering particle, and not used in asking permission and hence the verb loses its accent.",
    "81044": "Thus किं देवदत्तः प꣡चति, आहोस्विद् भुङ्क्ते ॥ किं देवदत्तः शेते꣡, आहोस्विदधीते꣡ ॥ Here some say, that the first verb (पचति or शेते) being directly joined with किं retains its accent, whilst the second verb (भुङ्क्ते or अधीते) not being joined with किं, loses its accent by the general rule [[8.1.28]]. Others say, though the word किं is heard in connection with one verb only, yet as both verbs are objects of doubt, therefore, किं is logically connected with both of them, and so both verbs retain their accents. Thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ will retain its accent according to this view.\n\nWhy do we say when the question relates to a क्रिया or action? The rule will not apply, when the question relates to an object or साधन ॥ Thus किं देवदत्त ओदनं प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ आहोस्विच्छाकं ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when a question is asked\"? Observe किमधीते देवदत्तः ॥ Here किं is used to express contempt, and not to ask a question.\n\nWhy do we say 'not preceded by a Preposition'? Observe किं देवदत्तः प्रपचति आहोस्वित् प्रकरोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"not preceded by a negative particle\". Observe किं देवदत्तो न पठति आहोस्वित् न करोति ॥",
    "81045": "When किम् is elided in asking a question relating to an action, the finite verb which is not preceded by a Preposition or a Negative Particle, optionally does not become <i>anudatta</i>. When is there the elision of this किम् because no rule of <i>Panini</i> has taught it? When the sense is that of an interrogation, but the word किम् is not used. In short, the word '<i>lopa</i>' here does not mean the Grammatical substitute, but merely non-use. As देवदत्तः प꣡चति (or प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒) आहोस्वित् प꣡ठति (or प॒॒ठ॒॒ति॒॒) Here the sentence is interrogative, even without the employment of किम् ॥ The option of this <i>sutra</i> is a <i>Prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, as it is connected with the sense of किम् ॥ The counter-examples are the same as in the last aphorism, but without किम् ॥",
    "81046": "The word प्रहास means great laughter, i.e. derision, mockery, raillery, jeering, gibing, sneering.

Observe एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये इति; सुष्ठु च मन्यसे, साधु च मन्यसे ॥\n\nBy <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.51]], infra, after the Imperative एहि which is a verb of 'motion' (गत्यर्थ), the following First Future (लृट्) would have retained its accent. The present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i> or restriction, namely that in connection with the Imperative एहि मन्ये, the लृट् is accented only then when 'derision' is meant and not otherwise. Thus the लृट् loses its accent here:- एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये ॥ The employment of the First Person in मन्ये in the <i>sutra</i> is not intended to be taught: for by [[1.4.106]], the verb मन् (मन्यते) takes the affix of the First Person instead of the second, when 'derision' is meant and not otherwise. When प्रहास is not intended, the proper personal affix of the Second Person is employed. The employment of the First Person ceases there also by this restrictive rule. Thus एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये ॥\n\nThe above counter example is given according to <i>Kasika</i>, according to which एहि मन्यसे इति उत्तमोपादानमतन्त्रम् ॥ But according to <i>Mahabhashya</i>, the counter-example is एहि मन्ये रथेन या॒॒स्य॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ Here यास्यसि loses its accent. The meaning of the above is त्वं रथेन यास्यसि इति अहं मन्ये, एहि ॥ According to <i>Kaiyyata</i>, this would be an example also under the rule, the First Person not being necessary:- एहि मन्यसे रथेन यास्यामि ॥",
    "81047": "Thus जा꣡तु भोक्ष्य꣡से, जातु अध्यष्य꣡से, जातु करिष्या꣡मि । Here से is <i>anudatta</i> by [[6.1.186]], as it is an <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix coming after an अदुपदेश; the word जातु is first acute, as it is a <i>Nipata</i>. Why do we say 'when not preceded by any other word'? Observe:- कटं जातु क॒॒रि॒॒ष्य॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ The word कटं is end-acute as it is a फिट् or noun.",
    "81048": "The word किम्वृत्तं is a Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> meaning किमोवृत्तं ॥ The word किम्वृत्तं means any form of किम् with its case-affixes, as well as the forms of किम् when it takes the affixes डतर and डतम ॥ Thus कश्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, कश्चिद् भोज꣡यति, कश्चिद् अधीते, केनचित् करो꣡ति, कस्मैचिद् द꣡दाति, कतरश्चित् करो꣡ति, कतमश्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'followed by चित्'? Observe को भुङ्क्ते ॥\n\nThe word अपूर्वं of the last <i>sutra</i> qualifies this also; therefore, the verb loses its accent here:- देवदत्तः किंचित् प॒॒ठ॒॒ति॒॒ ॥",
    "81049": "The prohibition of <i>nighata</i> or want of accentuation is understood here, so also there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of अपूर्वं from the last.\n\nThus आहो or उताहो भुङ्क्ते꣡, उताहो प꣡ठति ॥ Why do we say 'immediately preceding'?

    "81051": "Those verbs which have similar meaning with the word गति 'motion' are called गत्यर्थाः ॥ The Imperative of the गत्यर्थ verbal roots, is called गत्यर्थ-लोट् ॥ In connection with such an Imperative of verbs of 'motion', the First Future does not become <i>anudatta</i>, if the <i>karaka</i> is not all different. The sense is, with whatever case-relation (<i>karaka</i>), whether the Subject or Object, the Imperative is employed, with the same <i>karaka</i>, the First Future must be employed. In connection with the finite verb here, the word कारक denotes the Subject and Object only, and not any other <i>karaka</i>, such as Instrument, &c.\n\nThus आ꣡ग॒॒च्छ॒॒ दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ग्रा꣡मं, द्रक्ष्य꣡स्येनम् 'Come <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i> to the village, thou shalt see it'.

I. 19) and (VII. I. 28), ग्राम is first-acute being formed by the नित् affix मन् ॥ So also आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, ओदनं भोक्ष्यसे \"Come, <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i> ! to the village, you will eat rice\". Here the subjects of both verbs are the same, only the objects are different, and so the rule still applies. आहर देवदत्त शालीम्, यज्ञदत्त एतान् भोक्ष्यते꣡ ॥ Here the subjects are different, but the objects are the same; namely शालीम् ॥ Similarly उह्यन्तां देवदत्तेन शालयः, यज्ञदत्तेन भोक्ष्य꣡न्ते \"Let the rice be carried by <i>Devadatta</i>, and let them be eaten by <i>Yajnadatta</i>.\"\n\nWhy do we say 'verbs of motion'?

In the second example, though भो itself is a Vocative, it is not considered to be non-existent by [[8.1.72]], but becomes effective by virtue of [[8.1.73]], as it is in apposition with the Vocative that follows.\n\nWhy do we say आम्?

See आम् पचसि देवदत्त ॥ Here some hold that अनन्तिक is equivalent to दूर 'far off'. Therefore, according to them, the prohibition applies to एकश्रुतिः as well as निघातः ॥ Had it been merely a prohibition of <i>nighata</i>, then the <i>sutra</i> would become redundant, as the <i>nighata</i> is precluded by the rule of <i>eka</i>-<i>sruti</i> [[1.2.33]]. Thus arguing, they hold that <i>eka</i>-<i>sruti</i> being <i>asiddha</i>, the <i>pluta</i>-<i>udatta</i> of [[8.2.84]], is not prohibited: and so the last vowel is prolated.\n\nOthers say that the word अनन्तिक means 'that which is not far off (दूर) nor very near'. It does not mean दूर only. For had it meant दूर, the author could have used the word दूर in the <i>sutra</i> Therefore the rule of <i>eka</i>-<i>sruti</i> [[1.2.33]], has no scope here at all, for it applies to दूर vocatives. Not being दूर, the <i>plutodatta</i> also should not be exhibited in the illustration; for the rule [[8.2.84]], applies also to दूर Vocatives.\n\nIn the example आम् भो देवदत्त, the word आम् being a <i>Nipata</i> is first acute; the word भो is a shortened form of भवत्, ([[8.3.1]]. <i>Vartika</i>), and it is accentless by [[8.1.19]], being a Vocative case preceded by another word. देवदत्त would also have become accentless by the same rule, this <i>sutra</i> prohibits it. The निपात being thus prohibited by this <i>sutra</i>, two rules make themselves manifest now for application. The one is of एकश्रुतिदूरात्संबुद्धौ [[1.2.33]] causing एकश्रुति or monotony; the other causing प्लुतोदात्तत्वं by दूराद्धूते च [[8.2.84]]. The opinions referred to above, relate to this doubt.",
    "81056": "The <i>anuvritti</i> of आमन्त्रितं should not be taken in this <i>sutra</i>, but that of तिङ् ॥ Thus with यत्परं we have:- गवां गोत्रमुदसृजो यदङ्गिरः ॥ The verb उदसृजः is the Imperfect (लङ्) 2nd person singular of सृज् of <i>Tudadi</i> class. With हि we have, इन्दवो वा मुशन्ति हि (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. I. 2. 4). The verb उशन्ति is the Present (लट्) Plural of वश् of <i>Adadi</i> class. The <i>samprasarana</i> takes place because it belongs to गृह्यादि class. With न we have, आख्यास्यामि तु ते ॥ By the previous <i>sutra</i> (VIII.

The verb retains its accent when these three Particles only follow and not any other. If any other Particle follows, the verb need not retain its accent.

The verb एहि is the 2nd Person Singular of the Imperative of the root इण्, preceded by the Particle आङ् ॥ Here in रोहाव एहि (= रोहाव आइहि), the verb रोहाव is followed by the Particle आ, and does not retain its accent. But for this rule, it would have retained its accent. Because एहि is a गत्यर्थ लोट् (VIII. I. 51), रोहाव is another लोट् in connection with it, and therefore, by (VIII. I. 52) it would have retained its accent. But now it loses its accent because it is a तिङ् following after a non तिङ् word स्वः ॥ It The <i>visarga</i> of स्वः is elided before र् by [[8.3.14]], then the preceding अ is lengthened and we have स्वा [[6.3.111]].

    "81067": "This refers to compounds, the first members of which are praise-denoting words. The word काष्ठादिभ्यः, is added to the <i>sutra</i> from a <i>Vartika</i>.\n\nThus काष्ठाध्यापकः, काष्ठाभिरूपकः, दारुणाध्यापकः, दारुणाभिरूपकः ॥\nअमातापुत्र, अमातापुत्राध्यापकः । अमातापुत्राभिरूपक । अयुताध्यापकः । अयुताभिरूपकः । अद्भुत । अद्भुताध्यापकः । अनुक्त । अनुक्ताध्यापकः । भृश । भृशाध्यापकः । घोर । घोराध्यापकः । सुखः । सुखाध्यापकः । परम । परमाध्यापकः । सु । स्वध्यापकः । अति । अत्यध्यापकः । द्यौः । द्यौरध्यापकः । द्यौरभिरूपकः । स्वध्यापकः । अपुत्र । अपुत्राध्यापकः । कल्याण । कल्याणाध्यापकः ॥\n\nVart:- The final म् should be elided in forming these words. The word दारुणं is an adverb, and therefore in the accusative case, like ग्रामं गतः ॥ In such a case, there can be no compounding: hence the elision of म् is taught. This is the opinion of <i>Vartika</i>-<i>kara</i> <i>Katyayana</i>. According to <i>Kasika</i>, there is compounding under मयूरव्यंसकादि rule, and so म् is elided by the general rule of <i>samasa</i>. This becoming of अनुदात्त takes place in the compound, and after composition. In fact, it is an exception to the general rule by which a compound is finally acute [[6.1.223]] But there is no elision in दारुणमध्यापकः &c. and there is no loss of accent also of the second word. By the <i>Vartika</i> 'मलोपश्च', this further fact is also denoted, where the case-affix is not employed and so the म् is not heard, there the second member becomes <i>anudatta</i>. When there is no compounding, there is no elision of म् as दारुणमधीते, दारुणमध्यापकः ॥\n\nThough the word पूजन would have implied its correlative term पूजित, the specific mention of पूजित in the aphorism indicates, that the word denoting पूजित should follow immediately after the word denoting पूजन ॥ In fact, this peculiar construction of the <i>sutra</i>, is a <i>jnapaka</i> of the existence of the following rule :-\n\nइह प्रकरणे पञ्चमी निर्देशेऽपि नामन्तर्यमाश्रीयते \"In this subdivision or context, though a word may be exhibited in the Ablative case, it does not follow that there should be consecutiveness between the Ablative and the word indicated by it\". This has been illustrated in the previous rule of यद्वृत्तान् नित्यम्, in explaning forms like यद्रयङ् वायुर्वाति &c.\n\nThough the <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>anudatta</i>' was current, the express employment of this term in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the prohibition (of <i>anudatta</i>) which also was current, now ceases.\n\nOn this subject, the following extract from the Commentary on <i>Siddhanta</i>-<i>Kaumudi</i>, will give the view of later Grammarians :- The words काष्ठ &c, are all synonyms of अद्भुत, meaning wonderful, prodigious: and are words denoting praise. This is an aphorism appertaining to <i>samasa</i> subject. In the examples the compounding takes place under the rule of <i>Mayura</i> <i>vyansakadi</i>.\n\nVart:- The elision of म् should be mentioned. दारुणम् + अध्यापकः, in making the compound of these two words, the elision of the case affix, in, this case म, is natural. The <i>vartika</i>, therefore, teaches nothing new, but only repeats this general rule in a particular form. This is the opinion of the authors of <i>Kasika</i>. But according to <i>Kayyata</i>, the commentator on the Great <i>Bhashya</i>, this aphorism is not a <i>samasa</i> rule: and the words दारुणम् &c, are adverbs not admitting of <i>samasa</i>; and so the rule applies to these words when they are not compounded. There is no authority for holding these to be compounds under the <i>Mayuravyansakadi</i> class. <i>Haradatta</i> also says, had this been intended to be a <i>samasa</i> rule, the word समासे would have been used in the <i>sutra</i> and this is valid. There is no <i>adhikara</i> of <i>samasa</i> here, that could have caused <i>samasa</i> and in this view, the <i>vartika</i> मलोपश्च also becomes effective: had it been a <i>samasa</i> rule, the <i>vartika</i> would have been redundant.\n\n1 काष्ठ, 2 दारुण, 3 अमातापुत्र, 4 देश, 5 अनाज्ञात, 6 अनुज्ञात, 7 अपुत्र, 8 अयुत, 9 अद्भुत, 10 अनुक्त, 11 भृश, 12 घोर, 13 सुख्य, 14 परम, 15 सु, 16 अति, 17 कल्याण",
    "81068": "Whether a finite verb is compounded with a <i>gati</i> or stands single, both the compound and the simple verb lose their accent, when it is qualified by the adverbs काष्ठं &c. Thus यत् काष्ठं प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒, यत् काष्ठं प्र॒॒प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ By (VIII. I. 28), the finite verb would have lost its accent after the word काष्ठं, but this loss was prohibited by (VIII. I. 30) in connection with यत्; the present <i>sutra</i> re-ordains the loss, by setting aside the prohibition of [[8.1.30]].\n\nThe word सगति 'along with its <i>Gati</i>', indicates that the <i>Gati</i> even loses its accent. The word <i>Gati</i> here is restricted to <i>Upasargas</i>. Therefore not here यत् काष्ठं शुक्ली करोति, यत् काष्ठं कृष्णी करोति ॥\n\nThe word तिङ् is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that the words qualified by काष्ठं &c in the preceding <i>sutra</i>, were non तिङ् words- i. e. were substantives.

Thus प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ पूति, प्र॒॒प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ पूति, प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ मिथ्या, प्र॒॒प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ मिथ्या ॥\n\nWhy do we say कुत्सने 'denoting the fault of the action'? See प꣡चति शोभनम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say सुपि 'a noun'? Observe प꣡चति क्लिश्नाति ॥\n\nWhy do we say with the exception of गोत्र &c. See प꣡चति गोत्रम्, प꣡चति ब्रुवम्, पचति प्रवचनम् ॥\n\nVart:- It should be mentioned that the 'fault' mentioned in the <i>sutra</i>, must be the fault relating to the mode of doing the action, denoted by the verb. The rule will not apply, if the कुत्सन refers to the agent and not to the action. Thus प꣡चति पूतिर्देवदत्तः, प्रपचति पूतिः ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that पूति has an indicatory  च ॥ The effect of this is that the word पूति is finally acute, because of the indicatory च ॥ The word पूति is not a क्तिन् formed word, because it is not feminine, as we find it in sentences like पूतिरयम्; nor is it a word formed by क्तिच् affix, because this is not a संज्ञा word; therefore, it is a word without a derivation. Therefore by प्रातिपदिक स्वर (<i>Phit</i> I. 1) it will be end-acute. The <i>vartika</i>, therefore, indicates that when पूति causes the loss of accent of the verb, then it is end-acute, but in other cases it is acute on the beginning. According to <i>Padamanjari</i>, पूति is derived from पू by adding the <i>Unadi</i> affix तिप् diversely (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 180), and is first acute.\n\nVart:- A finite verb in the plural number, loses its accent optionally: when it loses its accent, then पूति is end-acute. Thus प॒॒च॒॒न्ति॒॒ पूतिः꣡, or पचन्ति पू꣡तिः, प्रप॒॒च॒॒न्ति॒॒ पूतिः꣡ or प्रपचन्ति पू꣡तिः ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- The following noun denoting fault must refer to the action. The elision of म is intended only in the case of non-verbs, because it is so said by those of old. The word पूति has an indicatory च, but it is optionally so when the verb is plural. The elision of म् mentioned above refers to the elision of म् in दारुणम्-अध्यापकः = दारुणाध्यापकः ॥ The words उक्तार्थम् mean आचार्यपरंपराकथितप्रयोजनमेतदित्यर्थः ॥",
    "81070": "Thus अभ्यु꣡द्धरति, स॒॒मुदा꣡मयति, अभि॒॒सं॒॒प॒॒र्या꣡ हरति ॥ Why do we say गतिः \"a <i>Gati</i> becomes &c\"? Observe दे꣡वदत्तः प्रपचति ॥ Here देवदत्त is a <i>Pratipadika</i> and does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'when followed by a <i>Gati</i>'? Observe आ꣡ मन्द्रैरिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि मयूर रोमभिः ॥ Here आ is a <i>Gati</i> to the verb याहि, the complete verb is आयाहि ॥ But as आ is not followed by a <i>Gati</i>, but by a <i>Pratipadika</i> मन्द्र, it retains its accent. Had the word गतौ not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, this आ would have lost its accent, because the rule would have been too wide, without any restriction of what followed it.",
    "81071": "The word गतिः is understood here. Thus यत् प्र प꣡चति, यत् प्र॒॒करो꣡ति ॥\n\nWhy have we used the word तिङि in the <i>sutra</i> ? In order to restrict the scope of the word उदात्तवति; so that a <i>Gati</i> would not become accentless before every <i>udatta</i> word, but only before <i>udatta</i> verbs. Thus आ does not become <i>anudatta</i> before मन्द्रैः in आ꣡ मन्द्रै꣡ रिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि ॥ If it be said that the word गति is a particular name which the Particles get before verb only, and therefore गति would always refer to its correlative term verb, and not to noun, like as the word father refers to its correlative term son and not nephew: and that, therefore, उदात्तवति must refer to the verb like याहि and not to a noun like मन्द्रैः; then also we say that the employment of the term तिङि is necessary, in order to indicate that the verb must be a finite verb, and not a verbal root. So that though a verbal root be <i>udatta</i>, yet if in its conjugated form (तिङन्त) it is not <i>udatta</i>, the गति will not lose its accent. Thus in यत् प्रकरोति, the root कृ is <i>anudatta</i>, but the तिङन्त form करोति is <i>udatta</i>, hence the rule will apply here: which would not have been the case had उदात्तवति not been qualified by तिङि ॥ For the maxim is यत्क्रियायुक्ताः प्रादयस् तेषां तं प्रति गत्युपसर्गसंज्ञे भवतः ॥  Therefore in a तिङन्त, the designation of गति is with regard to धातु or verbal root. Objection: If तिङि is used for this purpose, then the rule will not apply to an आम् ending forms, like प्र पचतितराम् and प्रपचतितमान्, for these are not तिङन्त; but as a matter of fact, we find that प्र loses its accent, in these forms also. How is this explained? Answer:- Here there are two views : some compound the <i>Gati</i> प्र with the completed आमन्त form पचतितराम् ॥ According to them, this प्र would get the accent, on the rule that an Indeclinable first member retains its accent [[6.2.2]]; so that even if the word तिङ् was not used in the <i>sutra</i>, the form पचतितराम् being the second member of a compound, became <i>anudatta</i>; and so प्र being followed by an <i>anudatta</i> never loses its accent. According to them, therefore, the <i>Gati</i> never loses its accent in प्र꣡पचतितराम् &c. Others compound the word ending in तरप् (पचतितर) with the <i>Gati</i>, and having formed प्रपचतितर, then add the affix आम् ॥ According to this view, the आम् accent debars all other accents, on the maxim, 'the accent of the last prevails' (सतिशिष्ठः), and so प्र is <i>anudatta</i>, not by this rule, but by अनुदात्तसर्वे पदमेकवर्जं ॥ According to them the word is प्रपचतितराम्꣡ ॥ According to both of these views, this <i>sutra</i> is not necessary for the purposes of प्रपचतिराम् &c. But there is a third view which makes this <i>sutra</i> necessary even for this purpose. There is this maxim: गतिकारकोपपदानाम् कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः \"It should be stated that <i>Gatis</i>, <i>Karakas</i> and <i>Upapadas</i> are compounded with bases that end with <i>Krit</i>-affixes, before a case-termination has been added to the latter\". This maxim itself has been explained in two different ways, one saying that the compounding takes place with <i>krit</i>-formed words only before the addition of case-affixes; but with words formed by <i>Taddhita</i> affixes, the compounding does not take place before a case affix has been added. The other view makes no such difference between <i>krit</i>-formed and non-<i>krit</i> formed words. This latter view is not necessary for our purposes. According to the first view, the <i>Gati</i> प्र can never be compounded with पचतितराम् as it is not a सुबन्त ॥ So both प्र and पचतितराम् having different accents, the present <i>sutra</i> became necessary to cause the loss of accent of प्र ॥\n\nWhy have we used the word उदात्तवति? See प्र꣡ पचति, प्र꣡ करोति ॥ Here the verb loses, its accent by [[8.1.28]], hence the <i>Gati</i> retains its accent.",
    "81072": "Such a Vocative is treated as if not at all existing, it is simply ignored. The operation which its presence otherwise would have caused does not take place, and that operation takes place which would have taken place had it not existed. What are the particular purposes served by considering it as non-existent? They are (1) the absence of the accent-less-ness of the subsequent vocative, which the first, taken as a पद, would have caused under [[8.1.19]]. As देव꣡दत्त ! य꣡ज्ञदत्त ! Here the first Vocative देवदत्त does not cause the second Vocative to lose its accent, but it remains first acute by [[6.1.198]]. (2) The accentless-ness of the verb required by (VIII. I. 28) is prevented: as, दे꣡वदत्त प꣡चसि ॥ (3) The substitution of the shorter forms of युष्मद् and अस्मद्, required by [[8.1.20]] — [[8.1.23]] is prevented, as देवदत्त तव (not ते) ग्रामः स्वम्, देवदत्त मम (not मे) ग्रामः स्वम् ॥ (4) The application of [[8.1.37]] takes place, in spite of the intervention of the Vocative between the Particle and the verb; such intervention is not considered as taking away anything from the immediateness (अनन्तरम्) of the Particle from the verb: as, यावद् देवदत्त प॒॒च॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ (5) For the purposes of (VIII. I. 47), though a Vocative may precede जातु, the latter is still considered as अविद्यमानपूर्वं and [[8.1.47]] applies, as देवदत्त जातु प꣡चसि ॥ (6) So also in the case of [[8.1.49]], as आहो देवदत्त प꣡चसि, उताहो देवदत्त पचसि, no option is allowed here by [[8.1.50]].\n\nWhy do we use the word 'as if' or यत् in the <i>sutra</i>, instead of saying 'altogether'? In other words, why do we say \"it is considered as if non-existent\", instead of saying \"it is considered altogether non-existent\"? The vocative does produce its own particular effect. Thus in आम् भो देवदत्त ! the vocative भो is considered as one word (एकान्तर) for the purposes of separating आम् from the vocative देवदत्त under [[8.1.55]]. This is the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>; but the opinion of the author of <i>Kasika</i> is that भो would have been considered as अविद्यमानवत् but for [[8.1.73]].\n\nWhy do we say 'a Vocative'? Observe देवदत्तः प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ Why do we say पूर्वं 'with regard to the subsequent word'? The vocative itself will not be considered as non-existent, for the application of rules that would apply to vocative as such. Thus in देव꣡दत्त य꣡ज्ञदत्त, the vocative देवदत्त gets its accent by [[6.1.193]] also. In fact, the word पूर्वं connotes its correlative पर 'subsequent'; and the vocative is considered as non-existent, for the purposes of the operations to be performed on such subsequent term, whether such operation be caused by the vocative itself, or by any other cause; but it is not to be considered non-existent for the purposes of operations to be performed upon itself. Therefore in दे꣡वदत्त प꣡चसि, <i>Devadatta</i> does get the accent of the vocative. In इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति शतुद्रि the first vocative गङ्गे is considered as non-existent with regard to यमुने, and, therefore, यमुने is considered as following immediately after the <i>pada</i>  मे and thus यमुने becomes <i>anudatta</i>, not because of गङ्गे, but because of मे; similarly सरस्वति and शतुद्रि are <i>anudatta</i>, not because of the preceding Vocative, but because of मे ॥ In other words, the intervention of the vocatives does not stop the action of मे ॥",
    "81073": "This <i>sutra</i> prevents the operation of the last <i>sutra</i> in the particular case when the two Vocatives are in apposition, and the second qualifies the first. Thus अ꣡ग्ने गृ॒॒ह॒॒प॒॒ते॒॒, मा꣡णवकज॒॒टि॒॒ल॒॒का॒॒ध्या॒॒प॒॒क॒॒ ॥ The first vocative being considered as existing, second vocative loses its accent.\n\nWhy do we say 'the vocative subsequent'? Observe देवदत्त प꣡चसि here the verb does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'standing in apposition or समानाधिकरणे? Observe दे꣡वदत्त प꣡ण्डित यज्ञदत्त, here the word पण्डित qualifies यज्ञदत्त, and is not in apposition with देवदत्त, and hence it retains its accent.\n\nWhy do we say सामान्यवचनम् 'which is a generic word'? The rule will not apply when the Vocatives are synonyms. Thus अ꣡घ्न्ये दे꣡वि स꣡रस्वति ई꣡डे का꣡व्ये वि꣡हव्ये एतानि ते अघ्न्ये नामानि ॥ All these Vocatives are synonyms of <i>Saraswati</i>, and hence all retain their accent of the Vocative [[6.1.198]]. According to <i>Padamanjari</i> the reading given in <i>Taittariya</i> <i>Brahmanam</i> is:- इडे रत्नेऽदिते सरस्वति प्रिये प्रेयसि महि विश्रुते, एतानि ते अघ्निये नामानि ॥ सामान्यवचनम् means 'a generic term'. When the first is a generic term, and the second is a specific term, (विशेष वचन) qualifying the first, and both are in the singular number, there the present rule will apply.",
    "81074": "This ordains option, where the last <i>sutra</i> would have made the consideration of the first vocative as existent compulsory. Thus दे꣡वाः श꣡रण्याः or दे꣡वा श॒॒र॒॒ण्याः॒॒ ॥ ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै꣡याकरणाः or ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै॒॒या॒॒क॒॒र॒॒णाः॒॒ ॥\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of सामान्यवचनम् is understood here; the second vocative, therefore, must be a विशेषवचन, as being the correlative of the former: where is then the necessity of employing the word विशेषवचने in the <i>sutra</i>? This word is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision only.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the plural number'? Observe मा꣡णवक ज॒॒टि॒॒ल॒॒क॒॒ ॥ No option is allowed here, and the preceding vocative is always considered as existent and so rule [[8.1.73]] applies.\n\nThe <i>sutras</i> [[8.1.73]] and [[8.1.74]] as enunciated by <i>Panini</i> are:- 73. नामन्त्रिते समानाधिकरणे; 74. सामान्यवचनं विभाषितं विशेषवचने (i. e. [[8.1.73]]. The preceding Vocative is not considered as non-existent, if the subsequent word is a Vocative in apposition with it. 74. Optionally so, if the preceding vocative is a general term and the subsequent vocative is a particular term). <i>Patanjali</i> made the amendment by adding सामान्यवचने to 73 also, and the author of <i>Kasika</i> has added बहुवचनम् to 74 from the commentary of <i>Patanjali</i> and has omitted सामान्यवचनं from it: though he reads its <i>anuvritti</i>.",
    "82001": "This is an <i>Adhikara</i> or governing rule, and extends upto the end of the Book. Whatever we shall teach hereafter is to be understood as non-existent, with regard to the preceding rule. With regard to whatever has been taught in the preceding Seven Books and a quarter, the rules contained in these three last chapters are considered as <i>asiddha</i>. And further, in these three chapters, a subsequent rule is, as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned. The word in असिद्धम् = असिद्धवद्भवति, सिद्धकार्यं न करोति ॥ The rule is \"as if non-effective, does not produce the operation of a <i>siddha</i> or effective rule\". This rule of non-effectiveness is for the sake of prohibiting the operation of an <i>adesa</i> rule, and establishing the operation of an <i>utsarga</i> or general rule. Thus अस्मा उद्धर; द्वा अत्र; द्वा आनय, असा आदित्यः ॥ In all these, the elision of व् and य् by [[8.3.19]], being considered as not to have taken effect, there is no further <i>sandhi</i>, and आ + उ does not give rise to <i>guna</i>, nor आ + अ = आ ॥ In fact, for the purposes of the application of आद्गुणः rule of [[6.1.87]], or the दीर्घ rule of [[6.1.101]], the rule [[8.3.19]] is considered as not to have taken effect at all.\n\nSimilarly अमुष्मै, अमुष्मात्, अमुष्मिन् from अदस् ॥ Thus अदस् + ङे = अद + ङे [[7.2.102]] अ being substituted for the final स्, which again merges in the preceding अ [[6.1.97]] = अमु + ङे [[8.2.80]]. उ being substituted for अ, and म् for द् of अद). Now the substitution of स्मै for ङे takes place only after Pronouns ending in अ; but अमु is a pronoun ending in उ, so this स्मै [[7.1.14]] should not take place. The present <i>sutra</i> helps us out of this difficulty, and the change of अ into उ by [[8.2.80]] is considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the application of [[7.1.14]].\n\nशुष्किका शुष्कजङ्घा च क्षामिमानौजढत्तथा ।\nमतोर्वत्वे भलां जश्त्वं, गुडलिण्मान्निदर्शनम् ॥\n\nThe forms शुष्किका, शुष्कजङ्घा, क्षामिमान्, औजढत्, and गुडलिण्मान् illustrate this rule excellently.\n\n(1) शुष्किका ॥ To the root शुष् we add the <i>Nishtha</i> त, as शुष् + त = शुष् + क (त changed to क by [[8.2.51]]) = शुष्क ॥ Add the feminine affix टाप् and we have शुष्का ॥ Add to this the affix क [[5.3.70]], [[5.3.73]], as शुष्का + क  = शुष्काक, the feminine of which with टाप् will be शुष्कका (the shortening taking place by [[7.4.13]]). Now अ is changed to इ by [[7.3.44]] and we have शुष्किका ॥ Now rule [[7.3.46]] makes this इ substitution optional, when a क् precedes the अ, as is the case here: and that rule would require the alternative form शुष्कका ॥ But there is no such alternative form, because the क of शुष्क was the substitute of त by [[8.2.51]], which is considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the application of [[7.3.46]].\n\n(2) शुष्कजङ्घा ॥ Here rule [[6.3.37]] would have required the form to be शुष्काजङ्घा like मद्रिकाकल्पा; there being no <i>pun</i>-<i>vad</i>-<i>bhava</i> when there is a penultimate क ॥ But the क in शुष्का being the result of [[8.2.51]] is considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of [[6.3.37]].\n\n(3) क्षामिमान् ॥ This word may be considered to have been formed by adding the affix मतुप् to the Patronymic word क्षामिः or to the noun क्षामिन् [क्षामस्यापत्यं = क्षामिः, or क्षामोऽस्यास्तीति = क्षामिन्] ॥ The word क्षाम is formed by adding the <i>Nishtha</i> त to the root क्षै, as क्षै + त + क्षा + त [[6.1.45]] = क्षाम (the त being changed to म by [[8.2.53]]). Now this म is considered as non-effectual for the purposes of application of [[8.2.9]], which requires the change of म of मत् to व, when मत् is added to a word having a penultimate म, as in शमीवान् ॥ Therefore we have क्षामिमान् and not क्षामिवान् ॥\n\n(4) औजढत् ॥ This is the Aorist third person singular of the Derivative root औढि, from the Past-Participle of वह् ॥ Thus वह् + त = ऊढ [[6.1.15]]. Add to it णिच् in the sense of तमाख्यत् [[3.1.26]]: and then form its लुङ् ॥ The लुङ् is formed by adding चङ् [[3.1.48]], before which the stem is reduplicated [[6.1.11]]. In reduplicating, all the rules that went before in forming ऊढ are considered <i>asiddha</i>; viz. the rule by which ह was changed to ढ (as वह् + त = उह् + त = उढ् + त [[8.1.31]], the rule by which त was changed to ध (उढ् + त = उढ् + ध [[8.1.40]], the rule by which ध was changed to ढ [[8.4.41]], and the rule by which the first ढ was elided [[8.3.13]] as उढ् + ढ = उ + ढ = ऊढ [[6.3.111]]. The elision of टि before णि being considered <i>sthanivat</i>, we reduplicate ह्त; as ऊह्तढ + चङ् + त् = ऊहढत् [[7.4.60]] = ऊझढत् [[7.4.62]] = ऊजढत् [[8.4.54]]. There is no इ added by [[7.4.79]], because of the prohibition of अनग्लोपे of [[7.4.93]]. With the augment, it becomes औजढत् ॥ The form औजिढत् is from उढि ending in the affix क्तिन् ॥\n\n(5) गुडलिण्मान् ॥ This is formed by adding मतुप् to the word गुडलिह्, which is formed by क्विप् (गुडं लेढि) Here also the म of मतुप् is not changed into व by [[8.2.10]]; because the change of ह् to ढ् [[8.1.3]], and again of ढ् to ड् are considered <i>asiddha</i>.\n\nThe rules of interpretation, however, contained in the previous part will apply to this part also; because such rules cannot be considered 'prior' or पूर्व; for they become operative then only when occasion requires to apply them. The maxim which governs such rules is कार्यकालं हि संज्ञा परिभाषम् ॥ The rules, therefore, which are exhibited here in the sixth case such as [[8.2.23]], or the seventh case, as [[8.2.26]], or the fifth case, as [[8.2.27]], should be interpreted in accordance with the <i>sutras</i> षष्ठी स्थाने योगा, तस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टे पूर्वस्य, तस्मादिति उत्तरस्य ॥\n\nBut with regard to the <i>paribhasha</i> विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यं, the above will not hold good. For, by the very fact, that a subsequent rule in these chapters, is held to be <i>asiddha</i>, with regard to the prior, there cannot arise any conflict of two rules of equal force with regard to them. And it is only where there is such a conflict, that the above rule of interpretation applies. This being so, in विस्फोर्यम्, अवगोर्यम् formed by ण्यत् [[3.1.124]] the <i>guna</i> ordained by [[7.3.86]] is not debarred by the दीर्घ rule [[8.2.77]], because there is no conflict between <i>guna</i> rule [[7.3.86]] and the <i>dirgha</i>-rule [[8.2.77]], for the latter is simply non-existent with regard to the former.\n\nBut though the विप्रतिषेध rule does not apply in these chapters; yet an <i>apavada</i> rule here even, does over-ride an <i>utsarga</i> rule, for otherwise, the enunciation of an <i>apavada</i> rule would be useless. The <i>apavada</i> rule is therefore, not considered <i>asiddha</i>. Thus the <i>utsarga</i> rule होढः [[8.2.31]] is set aside by the <i>apavada</i> rule दादेर्धातोर्घः [[8.2.32]], and thus we have दोग्धा, दोग्धुम् (दुह् + तृच् = दोघ् + तृच्) ॥",
    "82002": "The word विधि in the <i>sutra</i> applies to all the four words preceding it: as सुब्विधि, स्वरविधि &c. The force of the Genitive compound in स्वरविधि, संज्ञाविधि, तुग्विधि is that of ordaining the existence of something: e.g. when an accent is to be given to a word, or a particular designation is to be given to it or when त् is to be added to it, (भावसाधन) ॥ The compound सुब्विधि means however, the rule relating to the case-endings themselves, as well as, the rule which would apply to a word, when a case-ending follows (कर्मसाधन) ॥\n\n(1) सुब्विधि :- As राजभिः, तक्षभिः ॥ Here the elision of न् of राजन् and तक्षन् being <i>asiddha</i>, the भिस् is not changed to ऐस् by [[7.1.9]]. So also राजभ्याम्, तक्षभ्यां, राजसु, तक्षसु ॥ Here the finals of राज and तक्ष are not lengthened before भ्यां by सुपिच [[7.3.102]] and nor changed to ए before सु by [[7.3.103]]: as in नराभ्यां and नरेषु of the stem ending in अ ॥\n\n(2) स्वरविधि :- As रा꣡जवती and not राजवती꣡ ॥ For the elision of न् being <i>asiddha</i>, the rule [[6.1.220]], does not apply, for the word is considered not to end in अवती but न्वती ॥ Similarly in पञ्चार्मम् and दशार्मम्, the elision of न being <i>asiddha</i>, the first member does not become <i>ady</i>-<i>udatta</i> by [[6.2.90]]. Similarly पञ्चवीजी : the elision of न् being <i>asiddha</i>, the first member does not retain its original accent as required by [[6.2.29]].\n\nThe word राजन् is first acute, as it is formed by the affix कनिन् (<i>Unadi</i> I. 156). राजवती is formed by adding ङीप् to the मतुप् ending word, by [[4.1.6]]. पञ्चार्मम् is a compound under rule [[2.1.50]] of पञ्चन् + अर्म, and when न् is elided, the first member becomes a word ending in अ and would require the accent of [[6.2.90]].\n\n(3) संज्ञाविधि :- As पञ्च ब्राह्मण्यः, दश ब्राह्मण्यः ॥ The elision of म् being <i>asiddha</i>, the words पंच and दश are still called <i>shash</i> though they no longer end in न् (ष्णान्ता षट् [[1.1.24]]). Being called षष्, they do not take टाप् in the feminine [[4.1.10]].\n\nAccording to the <i>Vartikakara</i>, there is no necessity of using the word संज्ञा in the <i>sutra</i> (संज्ञा ग्रहणानर्थक्यं च नन्निमित्तंत्वाल्लोपस्य), because the elision of न् is caused by reason of its having such a designation (as षट्). Thus without its having the name of षट् there would be no elision of जस् and शस्, without such elision, there is no <i>pada</i> <i>sanjna</i> of these words, and unless these words get <i>Pada</i> designation, there can be no elision of न् by [[8.2.7]]. The <i>shash</i> designation, however, would not be retained by these words after taking plural affixes, when feminine affixes are to be added to them, but for this <i>sutra</i>. The पञ्चन् and दशन् ending in न् would require ङीप् in the feminine, which is however prohibited, for when जस् and न् are elided, the words end in अ and require टाप् for their feminine, which is also prohibited, because, by the present <i>sutra</i> the word still retains its designation of षट् ॥\n\nQuestion: How can this be the purpose of this <i>sutra</i>? There are two views as regard definitions (संज्ञा), the one is that a particular name is given to a thing once for all, prior to any operations; and operations are performed afterwards upon it or with it, as occasions arise. This view is embodied in the maxim यथोद्देशं संज्ञापरिभाषम् '<i>Sanjna</i>, and <i>Paribhashas</i> remain where they are taught.' The other view is that the <i>sanjna</i> <i>sutra</i> is to be read with every particular operative <i>sutra</i>, and the <i>sanjna</i> given to the word afresh, with every new operation. In other words, the <i>sanjna</i> <i>sutra</i> becomes identified with a <i>vidhi</i> <i>sutra</i>, every time that a <i>vidhi</i> is to be applied. This is embodied in the maxim कार्यकालं संज्ञापरिभाषम् \"<i>Sanjnas</i> and <i>Paribhasas</i> are attracted by or unite with the rules that enjoin certain operations.\" In the first view, the षट् <i>sanjna</i> will be good throughout, both for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस् and for prohibiting टाप् ॥ Hence thus <i>sutra</i> is not necessary in that view. But in the other view, the <i>sutra</i> is necessary. For if the view be taken that a <i>sanjna</i> is to be applied with regard to each operation, then that षट् <i>sanjna</i> which had taken effect for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस्, will no longer hold good for the purposes of preventing the application of the feminine affix. Hence, the word संज्ञा is taken in this <i>sutra</i>, to prevent the application of the second view.\n\n(4) तुग्विधिः - Thus वृत्रहभ्यां, वृत्रहभिः ॥ On account of the elision of म् being <i>asiddha</i>, the तुक् augment is not added, though required by [[6.1.71]]. (ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्) ॥\n\nSome hold that तुक् need not be read in the <i>sutra</i>. They argue in this way:- There is this maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य \"That which is taught in a rule, the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination\". Now the elision of न् of वृत्रहन् took place because of the case affix भ्यां, this elision cannot be the cause of adding तुक् ॥ Or the तुक् being a बहिरङ्ग operation would be <i>asiddha</i> with regard to the <i>antaranga</i> elision of न् ॥ This opinion is, however, not sound. The employment of तुक् in this <i>sutra</i> indicates, that the two maxims above referred to, are not of universal application i.e. they are <i>anitya</i>.\n\nWhy do we say before a <i>Krit</i>-affix? Observe वृत्रहच्छत्रम्, वृत्रहच्छाया ॥ Here तुक् is added by [[6.1.73]].\n\nThe elision of न् taught by [[8.2.7]] &c would be <i>asiddha</i> by the general rule [[8.2.1]]; the specification of the four cases in which it is <i>asiddha</i> shows that it is a restrictive or <i>niyama</i> rule. That is, the elision of न् is considered <i>asiddha</i> only with regard to these four rules, and no other. It is not <i>asiddha</i> in राजीयते (राजन् + क्यच् + ते = राज + य + ते = राजीयते) [[3.1.8]], [[7.4.33]]. There would not have been long ई had the नलोप been <i>asiddha</i>. So also राजायते there is lengthening, [[7.4.25]] and राजाश्च there is <i>ekadesa</i> [[6.1.101]].",
    "82003": "The existence of सु is not considered uneffected when there is to be added ना ॥ On the contrary, it is considered as <i>siddha</i> or existing. Thus सु being considered as <i>siddha</i>, अमु gets the designation of घि by [[1.4.7]], and as such, its Instrumental Singular is by [[7.3.120]], अमुना ॥ Had the सु been considered as non-effected, then the stem would not have been called <i>ghi</i>, and there would have been no  ना added. But when ना had been added, then the सु being <i>asiddha</i>, अमु is considered to be as अद ending in अ, and this अ would require lengthening by सुपि च [[7.3.102]]: but it is not done on the maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य \"that which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination\". There being no long आ the उ of अमु remains short. Or this <i>sutra</i> may be considered to be the condensation of two <i>sutras</i> (1) सु, is <i>siddha</i> when ना is to be added, (2) सु is <i>siddha</i> when any operations, otherwise to be caused when ना is added, are to take place. Or the sense of the <i>sutra</i> is ने परतो यत् प्राप्नोति तस्मिन् कर्त्तव्ये मुभावो नासिद्धः \"the सु is not non-effected in relation to any operation that would otherwise be occasioned when ना followed\". From this, it would follow by implication that सु must be considered valid for the purposes of नाभाव itself. So सु being always <i>siddha</i>, ना is added : and there is no lengthening.\n\nVart:- That <i>ekadesa</i> accent which is <i>antaranga</i>, should be considered as <i>siddha</i>. What is the necessity of this <i>vartika</i>? In order to regulate the accents of 1. अय्, 2. आय्, 3. आव् substitutions of ए, ऐ and औ; 4. the accent of <i>ekadesa</i> substitutes, 5. the accent of the शतृ formed words, 6. for the purposes of rule [[6.1.158]], by which all syllables of a word are <i>anudatta</i> except one, and 7. for the purposes of [[8.1.28]], by which all syllables become <i>anudatta</i>.\n\nThus (1) let us take अय् first. वृक्ष꣡ is finally acute by <i>Phit</i> I. 1. The locative of this is वृक्ष + ङि (<i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.3]]) = वृक्षे꣡ (ए is <i>udatta</i> [[8.2.5]]). Now combine वृक्षे꣡ + इदम् = वृक्ष꣡य् + इदम् = वृक्ष꣡ इदम् ॥ So also प्लक्ष इदम् ॥ The <i>udatta</i> <i>ekadesa</i> ए꣡ must be considered as <i>siddha</i>, so that the अय् substitute of ए should also become <i>udatta</i>. (2) आय् : As कुमार्या꣡ इदम् ॥ Here also आ is <i>udatta</i> for similar reasons. कुमारी + ङे = कुमारी + आ॒॒ + ए॒॒ [[7.3.112]] = कुमार्य् + आ॒॒ + ए॒॒ = कुमार्य् + आ꣡ + ए॒॒ [[6.1.174]] = कुमार्य्  + ऐ [[6.2.90]] = कुमार्यै꣡ [[8.2.5]]. The ऐ is <i>udatta</i> and its आय् substitute will also be <i>udatta</i>. How do you give this example? This example is then valid, when by [[6.1.174]], first the affix आ is made <i>udatta</i>, then this आ (आट् [[7.3.112]]) augment is added to ङे, and then (आ + ए) there is <i>vriddhi</i> ऐ; and then कुमार्य्  + ऐ = कुमार्यै ॥ But if the order be reversed and आ + ए be first combined into ऐ, and then this ऐ꣡ be made <i>udatta</i> by [[6.1.174]], then there would be no necessity of this <i>vartika</i> for the purposes of आय् ॥ The word कुमार꣡ is end-acute by <i>Phit</i> accent (<i>Phit</i> I. 1). And to it ङीप् in the feminine [[4.1.20]], as कुमार꣡ + ई = कुमार् + ई॒॒ (अ is elided by [[6.4.148]] = कुमार् + ई꣡ (VI. I. 161) = कुमारी꣡ ॥\n\n(3) आव्. As वृक्षावि꣡दम् or प्लक्षावि꣡दम्, for the same reasons as above [ वृक्ष꣡ + औ (<i>anudatta</i>) = वृक्षौ꣡ [[8.2.5]], वृक्षौ + इदम् ].\n\n(4) एकादेश accent. As गाङ्गेऽनूपे ॥ Here गाङ्ग꣡ + इ = गाङ्गे ॥ The word गाङ्ग is formed by अण् affix (गंगाया इदम्) and is end-acute. The <i>ekadesa</i> ए is <i>udatta</i> by [[8.2.5]]. This <i>udatta</i> accent will remain valid: so that when for ए + अ there is <i>purva</i>-<i>rupa</i>-<i>ekadesa</i> by [[6.1.109]], this <i>ekadesa</i> ए will be <i>udatta</i> by [[8.2.5]], or it will be <i>svarita</i> by [[8.2.6]]. The word अनूप꣡ is a प्रादि compound, आपोऽनुगतं = अनूपं ॥ Here by [[6.2.2]], the Indeclinable first term would have retained its accent: but the word is end-acute by [[6.2.189]].\n\n(5) शतृ - accent. As तुदती, तुदते ॥ Here in तुद् + श + शतृ, the affix श is <i>udatta</i>, and शतृ is <i>anudatta</i>. The <i>ekadesa</i> अ will be <i>udatta</i> by [[8.2.5]]. This <i>ekadesa</i> - <i>udatta</i> should be considered valid for the purposes of the rule [[6.1.173]] by which the feminine affix and the weak case-ending are <i>udatta</i>. Thus तुद꣡त् + ई꣡ = तुदती꣡, तुद꣡त् + ए = तुदते꣡ ॥ The prohibition अनुमः in [[6.1.173]] is a <i>jnapaka</i> or indicator of the fact that the <i>ekadesa</i> accent should be considered <i>siddha</i>, in the accent of the शतृ, because without this <i>ekadesa</i> accent, there is no <i>satri</i> ending word with नुम् which is <i>antodatta</i>.\n\n(6) एकामनुदात्तः accent. As तुदन्ति, लिखन्ति ॥ Here in तुद् + श + अन्ति॒॒ [[6.1.186]] the <i>ekadesa</i> अ is <i>udatta</i> by [[8.2.5]], and this <i>ekadesa</i> accent is considered valid for the purposes of rule [[6.1.158]], by which all the remaining syllables become <i>anudatta</i>, as तु॒॒द꣡न्ति॒॒, लि॒॒ख꣡न्ति॒॒ ॥\n\n(7) सर्वानुदात्तः accent. As ब्राह्मणास्तुद॒॒न्ति॒॒, ब्राह्मणा लि॒॒ख॒॒न्ति॒॒ ॥ Here the <i>ekadesa</i>-accent of तुदन्ति and लिख꣡न्ति being valid, rule [[7.1.28]] applies, and all the syllables become <i>anudatta</i>.\n\nThe word <i>antaranga</i> is used in the <i>vartika</i> to indicate that the <i>Bahiranga</i> <i>ekadesa</i> accent will not be <i>siddha</i>. Thus पचती꣡ति and प्र꣡पचती꣡ति, where the word इ꣡ति is first acute, as it is an Indeclinable. And सोमसुत् पचती꣡ति ॥ The accent of पचति + इति = पचतीति is governed by [[8.2.5]]. This <i>ekadesa</i> accent of long ई has reference to external <i>sandhi</i>, and therefore naturally it is a <i>bahiranga</i>. This <i>bahiranga</i> <i>ekadesa</i> accent is not <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of the application of previous <i>sutras</i>. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.71]]. requires that the <i>gati</i> should be unaccented before an accented verb: but प्र does not lose its accent, as पचतीति is not considered as an accented verb. In the second example, the ई of ती is not considered as accented, therefore, it does not become <i>anudatta</i> by [[8.1.28]].\n\nVart:- The rule [[8.2.23]] causing the elision of the final consonant in a word ending with a conjunct consonant, should be valid for the purposes of changing रु into उ ॥ What is the necessity of this <i>vartika</i> ? Observe हरिवो मेदिनं त्वा ॥ The word हरिवः is formed by मतुप् affix हरयोऽस्य सन्ति = हरि + मत् ॥ Now by [[8.2.15]] the म is changed to व, as हरि + वत् or हरिवत्; add सु (Vocative Singular) as हरिवत् + सु, then add नुम् augment, as हरिवन्त् + सु ॥ Then there is elision of the final consonant = हरिवन् ॥ Now by [[8.3.1]]. the final न् is changed to र्, and we have हरिवर्, the र् would be changed to उ by [[6.1.114]], if the elision of the conjunct consonants be considered as <i>siddha</i>: for then this र् is followed by म, a हश् letter. But if such elision be considered <i>asiddha</i>, then र् is considered not to be followed by हश् letters, but by the consonants which were elided.\n\nVart:- When <i>ekadesa</i> is to be done, the elision of सिच् is to be considered <i>siddha</i> or valid. As अलावीत् and अपावीत् ॥ Here the सिच् is elided by इट ईटि (VIII. 2. 28.) This elision is considered valid or <i>siddha</i>, and thus we have <i>dirgha</i> single substitution of ई for इ + ई as अलाव् + इ + सीत् = अलाव् + इ + ० + ईत् = अलावीत् ॥\n\nVart:- The substitute of the <i>Nishtha</i> affixes should be considered as valid or <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of the rules relating to the (1) changing of स to ष्, (2) accent, (3) affix, and (4) इट् augment. As (1) वृकणः, वृकण्वान् ॥ The root is ओव्रश्चु (VI. 11) the indicatory ओ shows that the <i>nishtha</i> त is changed to न [[8.2.45]]. This <i>nishtha</i> substitute is considered as valid or <i>siddha</i>, and the final of the root is not changed to ष, as it otherwise would have been by [[8.2.36]]: for न would have been still considered as त or a झल् letter. The equation is as follows :- व्रश्च् + त = वृश्च् + त [[6.1.16]] = वृश्च् + न [[8.2.45]] = वृच् + न [[8.2.29]] = वृक् + न  [[8.2.30]] = वृक्णः [[8.4.1]] The च् is changed to क् by [[8.2.30]], by considering न as <i>asiddha</i> and therefore equal to त or a झल् letter. Thus it will be seen that this न is असिद्ध for the purposes of rule [[8.2.30]], but it is सिद्ध only for the purposes of rule [[8.2.36]].\n\nAs regards the other three cases, viz, accent, affix and इट् augment, the one word क्षीब्, will illustrate them all. The irregular formation of this word is variously explained. It is formed by \"<i>nipatana</i>\" under [[8.2.55]]. It is the Past Participle of the root क्षीब्, thus evolved क्षीब् + इट् + त = क्षीब् + इ + त = क्षीब् + अ (इत् being elided, this is the anomaly) = क्षीब ॥ Here the elision of इत् is considered as valid and <i>siddha</i>, and therefore, क्षी꣡ब is considered as a word of two syllables, for the purposes of accent, under rule निष्ठाच द्व्यजनात् [[6.1.205]]. Had the <i>lopadesa</i> of इत् been considered <i>asiddha</i>, the word would have been considered as if of three syllables, and that rule of accent would not have applied.\n\nSimilarly क्षीबेन तरति = क्षी꣡बिक formed by ष्ठन् [[4.4.7]] which affix is added, because it is considered a word of two syllables, the elision of इत् being considered as valid for the purposes of [[4.4.7]].\n\nSimilarly क्षीब may be considered to have been formed by eliding the त्; as क्षीब् + त = क्षीब् + अ ॥ In this view of its formation, the augment इट् is not added, because the <i>lopa</i> of त् is considered as valid and <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of इट् augment. In the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>, the words इट् विधि may well be omitted from the <i>vartika</i>, for इट् being a portion of a प्रत्यय, the word प्रत्ययविधि would include इट्-विधि also.\n\nVart:- The prolation modification of a vowel (<i>pluta</i>) should be considered as valid and <i>siddha</i>, for the purposes of the rule relating to तुक् augment before the letter छ ॥ Thus by [[8.2.107]], the Vocative words अग्ने and पटो assume the forms अग्ना३इ, and पटा३उ ॥ These इ and उ are <i>pluta</i>-<i>vikaras</i>. As अग्ना ३ इच्छत्रम् । पटा ३ उच्छत्रम् ॥ Here the modification caused by [[8.2.107]], is considered as valid and <i>siddha</i>; otherwise there would have been no compulsory तुक् augment as required by [[6.1.73]] but optional तुक् under [[6.1.76]].\n\nVart:- The श् and palatal change should be considered <i>siddha</i> and valid before घुट् [[8.3.291]]. The root श्चुतिर् क्षरणे (1. 41) is read as beginning with a स, which is changed to श because of the subsequent च by [[8.4.40]]. This is not considered <i>asiddha</i>. Had it been so, there would come घुट् augment by [[8.3.29]], in अट् श्च्योतति, रट् श्च्योतति ॥ The words अट् and रट् are अड् and रड् formed from the roots अटति and रटति by क्विप् ॥\n\nWhy is the root श्च्युतिर् considered to begin with स् and not with श् as we find it written? Because had it been a root beginning with श् originally, we could not get the form मघुक् which would have been मघुट् ॥ The form मघुक् is thus evolved. Thus मधु श्च्योतति = मधुश्च्युत् by adding क्विप् ॥ From मधुश्च्युत् we form a Derivative root in णिच् in the sense of मधुश्च्युतमाचष्टे = मधुश्च्ययति ॥ Add again क्विप् to this Derivative root मधुश्चि, the णिच् will be elided, and we have मधुश्च्य्, then श् (which represents स्) is elided because it is at the beginning of a compound letter [[8.2.29]], and य् is elided, because it is at the end of a conjunct letter final in a <i>pada</i> [[8.2.23]], and thus there remains मधुच्, and च् is changed to क् [[8.2.30]] we have मधुक् ॥ Had the root been शकारादि, then this श could not be elided, and so we should elide only the final च् and य् and the form would be मधुश् which would be changed to ष् and then to ट् and we should get मधुट् which is not desired.\n\nVart:- The जश् and चर् substitution of letters in the reduplicate should be considered <i>siddha</i> and valid for the purposes of ए change [[6.4.120]] and तुक् augment. Thus बभणतुः and बभणुः ॥ Here the जश् change of भ, to ब in the reduplicate should be considered as valid, otherwise this would be अनादेशादि root and the Perfect would be भेणतुः and भेणुः ॥ Similarly from छिद् we have चिच्छित्सति, and from उच्छ, उचिच्छिषति ॥ In the latter, the second syllable छिस् of उछिस् (Desiderative) is reduplicated by [[6.1.2]]. Here had the reduplicate substitute च for छ been considered <i>asiddha</i>, there would not have been तुक् augment by छे च (VI. I. 73)\n\nVart:- The change of letter homogeneous with the subsequent is valid and <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of doubling. As सय्यन्ता, सव्व्वत्सरः, यल्ल्लोकम्, तल्ल्लोकम् ॥ In सय्यन्ता &c the म् is changed to <i>anusvara</i> by [[8.3.23]], and the <i>anusvara</i> is then changed to a letter homogeneous with the subsequent by [[8.4.58]]. Had the परसवर्ण change been <i>asiddha</i>, there would have been no doubling by [[8.4.47]].\n\nVart:- If there be the <i>adhikara</i> of the word '<i>pada</i>' in those <i>sutras</i> which ordain the following changes, then those changes are considered <i>siddha</i> for doubling, namely, 1. लत्व the change into ल [[8.2.21]], 2. ढत्व the change into ढ [[8.2.31]], 3. घत्व the change in to घ [[8.2.33]]. 4. नत्व the change into न [[8.2.56]], 5. रुत्व the change to रु [[8.2.75]], 6. षत्व the change to ष [[8.3.85]], 7. णत्व the change to ण [[8.4.11]], 8. <i>anunasika</i> change [[8.4.45]], 9. छत्व the change to छ [[8.4.63]].\n\nAs 1. गलो गलः; गरोगरः ॥ 2. द्रोग्धा द्रोग्धा ॥ 3. द्रोढाद्रोढा ॥ 4. नुन्नो नुन्नः or नुत्तो नुत्तः ॥ 5. अभिनोऽभिनः or अभिनद् अभिनत् This is लङ् second person singular of भिद्, the स् of सिप् is elided by [[6.1.68]], and the final त् changed optionally to रु by [[8.2.74]]. The न is the <i>vikarana</i> श्नम् ॥ 6. मातुः ष्वसा मातुः ष्वसा or मातुः स्वसा, मातुः स्वसा, 7. माषवापाणि माषवापाणि or माषवापानि माषवापानि ॥ 8. वाङ् नयनम् वाङ् नयनम् or वाग्नयनम् वाग्नयनम् ॥ 9. वाक् च्छयनं वाक्च्छयनं or वाक्शयन वाक्शयनं ॥\n\nThe लत्व &c, changes being all optional, had the changes been considered <i>asiddha</i>, we would have got the following double forms also गरोगल, गलोगरः which are not desired.\n\nAll these can be explained by dividing the <i>sutra</i> न मु ने into two. The first being न, and this negative will prohibit all <i>asiddha</i>-ness mentioned in the preceding <i>vartikas</i>. The second <i>sutra</i> would be मु ने, and we would here draw in the <i>anuvritti</i> of न from the preceding.",
    "82004": "An unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, when it comes after a यण् (semi-vowel), which यण् itself has come in the room of a vowel which was acute or <i>svarita</i> once.\n\nLet us first take the vowel following an <i>udatta</i> <i>yan</i>. Thus कुमा॒॒र्यौ॑, कुमा॒॒॑र्यः ॥ The word कुमारी꣡ is acutely accented on the final, because the long ई (ङीप्) replaces अ꣡ of कुमार [[6.1.161]]. The semi-vowel य् is substituted in the room of this acute ई꣡; the <i>anudatta</i> आ and अः become <i>svarita</i> after such a य् ॥\n\nNow to take an example of a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. The words सकृल्लू꣡ and खलपू꣡ are finally acute by <i>krit</i>-accent [[6.2.139]]. The Locative singular of these words are खलपू꣡ + इ॒॒ = खल्पिवं, and सकृल्ल्वि by [[6.4.83]]. This व् is a semi-vowel which comes in the room of the acute ऊ꣡, therefore, it is <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>. After this <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>, the <i>anudatta</i> इ of the Locative becomes <i>svarita</i> by the first part of this <i>sutra</i>. Now when खलप्वि॑ + आशा꣡ and सकृल्ल्वि॑ + आशा꣡ are combined by <i>sandhi</i>, this <i>svarita</i> इ is changed to य्; it is, therefore, a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. The unaccented आ will become <i>svarita</i>, after this <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. As खलप्व्या॑शा and सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा ॥ The word आशा is finally acute and consequently आ is not acute (<i>Phit</i>. I. 18).\n\nObjection:- Here an objector may say: that the <i>svarita</i> accent on इ in खलप्वि is by this very <i>sutra</i>, this <i>svarita</i> is to be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of यण् <i>adesa</i> of [[6.4.83]]. How can then the य् substituted for this इ be considered as <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>?\n\nAnswer:- This is considered as <i>siddha</i> by <i>asraya</i>. (आश्रयात् सिद्धत्वम्) ॥\n\nObjection :-If this be so, then उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः [[8.4.66]] should also be considered as <i>siddha</i>: and we should have <i>svarita</i> in दध्याशा &c also. For the word द꣡धि is first-acute by <i>Phit</i> Il. 3. Therefore धि is <i>svarita</i> by [[8.4.66]]. The य् is <i>svarita</i> <i>yan</i>, the <i>anudatta</i> आ after this should become <i>svarita</i> according this view, but this is not so.\n\nAnswer:- To avoid this difficulty, we have the following.\n\nVart:- यण्स्वरो यणादेशो सिद्धो वक्तव्यः ॥ \"The यण् accent should be considered as valid, for the purposes of यण् substitution\".\n\nSome say, that even in such cases as दध्या॑शा the above rule applies, and that the unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, if it follows a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i> which is preceded by an acute vowel. They quote the following from <i>Taittariya</i> <i>sakha</i> : यास्ते विश्वाः समिधः सन्त्यग्ने, where the अ of अग्ने is pronounced as <i>svarita</i>. So also in the <i>Brahmana</i> portion as : दध्या॑शयति the आ is read as <i>svarita</i>. But according to <i>Katyayana</i> and <i>Patanjali</i>, the unaccented vowel does not become <i>svarita</i> by this <i>sutra</i>, when it follows a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i> which is preceded by an acute vowel.\n\nTo get rid of these anomalies, the <i>Mahabhashya</i> proposes several alternatives, two of which will be mentioned here. The first proposal is to divide this composite <i>sutra</i> into two parts: (1) उदात्तयणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति \"an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i> when it follows after an <i>udatta</i> <i>yan</i>\". (2) स्वरितयणश्च परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति \"an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, when following a <i>svarita</i> <i>yan</i>\" and in this second <i>sutra</i>, we shall read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i> from the preceding half. So that this half will mean: उदात्तयण इत्येवं यो निर्वृत्तः स्वरितः, तस्य यणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति ॥ The <i>svarita</i> must have been obtained by the application of the first half of this <i>sutra</i> and this <i>svarita</i> should be changed to यण्, which would change the <i>anudatta</i> into <i>svarita</i>. So that the स्वरित यणः means this particular <i>svarita</i> obtained by the application of this very <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThe second proposal is not to read <i>svarita</i> into the <i>sutra</i> at all. The <i>svarita</i> in सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा would then be explained by <i>udatta</i>-<i>yanah</i> rule. सकृल्लू + इ + आशा = सकृल्ल्व् + य् + आशा ॥ Here व् is <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>. This will cause आ to become <i>svarita</i>. The intervening <i>svarita</i> य् is considered as not existent for the purposes of accent स्वरविधौव्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् ॥ Nor is this य् to be considered as <i>sthani</i>-<i>vad</i> to इ by [[1.1.57]], for in applying the rule of accent, such a substitute is not considered as <i>sthanivat</i> by [[1.1.58]].\n\nWhy do we say \" of <i>udatta</i> and <i>svarita</i>\"? Observe बैदी꣡ + आशा꣡ = बैद्याशा, so also शार्ङ्गव्याशा ॥ Here the semi-vowel replaces an unaccented ई, and is अनुदात्त यण् ॥ These words are first acute owing to नित् accent [[4.1.73]].\n\nWhy do we say \"an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>\"? Observe कुमार्यत्र, किशोर्यत्र ॥ The word अ꣡त्र is acutely accented on the first by लित् accent. [[6.1.193]].",
    "82005": "The word \"of an <i>anudatta</i>\" is understood here. An unaccented vowel, which combined with the preceding <i>udatta</i> vowel remains as a single substitute, becomes <i>udatta</i>. Thus for the <i>udatta</i> इ of अग्नि꣡ and for the case-ending औ which is <i>anudatta</i>, there is always substituted long ई single by [[6.1.102]]. This single substitute will be <i>udatta</i> according to the present sutra<i>, as अग्नी꣡ ॥ Similarly वायू꣡, वृक्षैः꣡, प्लक्षैः꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"with </i>udatta<i> vowel\"? Observe पचन्ति, यजन्ति ॥ Here पच् + शप् + अन्ति = प꣡च् + अ + अन्ति । Here शप् is </i>anudatta<i> by [[3.1.4]], so also अन्ति by [[6.1.186]]. The </i>ekadesa<i> of these two non-accented अ will be </i>anudatta<i>. In forming this </i>para<i>-</i>rupa<i> </i>ekadesa<i> by [[6.1.97]], the </i>svarita<i> of the अ of शप् caused by [[8.4.66]] is considered as invalid or </i>asiddha<i>.\n\nOther examples are क्व वोऽश्वाः (</i>Rig<i>. V. 61. 2) and क्वावरं मरुतः ॥ The word वः is </i>anudatta<i> by [[8.1.21]]. read with [[8.1.18]]. The word अ꣡श्वः is acutely accented on the first, as it is formed by adding क्वन् to अश् (</i>Unadi<i> I. 151). The स् of वस् is changed to व् [[8.2.66]], which is again changed to उ [[6.1.113]]. Thus वोऽश्वः ॥ Here अ becomes </i>purva<i>-</i>rupa<i> by (VI. I. 109), which is </i>udatta<i>. क्व is formed from किम् by अत् affix [[5.3.12]] and [[7.2.105]] and is </i>svarita<i> [[6.1.185]]. The word अ꣡वर is acutely accented on the first by the </i>Phit<i> II. 6. The single long substitute is </i>udatta_.",
    "82006": "Thus सु + उत्थितः = सू꣡त्थितः or सू॑त्थितः; वि॑ + ईक्षते = वीक्ष꣡ते or वीक्ष॑ते; वसुकः + असि = वसुकोऽ॑सि or वसुकोऽ꣡सि ॥ Here the word सु is a <i>Karmapravachaniya</i>  by [[1.4.94]], when it is compounded by प्रादिसमास with the Past Participle, the <i>Avayayibhava</i> compound retains the accent of its first member [[6.2.2]], and so it is acutely accented on the first, and the rest are <i>anudatta</i>. Thus the <i>udatta</i> उ꣡ of सु is compounded with the <i>anudatta</i> उ॒॒ of उत्थितः which stands at the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>, and so the <i>ekadesa</i> is optionally <i>svarita</i>. In वीक्षते and वसुकोऽसि also the verbs ईक्षते and असि lose all accent by [[8.1.28]] and so ई and अ become <i>anudatta</i>, which when compounded with वि and वसुका become optionally <i>svarita</i>.\n\nThe word स्वरितः is employed in the <i>sutra</i> only for the sake of distinctness, for the <i>sutra</i> may have well stood as वाऽनुदात्ते पदादौ ॥ In this form of the <i>sutra</i>, the <i>udatta</i> of the preceding <i>sutra</i> would become optional when the second member is a word beginning with <i>anudatta</i>. <i>Udatta</i> being optional, in the other alternative, where there will not be <i>udatta</i>, the <i>svarita</i> will be substituted by reason of the nearness in position.\n\nWhy do we say \"<i>anudatta</i> beginning\"? Observe देवदत्तोऽत्र ॥ Here अत्र begins with <i>udatta</i> and not <i>anudatta</i>, and hence no option is allowed.\n\nWhy do we say \"beginning of a word\"? Observe वृक्षैः, वृक्षाः, प्लक्षैः and प्लक्षाः, where <i>anudatta</i> case-endings are not beginnings of words.\n\nAccording to <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshita</i> this is a <i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>; in this wise. There will necessarily be <i>svarita</i> (1) where a long ई is the single substitute of (इ + इ) or of two short इ, (2) where there is <i>purva</i>-<i>rupa</i> by the application of एङपदान्तात् अति [[6.1.109]]. There will be <i>udatta</i> where a long vowel comes in. Thus in वि + इदम् = वीद॑म् in वी३दं॒॒ ज्योति॒॒र्हृद॑ये, the long ई is substituted for two short इ's. This substitution of a long ई for two short इ's is technically called प्रश्लेष ॥ Where there is <i>Praslesha</i>, the long ई is necessarily <i>svarita</i>. Similarly when there is अभिनिहतसन्धिः i. e. the peculiar <i>sandhi</i> taught in [[6.1.109]]. Thus ते॑ऽवदन्, सोऽय॒॒मागा॑त् ॥ So also where there is क्षैप्रः सन्धिः i.e. the substitution of a semi-vowel in the room of an <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i> vowel, as अन्या॑भि ॥ The above rules about <i>svarita</i> are thus summarised in the <i>Pratisakhyas</i> : इकारयोश्च प्रश्लेषे क्षैप्राभिनिहतेषु च ॥ But where a long ई is substituted as a single substitute for इ + ई (one of the इ's being long), there it must always be acute. As अस्य श्लोको दि॒॒वीयते (<i>Rig</i>. 1. 190. 4). The words दिवि꣡ + ईय॒॒ते॒॒ are compounded into दिवीयते ॥ The word दिवि꣡ Locative singular is finally acute by [[6.1.171]]. ईयते is from the <i>Divadi</i> root इङ् गतौ, and has lost its accent by [[8.1.28]].",
    "82007": "The word पदस्य 'of a <i>Pada</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus राजा, राजभ्याम्, राजभिः, राजता, राजतरः, राजतमः ॥ The Nominal stem राजन् gets the designation of <i>Pada</i>, before these affixes, by [[1.4.17]].\n\nWhy do we say 'of a <i>Pratipadika</i> or Nominal stem'? Observe अहन्नहिम् ॥ Here अहन् is a verb, the 3rd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) of the root हन् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'at the end'? If the word अन्तस्य had not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the <i>sutra</i> would have stood thus नलोपः प्रातिपदिकस्य; and as the word पदस्य is understood here, the <i>sutra</i> would have meant, there is elision of न्, where ever it may be, of a <i>Pada</i> called stem. So that the न of नराभ्याम् would also have required elision. In fact, the genitive case here in पदस्य is not <i>sthana</i> <i>shashthi</i>, but <i>viseshana</i> <i>shashthi</i>, a नलोप अन्तग्रहणं पदाधिकारस्य विशेषणत्वात् ॥\n\nQuestion: But even if you use the word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i>, it is compounded with the word प्रातिपदिक, and the sense of the <i>sutra</i> will be \"न् which is at the end of a <i>pratipadika</i>, which (<i>pratipadika</i>) is a portion of a <i>pada</i>\" &c. and not \"न् which is at the end of a <i>pada</i>\". So that the rule will not apply to अहन्नराभ्यां but will apply to राजानौ &c? Answer:- The word प्रातिपदिक is not compounded, with the word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i>. It is used without any case-affix, on the analogy of <i>Chhandas</i> usage. In fact, it is in the genitive case, the affix being elided by [[7.1.39]].\n\nVart:- The prohibition must be stated with regard to the elision of the न of अहन् ॥ As अहः, In अहर् the case-affix सु is <i>luk</i>-elided by [[7.1.23]], the <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> is prohibited by [[1.1.63]], and hence the न् of अहन is changed to र् by [[8.2.69]]. अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ For the rules [[8.2.68]] and [[8.2.69]] by which the final of अहन् is changed to र्, are <i>asiddha</i> with regard to this present rule requiring elision of न्, hence this <i>vartika</i>.\n\nThere is no necessity of this <i>vartika</i>, for the subsequent rules [[8.2.69]], [[8.2.68]] will debar नलोप ॥ Answer:- But रु and र are considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of न elision. The रु and र would have debarred न elision, had they otherwise found no scope. But they have their scope. Question: Where have they their scope? Answer:- In the penultimate अ i.e. in the अ preceding the न् ॥ Question: The very fact that the author has used the word अहन् in the <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.68]], shows that रु does not replace अ but न् ॥ Answer:- If so, then र will find scope in the Vocative, हे अहन् where न् is retained by [[8.2.8]], and it will be this न् which will be replaced by र्, as ह अहर् and so also हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ !\n\nThe word दीर्घाहन् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> [[2.2.24]], the Vocative affix is elided [[6.1.68]], and the न् changed to र् by [[8.2.68]], and it is changed to उ [[6.1.114]]. In हे अहन! the न् is not elided by the option of the <i>Vartika</i> under [[8.2.8]].\n\nTo remove these objections, they say, the word अहन् which is used in [[8.2.68]] is in nominative singular without the elision of न्, and it is to be repeated as अहन् अहन् ॥ The one indicates the exact form, showing that the न् is not elided; and by the second word the रु is ordained for this final न् ॥",
    "82008": "This debars the elision of न्, which otherwise would have taken place by the preceding <i>sutra</i>. The examples of non-elision, of न् in the Locative singular are to be found in the <i>Vedas</i>. As परमे व्योमन् (<i>Rig</i>. I. 164. 39), आर्द्रे चर्मन्, लोहिते चर्मन् ॥ Here the sign of the Locative, namely इ (ङि) is elided by [[7.1.39]]. In the Vocative Singular, the न् is not elided, as हे राजन्, हे तक्षन् ॥\n\nQuestion: When ङि or the Vocative is elided, the preceding stem is no longer a <i>Pratipadika</i>, and the stem does not get the designation of पद before the affix but is भ, hence where is the necessity of making the present prohibitory rule, when the elision of न् would not have taken place in the Locative and Vocative singular, by any rule ?\n\nAnswer:- The very fact of the prohibition of the elision of न्, as contained in this aphorism, indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>), that a word retains the designation of <i>pratipadika</i>, though an affix has been elided after it and though such elided affix may produce its effect ([[1.2.45]] read with [[1.1.62]]). Nor will such elided affix give the designation of <i>Bha</i> (भ) to such a stem. Thus राज्ञः पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, here the न् is elided by considering the word राजन् as a <i>pratipadika</i>, even after the elision of the Genitive affix in the compound, and it is not a <i>Bha</i>, which would have required the elision of अ by [[6.4.134]].\n\nVart:- Prohibition of the prohibition must be stated, when the Locative word is followed by another word in a compound. That is, when a compound is a Locative <i>Tatpurusha</i>, the न् is elided : as, चर्मणि तिला अस्य = चर्म तिलः ॥\n\nIn हे राजवृन्दारक ! the first member राजन् does not retain its न् by the present <i>sutra</i>, because the whole compound, as such, is in the Vocative case, and not the word राजन् ॥ In fact, there can be no compound, which in its analysis, will give the first member as a Vocative word.\n\nVart:- Optionally so in the neuter nouns. As, हे चर्मन्, हे चर्म !",
    "82009": "After a stem ending in म् or having म् as its penultimate letter, and after a stem ending in अ or आ, or having these letters as its penultimate, there is substituted व् for the म् of मतुप् ॥ First after stems ending in म्, as किंवत् (किंवान्), शंवत् (शंवान्).

Wherever in a word, the म् of मतुप् is not changed to व्, though the rules require it, that word should be classified under यवादि class.

    "82012": "The change of म् to व् in these was obtained from the last <i>sutra</i>.

Otherwise अस्थिवान् ॥ 3. चक्रीवत् is from चक्र which is changed to चक्री, as चक्रीवान् राजा ॥ Otherwise we have चक्रवान् ॥ चक्रीवन्ति सदोहविर्द्धामानि भवन्ति is a Vedic example. It means सारस्वते सत्रेजङ्गमानि सदो हविर्धानानि, न त्वेकत्रावस्थितानि, तानि तत्र तत्र कर्षणाय चक्रयुक्तानि भवन्ति ॥ 4. कक्षीवत् is from कक्ष्या, there is vocalisation of य and the lengthening is by [[6.4.2]]. कक्षीवान् is the name of a <i>Rishi</i>. Otherwise we have, कक्ष्यावान् ॥ 5. रुमण्वत् is from लवण which is changed to रुमण् ॥  Otherwise we have लवणवान् ॥ Others say, that there is a distinct word रुमन्, and the न् is not elided, but changed to ण् ॥ Or that the affix मत् takes the augment नुट् ॥ 6. चर्मण्वती is from चर्मन्, there is non-elision of न् and its change to ण् ॥ Or मत् has taken नुट् augment. The <i>Charmanvati</i> is the name of a river. Otherwise we have चर्मवती ॥",
    "82013": "It is derived from उदक 'water' with the affix मत् ॥ उदन्वान् is the name of a <i>Rishi</i>, because he controlled the rains, it rained at his command. It also means occan or that in which water is held, like तटाक &c. The affix कि is added by [[3.3.93]], and उदक changed to उद् by [[6.3.58]], and thus we have उदधिः ॥ Why do we say \"when meaning a sea\"? Observe उदकवान् घटः 'a pot having water'. Here the main idea is not that of \"holding or containing\", but simply the general fact of possessing water: a human being may also possess water in the same way.",
    "82014": "The kingdom whose king is good is called राजन्वान् देशः, राजन्वती पृथ्वी ॥ The affix मतुप् is used here in the sense of प्रशंसा or praise. Otherwise राजवान् ॥",

    "82016": "As अक्षण्वन्तः कर्णवन्तः सखायः; अस्थन्वन्तं यदनस्था बिभर्त्ति (<i>Rig</i>. I. 164. 4), अक्षण्वता लाङ्गलेन; शीर्षण्वती, मूर्द्धन्वती ॥\n\nThe word अक्षण्वत् is thus formed : अक्षि + मतुप् = अक्ष् + अन् + मत् (अनङ् is substituted for the final of <i>akshi</i> by (VII. I. 76)) = अक्षमत् (the म् is elided by [[8.2.7]]). Now we add the augment नुट् ॥ If this augment is added to मतुप्, as म्मतुप् then it becomes a portion of मतुप्, and this म् would be changed to व by [[8.3.9]] read with (I. I. 54), and not the letter म्, because म् intervenes. If we add this augment to the end of the stem, then in अक्षण्वता &c. we cannot change it to ण because of the prohibition in [[8.4.37]], and the augment being नुक्, the न् would be changed to र् by [[8.3.7]] in सुपथिन्तरः &c [[8.2.17]]. The first view, however, is the correct one and the difficulty in its acceptance is obviated by नुटोऽसिद्धत्वात् तस्य च वत्वं न भवति; ततः परस्य च भवति; as shown above.\n\nThe नुट् augment being considered as <i>asiddha</i>, is not changed to व, but the letter following it, is so changed. Thus अक्षन् (VII. I. 76) + मत् = अक्ष + मत् (the न् of the stem is elided by [[8.2.7]]. Add the augment नुट् now, and we have अक्ष + न्मत् ॥ The augment according to [[8.2.1]], is <i>asiddha</i>, so that according to [[8.2.9]], व् is substituted for म्, and not for न्, as would have been required by (I. I. 54).",
    "82017": "The affixes तरप् and तमप् are called घ ॥ Thus सुपथिन् + तर = सुपथि + तर [[8.2.7]] = सुपथि + न्तर [[8.2.17]] = सुपथिन्तरः ॥ So also दस्युहन्तमः ॥\n\nVart:- The augment तुट् is added to these affixes after भूरिदावन्; as भूरिदावत्तरः ([[3.2.74]], the affix is वनिप्).\n\nVart:- Long ई is the substitute of the final of रथिन् before तर and तम ॥ The word रथिन् is formed by the affix इनि in the sense of मतुप् ॥ The final न् is first elided by [[8.2.7]], and then for the short इ of रथि the long ई is substituted by the present <i>vartika</i>. If the long ई were substituted for the final न् of रथिन् as रथिई + तर, then this long ई being <i>asiddha</i>, it could not be compounded by <i>ekadesa</i> with the preceding इ into ई, and the form would always remain रथिईतरः ॥ As रथीतरः, and रथीतमं रथीनाम् ॥ Or this ई may be considered to have come after रथ in the sense of मतुप् ॥",

    "82019": "Thus पलायते, प्लायते ॥ Here arises the question, does the word अयति qualify the word र्, or does it qualify the word Preposition. In the first view, the <i>sutra</i> would mean, \"the र् immediately followed by अयति is changed to ल ॥\" But as a matter of fact,  र् is never immediately followed by अयति ॥ Thus in प्र + अयति or परा + अयति, the letter अ and आ intervene respectively. The <i>ekadesa</i> <i>sandhi</i> of these, will make र् immediately followed by अयति; but the <i>ekadesa</i>, being <i>sthanivat</i> will prevent it. This difficulty however, is overcome by the maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्, for otherwise the rule will be useless. For the same reasons, परि + अयते = पल्ययते, though here र् intervenes between र् and अयते ॥ In short, the intervention of one letter is considered as no intervention.\n\nIn the second view, the <i>sutra</i> would mean when a Preposition is followed by <i>ayat</i> then its र् is changed to ल, and none of these difficulties will arise with regard to the above forms. But then would arise a fresh difficulty, for the र् of प्रति would also require to be changed into ल् ॥ Some say, that प्रति is never followed by अयति; while others hold that the form प्लत्ययते (प्रति + अयते) is valid. According to the first view, the valid form is प्रत्ययते ॥ The स् of the Prepositions दुस् and निस् is changed to र्, but this र् is not changed to ल्, because it is <i>asiddha</i>: thus we have the forms निरयणम्, दुरयणम् ॥ But there is a preposition निर् also the र् of which is changed to ल्, as निलयनम् ॥ See [[7.2.46]].

In fact the words 'an affix beginning with a vowel' in the <i>sutra</i>, means \"a verbal affix beginning with a vowel,\" and not a noun affix.

Thus it is ordained in श्रेयन्र् where the present <i>sutra</i> applies, as well as पयर् where this <i>sutra</i> does not apply. But the जश्त्व rule [[8.2.39]] covers the whole ground of रुत्व, hence if जश्त्व rule were not debarred by रुत्व, the latter would find no scope.

It is, however, not done, because यण् substitution is a <i>Bahiranga</i> operation, as it depends upon two words and consequently, is considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of this rule, which depends on one word only.\n \nWhy do we say 'of a <i>Pada</i>'?

Also अमार्ट् from मृज् in लङ् the तिप् (त्) is elided by [[6.3.18]]; there is <i>vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.114]], the ज् is changed to ष् by [[8.2.36]], which is changed to ड् [[8.4.53]] and finally to ट् (चर्) ॥",

Similarly it does not apply to पयस् धावति, where स is changed to रु and then to उ [[6.1.114]] = पयो धावति ॥ The elision of स् in सग्धिः from घस् with क्तिन्, and in बब्धाम् from भस् in the Imperative with ताम्, is a Vedic diversity. But according to <i>Patanjali</i> चकाधि is the proper form; while in पयो धावति the <i>antaranga</i> रु debars this <i>bahiranga</i> स् elision.\n\nObjection:- If so, how do you form आशाध्वं, by the elision स् of शास्; for स् would not be elided? Answer:- The स् is not here elided but changed to जश् letter, by [[8.2.39]]. Objection:- If so, स् may always be changed to जश् letter, and there is no need of eliding it; in pronouncing, it will make no difference, whether you pronounce with one consonant or two, e.g. आशाद्ध्वम् or आशाध्वं ॥ Moreover by so doing, you will shorten the <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.78]], by omitting the word लुङ् from it. For the forms like अच्योड्ढ्वम्, अप्लोड्ढ्वम्, will be evolved regularly by changing स् of सिच् to ष्; and the ध after it will be changed to ढ, and then ष् changed to ड् by जश्त्व [[8.4.53]]. Answer:- So far it will be all right, but in सेट् Aorist we shall never get the alternative forms अलविध्वम् &c, though we may get the form अलविड्ढ्वम् [[8.3.79]]. Therefore, the word सिच् should be taken.\n\nObjection:- If सिच् is to be taken here, then the स् of घस् and भस् will not be dropped, and we shall not get the forms सग्धिः and बब्धां in the passages सग्धिश्च मे सपितिश्च मे, and बब्धां ते हरीधामाः ॥ Therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> should not be confined to सिच् only. Answer:- We shall explain सग्धिः by saying, that it is a word derived from सघ्, and so also बब्धां from the root बन्ध ॥\n\n[N. B.- The word सग्धिः is generally thus derived; अद् + क्तिन् = घस् + ति [[2.4.39]] = घ्स् + ति [[6.4.100]] = घ् + ति [[8.2.26]]. Had the present rule been confined to सिच्, the स् could not have been elided by [[8.2.26]]. See [[6.4.100]], where these two forms are developed]. Or we may explain these forms as Vedic irregularity, by which letters are sometimes dropped, and so घस् and भस् have lost their स् ॥ That letters are sometimes dropped in the <i>Chhandas</i>, we see in passages like the following इष्कर्त्तारमध्वरे for निष्कर्त्तारमध्वरे; तुभ्येदमग्ने for तुभ्यमिदमग्ने; आम्बानां चरुः for नाम्बानां चरुः; अव्याधिनी रुगणः or अव्याधिनीः सुगणाः ॥\n\nThe above discussion is summarised in the following\n\nKarika:- धिसकारे सिचोलोपश्चकाद्धीति प्रयोजनम्, \"This rule is confined to the elision of the सिच् only, for the sake of preserving the स् in चकाद्धि\" ॥  \n\nआशाध्वं तु कथं ? जश्त्वं सकारस्य भविष्यति ॥ \"How then do you form आशाध्वं by the elision of स्?

In अभोधिः, the स् of अभस् is not elided before धि as required by [[8.2.25]]. In द्विष्टरां the rule [[8.2.27]] does not apply. In दृषत्स्थः the rule [[8.2.26]] does not apply. In काष्ठशक्स्थिरः the rule [[8.2.29]] is non-applicable. In क्रुञ्चा the rule [[8.2.30]] does not apply. In धुर्यः (धुरं वहति) there is not lengthening by [[8.2.77]]. Thus काष्ठशक्स्थाता ॥ Here क् would require to be elided as initial in a consonant, followed by a <i>jhal</i> consonant थ ॥ काष्ठशक् is formed by adding क्विप् to शक् ॥ But according to <i>Patanjali</i>, there can be formed no valid word from शक् with क्विप्, a fortiori, no such word can be formed as काष्ठशक्स्थाता (काष्ठशकि तिष्ठति).\n\nIn वास्यर्थम्, काक्यर्थम्, the स् and क् are not elided, because य् is a <i>Bahiranga</i> substitute and <i>asiddha</i>, and the word वास्य् काक्य् are not considered as <i>Pada</i>, ending in a conjunct consonant.\n\nWhy do we say \"of स् and क्\"?

It is not so, because <i>Panini</i> himself uses this word, in this form, in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.59]]. Or because the rule is confined to सङ् affixes only. Or the root is कुञ्च् without र् and with a penultimate न्, and not ञ् as we find in <i>Dhatupatha</i> कुन्च कौटिल्याल्पी भावयोः (<i>Bhuadi</i> 200). With the elision of न we have निकुचितिः before the क्तिन् affix [[6.4.24]] कुचितः in Past Participle, and अचोकुन् ॥ In निकुचितम् we cannot have the optional कित् of the <i>Nishtha</i> by [[1.2.21]], because the elision of the penultimate न् by [[6.4.24]] preceded on the basis of the affix being कित्, thus कुन्च् + क्त = कुच् + त ॥ This elision of न्, will not make the root उदुपधा for the purposes of the application of rule [[1.2.21]], on the maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य ॥ In fact, one of the reasons on which this maxim is based, is this very fact, that the elision of न् does not make the root उपधा for the purposes of making the affix non-कित् ॥ The affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् under [[7.2.9]] (<i>vartika</i>). The word क्रुङ् is formed from this root by क्विन् affix [[3.2.59]]: the final च् is first elided by [[8.2.23]], and then ञ् is changed to ङ् by [[8.2.62]]. The rule [[6.4.24]] thus finds no scope here.\n\nIn this view of the case we say क्रुञ्च् is an irregular form of this root <i>kunch</i>, because it is so exhibited in [[3.2.59]]. There the <i>anusvara</i> and <i>parasavarna</i> change of this न् to ञ् by [[8.3.24]] being considered <i>asiddha</i>, there is no palatal ञ्, and hence there is no guttural change.",

As दग्धा, दग्धुम्, दग्धव्यम्, काष्ठधक्, दोग्धा, दोग्धुम्, दोग्धव्यम्, गोधुक्, from दह् and दुह् ॥  For the त् of the affixes तृ &c. ध is substituted by [[8.2.40]], before which, the घ becomes ग by [[8.4.53]]. For the घ in काष्ठदघ् is substituted ग by [[8.2.39]], or क् by [[8.4.56]], and द becomes ध by [[8.2.37]].\n\nWhy do we say \"of a root beginning with द\"? Observe लेढा, लेढुम्, लेढव्यम्, गुडेलिट् ॥\n\nThe force of the genitive case in धातोः is not to make it in apposition with the word दादेः, but it has the force of denoting a part as related to the whole: so that it means \"the word which begins with द and forms part of a root, for the ह of such a part is substituted घ.\" What does follow from it? The letter घ is substituted in अधोग् also, which begins with अ ॥ For without the above explanation (धातोरवयवो यो दादिशब्दस्तदवयवस्य हकारस्य &c), the घ would have come in examples like मास्म धोक्, without the augment अ, but not where there was the augment अ ॥ Moreover, that it is an अवयवयोगा षष्ठी will appear necessary in <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.37]].\n\nIf it has the force of denoting a 'portion or member', how do you explain the forms दोग्धा, दोग्धुम्, for here no portion is taken but the whole word? This will be explained on the maxim of व्यपदेशिवद् भावः \"An operation which affects something on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone, and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\". (व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन्) ॥ Or we may explain the sutra<i>, by saying 'that root which begins with द् in its original enunciation in </i>Dhatupatha<i>'? Thus in original enunciation the root is लिह् not beginning with द ॥ If a Derivative root be formed from it like दामलिह्य (दामलिहमिच्छति = दामलिह्यति), it is a root which begins with द; the ह of this Denominative root, however, will not be changed to घ, for it is not a root of </i>upadesa_. Therefore, when we add क्विप् to this root, we get दामलिट् by [[8.2.31]], and not दामलिक् ॥",

The others would not have got घ but for this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nThese roots belong to <i>Radhadi</i> sub-class of <i>Divadi</i> <i>gana</i>: and are taught there in this very order (<i>Divadi</i> 89-91). By belonging to <i>Radhadi</i> sub-division, the इट् is optional [[7.2.45]]. Instead of making the <i>sutra</i> वाद्रुहादीनाम्, this longer formation of the aphorism indicates that the rule applies to यङ्लुक् also, as दोध्रुक् or दोध्रुट् ॥ See [[7.1.6]], for if the roots were taught not specifically but by गण, then the rule would not apply to <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>.",
    "82034": "As नद्धा, नद्धुम्, नद्धव्यम्, उपानत्, परीणत् ॥ The त् of the affixes तृ &c, is changed to ध by [[8.2.40]]; and for the preceding ध is substituted द by [[8.4.53]]. उपानत् is formed by [[8.2.39]], read with [[8.4.56]]. परीणत् is formed by क्विप् as it belongs to सम्पदादि class, the lengthening is by [[6.3.116]], and ण-change by [[8.4.14]]. It would have shortened the processes of transformation, had only द been ordained in the <i>sutra</i>, instead of ध; but the ordaining of ध is for the purposes of [[8.2.40]], by which there should be ध for the participial त &c, in नद्धम्, and that there should not be the change of this <i>Nishtha</i> त into म by [[8.2.42]]. Thus नध् + त = नध् + ध [[8.2.40]] नद्धम् [[8.4.53]] But had the substitute been द, we should have नद् + त = नन्नं by [[8.2.42]].",
    "82035": "As इदमात्थ, किमात्थ ॥ The word आथ्थ becomes आत्थ by [[8.4.55]]. Why has the last mentioned substitute ध not been ordained here, for this ध would also have given the form आत्थ by चर change, as the थ is also changed to त; and by so doing there would have been only one <i>sutra</i>, instead of two i.e. आहनहो र्ध would have been enough? Making this separate substitute, is for the sake of indicating that the rule [[8.2.40]], does not apply here. For had [[8.2.40]], still applied, the substitute ध of the last <i>sutra</i> would have been enough. The त substitute, however, would have been the best.\n\nThe word झलि is understood here. Hence there is no change before vowel affixes, as आह, आहतुः, आहुः ॥\n\nVart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, भ is substituted for the ह of हृ and ग्रह ॥ Thus गर्दभेन संभरति; मरुदस्य गृभ्णाति; सामिधेन्यो जभ्रिरे, उद्ग्राभञ्च निग्राभञ्च ब्रह्म देवा अवीवृधन् ॥",

The word शब्दप्राट् is formed by क्विप्, there is lengthening and no vocalisation.\n\nThe roots राज् and भ्राज् are never followed by a <i>jhal</i> beginning affix, because such affixes will always take इट् augment. These roots are, therefore, mentioned here, for the sake of the change of their ज् to ष्, when at the end of a word. Some, however, form nouns like राष्टिः, भ्राष्टिः with क्तिन् affix from these roots by [[3.3.94]], <i>vartika</i>, and इट् augment is prevented by [[7.2.9]].\n\nOf roots ending in छ we have प्रच्छ :- प्रष्टा, प्रष्टुम्, प्रष्टव्यम्,  शब्दप्राट् ॥ According to one view, the letter छ should not be mentioned in this <i>sutra</i>: for by [[6.4.19]], छ is always changed to श, and this श will be changed to ष by the present <i>sutra</i>. Others hold, that the change of छ to श by [[6.4.19]] is confined before कित् or ङित् affixes, and therefore the mention of छ is necessary in this <i>sutra</i>; moreover the ष् substitution here, and the  श् substitution in [[6.4.19]]. refer to the conjunct letter च्छ (with the augment तुक्). For if it were not so, then छ alone being changed to ष्, the त् of तुक् would be changed to ट्, and we should have पृट्ष्टः instead of  पृष्टः ॥\n\nOf roots ending in श् we have लिश् :- लेष्टा, लेष्टुम्, लेष्टव्यम्, लिट्; विश् :- वेष्टा, वेष्टुम्, वेष्टव्यम्, विट् ॥",

From दुह् - (which becomes दुघ् by [[8.2.32]], and thus is a <i>jhash</i> ending root) धोक्ष्यते, अदुग्ध्वम्, गोधुक् ॥\n\nSo also from गृध् we have अजर्घाः the 2nd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) Intensive (<i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>). There is <i>guna</i> of ऋ, the स् (of सिप् 2nd Person Singular) is elided [[6.1.68]], and we have अजर्गर्ध्, and for the letter ग of the monosyllabic root, घ is substituted by the present aphorism. अजर्घर्ध् ॥ Then the final ध् is changed to द्, अजर्घर्द् [[8.2.39]].

Observe बोद्धा, बोद्धुम्, बोद्धव्यम् ॥\n\nWhy have we taken ध्व and not merely ध? Observe दादद्धि from दध् in the यङ् लुक्, Imperative 2nd Person singular, the हि being changed to धि [[6.4.101]]. The substitutes are four भ, घ, ड and ध, and their respective <i>sthanins</i> are also four, i. e. ब, ग, ड and द; so that ढ is the substitute of ड; but, as a matter of fact, ड never so stands at the beginning of a monosyllable, and so there is no ढ substitution.",
    "82038": "The word दध is taken in the <i>sutra</i> as the reduplicated form of धा दधाति and not the root दध धारणे of <i>Bhuadi</i> class, as शप् intervenes there. By the word च we draw in the words स and ध्व ॥ Thus धत्तः, धत्थः, धत्स, धत्स्व, धध्वम् ॥ By the express injunction of this <i>sutra</i>, the elided अ is not considered as <i>sthanivat</i>. The last <i>sutra</i> could not have applied to दध for two reasons. Ist. It does not begin with a बश् letter, for the real reduplicate is धध, and ह is merely a substitute, and is considered <i>asiddha</i>. 2ndly. The form दध does not end in a <i>jhash</i> consonant, but in a vowel अ, and though this अ is elided before these affixes, yet the <i>lopa</i> would be <i>sthanivat</i>. Hence the necessity of च in this <i>sutra</i>. See coutra, the <i>vartika</i> in <i>Mahabhashya</i>.\n\nThe word झलि is understood here, and so also झषन्तस्य; and there can be no affix, but begins with त or थ, that can come after दध् ॥ Why do we employ then the words 'before त and थ'? Had we not used these, the <i>sutra</i> would have referred to स and ध्व only, as being in immediate proximity, and the च draws them in. According to <i>Padamanjari</i> the words तथोश्च could have been dispensed with: for before स् and ध्व, the ध change would have taken place by the last <i>sutra</i>, whilst by this <i>sutra</i>, the same change would have taken place before all other झल्-beginning affixes, and such affixes that can come after दध् are त or थ-beginning affixes.\n\nThe word <i>jhash</i> is understood here also, therefore the rule applies to दध then only, when it assumes the form of दध्, by the elision of आ; and hence not here दधाति ॥",

Observe अक्षितमसि मामेक्षेष्ठाः ॥ The word अक्षितं is formed with क्त in the sense of भाव and means 'imperishable'. The <i>Nishtha</i> being added in the sense of ण्यत्, there is no lengthening of the vowel by [[6.4.60]].\n\nThe root क्षि includes the two roots क्षि क्षये and क्षि निवासगत्यौः ॥ As क्षितः कामो मया ॥ See also the commentary of <i>Sayana</i> on अक्षि॑तोतिः सनेदि॒॒मं वाजमिन्द्रः॑ सह॒॒स्रिणं॑ ॥ (<i>Rig</i> I. 5. 9). \n\nObjection:- The form क्षियः in the <i>sutra</i> is the Genitive singular of the root-noun क्षी ending in long ई, and will denote the root क्षी ending in long ई according to the maxim प्रकतिवदनुकरणं भवति \"an imitative name (as क्षी  here) is like its original (the root क्षी)\". What is then the necessity of employing the word दीर्घात् in the <i>sutra</i>? For had the root क्षि with short इ been meant, the form would have been क्षेः ॥\n\nAnswer:- The <i>dhatu</i> imitative noun though taking इयङ् [[6.4.77]] as in क्षियः, includes the <i>dhatu</i> ending in short इ also, as in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.59]], [[6.4.60]] where क्षि ending in short इ is taken.\n\nQuestion: If a root ending in short vowel may also be indicated by an imitative name, declined with the इयङ् augment, then why is the root जि exhibited in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.19]] as जेः instead of जियः i. e, the <i>sutra</i> ought to have been वि पराभ्यां जियः and not वि पराभ्यां जेः ?\n\nAnswer:- Here the word जि is not used as a <i>dhatu</i>-imitative word, there is no intention here to denote the verbal idea of the particular act connoted by the root जि; on the contrary, it simply expresses the mere form जि ॥",

Therefore we have प्रतिशीनः with न change.\n\nThe word स्पर्श is a <i>guna</i> word formed by घञ्, and denotes the particular <i>guna</i> or sensation to be sensed through the organ of touch. In this sense it is derived from the root स्पृश संस्पर्शने ॥ It also denotes a disease, derived from स्पर्श उपतापे ॥ There is nothing to show, what स्पर्श is meant in the <i>sutra</i>.

Observe, निर्वातो वातः, निर्वातं वातेन ॥\n\nIn the sentences निर्वाणः प्रदीपो वातेन, निर्वाणोऽग्निर्वातेन, the न change has taken place, because the location of the verb वा is in the प्रदीप and अग्नि, and not in the वात, which is merely an Instrument.

The same change takes place before क्तवतु also, as फुल्लवान् ॥\n\nThe affix त् is elided after the roots क्षीब्, कृश् and उत् -लाघ्, and the augment इट् is prohibited; this is the irregularity in क्षीबः, कृशः and उल्लाघः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when not preceded by a Preposition? Observe प्रफुल्लाः सुमनसः, प्रक्षीबितः, प्रकृशितः, प्रोल्लाघितः ॥ In the case of लाघ्, prepositions other than उत् are prohibited.\n\nOr the augment इट् is added, and then इत् is elided from क्षीबितः &c. See [[8.2.3]] <i>vartika</i>\n\nVart:- The forms उत्फुल्लः and संफुल्लः should be enumerated. . Here त is changed to ल, though the root has taken a Preposition.\n\nIn the word परिकृशः, the word परि is not a Preposition with regard to the verb कृश्; परिगतः कृशः = परिकृशः ॥ So that परि is <i>upasarga</i> of the verb गतः understood, hence we have the form कृशः ॥",

    "82062": "The word पदस्य is understood here. The word क्विन्प्रत्यय is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> meaning 'that stem which has <i>kvin</i> as its affix.' For the final consonant of such a stem, a guttural is substituted. As घृतस्पृक् [[3.2.58]], हलस्पृक्, मन्त्रस्पृक् ॥\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> could have been क्विनः कुः; the word प्रत्यय is used in the <i>sutra</i> to show the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound; so that the व् of क्विन् may not be changed to a guttural. Moreover this <i>Bahuvrihi</i> also indicates that the roots which take the क्विन् affix, change their final to a guttural before other affixes than क्विन् ॥ Thus the roots सृज् and दृश् take क्विन् to form स्रक् and दृक् nouns by [[3.2.59]], [[3.2.60]]. The guttural change will take place even when these roots are declined as verbs: as, मानो अस्राक् मानो अद्राक्, where अस्राक् and अद्राक् are the Aorist of सृज् and दृश् ॥ The augment अट् is not elided, though the मा is added [[6.4.75]] as a Vedic diversity. The ईट् augment also does not take place as a Vedic irregularity. The augment अम् is added by [[6.1.58]], and the vowel is lengthened by <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.3]]. Thus अट् + सृज् + सिच् + तिप् = अस्रज् [[6.1.58]] = अस्राक् [[7.2.3]] and [[8.2.62]]. Otherwise it would have been ष by [[8.2.36]]. So also in दृग्भ्यां, दृग्भिः, the श् is changed to a guttural, though the noun दृश् is a क्विप् formed noun and not formed by क्विन्; and this is so, because the verb दृश् does take क्विन् also.\n\nObjection:- If this be so, there ought to be guttural change in रज्जुसृड्भ्यां from the root सृज् with क्विप्? Answer:- The guttural change however in not desired here.\n\nIn gutturalisation, ज is changed to ग, and श to ख, which both become क by वावसाने [[8.4.56]]",

The lengthening takes place by [[8.2.76]]. and the word means सप्रीतिः ॥ The रु is र्, but it should be distinguished from it.

The word अवयाज् is also formed by ण्विन् [[3.2.72]]. Thus the three words श्वेतवाह्, पुरोडाश् and अवयाज् are formed. These words take the affix डस् before the <i>Pada</i>-terminations (See <i>Vartika</i> to [[3.2.71]]). After having taken डस्, the above forms अवयाः &c., are made in Nominative singular irregularly.\n\nWhy is this <i>nipatana</i>, when रु would have come by the last sutra_ and the lengthening would have taken place by [[6.4.14]], of the words अवयस्, श्वेतवस् and पुरोडस्? They are so exhibited here, for making them long in the Vocative singular also. For they could not have been lengthened in the Vocative singular, because [[6.4.14]] does not apply to it. Thus हे अवयाः, हे श्वेतवाः, हे पुरोडाः ॥\n\nThe word च shows that other forms, not enumerated, may also be included here under. As हे उक्थशाः ॥",

The न् of अहन् is not changed to र् in the <i>sutra</i> by [[8.2.69]], because it is intended to show the word-form अहन् ॥ The Nominal stem is <i>Pada</i> in the above examples by [[1.4.17]].\n\nVart:- Before the words रूप, रात्रि and रथन्तर, the न् of अहन् is changed to र् ॥ As अहोरूपम्, अहोरात्रः, अहोरथन्तरं साम ॥ This is an exception to [[8.2.69]].

Observe अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ Here रु-called र् replaced the final न् of अहन् ॥ The difference between this रु-called र and the ordinary र is illustrated in the above set of examples. The रु-called र is changed to उ by [[6.1.113]], the ordinary र is not so changed.\n\nObjection:- In अहर्ददाति and अहर्भुङ्क्ते the case-ending is elided after अहन्, and so by <i>Pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i>, we may say that there is a case-ending here also ? Answer:- This is not so, because of the following maxim अहो रविधौ लुमता लुप्ते प्रत्यय लक्षणं न भवति ॥ The rule of <i>pratya</i> <i>lakshana</i> does not apply to the substitution of र for the final of अहन् when the affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्. Therefore, this अहन् is not considered to be followed by सुप् or case-affix. But where an affix is elided by using the word लोप, there the rule of <i>Pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> does apply to अहन् ॥ As हे दीर्घाहोऽत्र, हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ. [[8.2.7]].

That is, when the word formed by the affix वस् ends with स्, such स् is replaced by द ॥ For a word formed by वस् does not sometimes end in स्, and in those cases the rule will not apply. As स्रंस् and ध्वंस् always end in स्, there is no necessity of qualifying these by the स् of [[8.2.66]]. अनडुह् ends in ह् and so स् cannot qualify it.\n\nThus विद्वद्भ्याम्, विद्वद्भिः, पपिवद्भ्याम्, पपिवद्भिः with वस् affix. स्रंस् :- उखास्रद्भ्याम्, उखास्रद्भिः ॥ [[7.1.70]] and [[3.2.36]]. ध्वंस् — पर्णध्वद्भ्याम्, पर्णध्वद्भिः ॥ अनडुह् — अनडुद्भ्याम्, अनडुद्भिः ॥\n\nBut when a वस् formed word does not end in स्, the rule does not apply. As विद्वान्, पपिवान् ॥ Here न् is not changed to द् ॥\n\nIn the case of वस्, the द is ordained, before any other rule manifests itself; thus in विद्वद्भ्यां this द debars रु; so why should it not debar the rule relating to the elision of the final in विद्वान् also ? This rule sets aside रु, but it does not, however, over-rule the elision-rule, because it is not directly connected with this change.\n\nWhy in अनड्वान् the न् is not changed to द्? By the very fact, that नुम् is ordained (विधान-सामर्थ्यात्), this न् will not be changed to द् : otherwise नुम् rule would become superfluous; for it would be easier to say let ह् be changed to द्, and we should get the form अनड्वाद् by this rule without नुम् ॥\n\nObjection:- Is this be so, that the नुम् is not changed to द, because of giving it a scope, then in अनड्वान् अत्र, this नुम् should not be changed into रु by [[8.3.9]]?\n\nAnswer:- No; the maxim is that that rule is set aside, with regard to which a particular rule would become useless, if not so over-ruled: but that rule is not set aside which is only an occasion for the application of another rule (यं विधिं प्रति उपदेशोऽनर्थकः सविधिर्बाध्यते, यस्य तु विधेर्निमित्तमेव नासौ बाध्यते) ॥ With regard to द change, the नुम् <i>vidhi</i> is useless (<i>anarthaka</i>), with regard to रु change, it is merely an occasion.\n\nThe word पदस्य is understood here also, so the change does not take place in विद्वांसौ and विद्वांसः ॥",

Here the इ of the <i>abhyasa</i> required lengthening, and it would not be shortened, as it is <i>asiddha</i>.\n\nAnswer:- The यण् substitute of इ here by [[6.4.82]], is treated as <i>sthanivat</i>, to इ, and therefore, the र् or व् is considered as not to be followed by a consonant, and hence there is no lengthening. Another reason is, that the यण् substitute is taught in <i>angadhikara</i> [[6.4.82]], and depends upon the affix, and is consequently <i>Bahiranga</i>, with regard to this rule of lengthening which is <i>antaranga</i>. Hence यणादेशः is considered as <i>asiddha</i>. Therefore र् and व् are not followed by a consonant (for य् is not considered as such for the above reasons).\n\nSimilarly in चतुर्यितृ formed with तृच् affix from the Denominative (क्यच्) root चतुर्य ॥ Here इट् is added before तृच् as चतुर्य + इ + तृ and then अ is elided, चतुर्य् + इ + तृ ॥ Here the elision of अ is a <i>Bahiranga</i> process, and therefore, र् is not here really penultimate, and so there is no lengthening of the vowel.\n\nIn प्रतिदीव्ना (Instrumental singular) there is lengthening by [[8.2.77]]. To the root प्रति-दिव् is added कनिन् by <i>Unadi</i> I. 156, and we have प्रतिदिवन् ॥ To this is added टा (Instrumental affix), as प्रतिदिवन् + आ, and अ is elided by [[6.4.134]], and we get प्रतिदीव्ना ॥ The lengthening takes place here, the elision of अ is not considered here as <i>sthanivat</i>, and so व् becomes penultimate. In fact, here we apply the maxim that a <i>lopa</i> substitute of a vowel is not to be considered as <i>sthanivat</i> when a rule of lengthening is to be applied (See [[1.1.58]]).\n\nQuestion:- Well, let it not be <i>sthanivat</i>, but the elision by [[6.4.134]], depends upon a case-affix, and is <i>Bahiranga</i>, and therefore <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of this rule which is <i>antaranga</i>: and so therefore, there would be no lengthening?\n\nAnswer:- The maxim of असिद्ध बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्ग should not be applied here: because it is an <i>anitya</i> rule.\n\nThe word जिव्रिः is formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix क्रिन् added to the root वॄ (जिर्), the र् being changed to व (<i>Unadi</i> V. 49). So also किरिः and गिरिः are formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix कि added to कॄ and गॄ (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 143). The Genitive Dual of which is किर्योः and गिर्योः ॥ There is no lengthening in जिव्रिः, किर्योः and गिर्योः, on the maxim that the <i>Unadi</i> formed words are primitive words and not Derivative; and so the rules of etymological changes do not apply to them (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि) ॥",

Observe अद इच्छति = अदस्यति ॥ Objection:- How can this be a valid example, as the word पदस्य is understood here, and अदस् before the affix क्य is not a <i>pada</i> [[1.4.15]]? Answer:- This indicates that the मु change takes place, even when अदस् is not a <i>pada</i>. As अमुमुय ॥\n\nVart:- It should rather be stated that the rule applies to that अदस् which has no ओ, or स् or र् ॥ So that the prohibition may apply to अदोऽत्र, अदः कुलम् ॥ The <i>visarjaniya</i> being considered as <i>asiddha</i>, this word is considered as ending in र् ॥\n\nIn order to apply the prohibition to ओ and र् also, some explain the <i>sutra</i> thus :- अः सेर्यस्य सोयमसिः, यत्र सकारस्य अकारः क्रियते ॥ \"The word असिः in the <i>sutra</i> is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, and means that in which अ is substituted for स\" ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is thus confined to the form अद derived by changing the स् into अ by [[7.2.102]]: and not to any other अद ॥\n\nWhen अदस् takes the final-substitute अद्रि by [[6.3.92]], how is this rule to be applied ? Thus by [[3.2.59]], the root अञ्च् takes क्विन् ॥ We compound it with अदस्, as अदाऽञ्चति ॥ अदस् + अञ्च + क्विन् = अद् + अद्रि + अञ्च् + क्विन् [[6.3.92]] = अदद्र्यच् [[6.4.24]]. Now there are three views, (1) the द of अद, and द्र, of अद्रि are both changed to मु by the present <i>sutra</i>; (2), the first द is not changed, but only द्र; (3) none is changed. Thus we have (1) अमुमुयङ् [[7.1.70]], (VI. I. 68), [[8.2.23]] and [[7.2.62]], अमुमुयञ्चौ, अमुमुयञ्चः ॥ (2) Secondly, अदमुयङ् अदमुयञ्चौ, अदमुयञ्चः ॥ (3) Lastly अदद्र्यङ्, अदद्र्यञ्चौ, अदद्र्यञ्चः ॥ The above verse summarises this:\n\n\"Some ordain that मु should come separately for both <i>adas</i> and <i>adri</i>, as there is double ल (in चलीक्लृप्यते); others would have मु only for the last portion which stands in proximity to the final, (i, e. for द्र); while a third class would have nowhere, because they explain असेः of the <i>sutra</i>, by confining it to: [[7.2.102]].\" The first class interpret असेः by \"that form of अदस् which has no स्\"; and they do not apply the maxim अनन्त्यविकारेऽन्त्यसदेशस्य कार्यं भवति \"when a modification is ordained with regard to some thing which is not final, the operation takes place on that only which is in proximity to the final.\" The second class apply this maxim and make मु change only for द्र which stands in proximity to the final; while the last class interpret the word असेः in a different way altogether (अः अस्य सकारस्य सोऽयम् असिः) ॥  \n\nWhy do we say दात् 'for the vowel after द'? Observe अमुया, अमुयोः, the final य as not changed to उ ॥",

In that case, we could not get the form अमी where no plural affix follows. Hence we have translated it, by saying when plurality is to be denoted.",

Whatever we shall treat hereafter will refer to the final vowel (टि) in a sentence, and it will get the <i>pluta</i> lengthening and acute accent. Thus [[8.2.83]], says \"In answer to a salutation, but not when it is addressed to a <i>Sudra</i>\". We must supply the present aphorism to complete the meaning :-\"In answer to a salutation, the last vowel of a sentence becomes <i>pluta</i> and gets the acute accent, but not when it is addressed to a <i>Sudra</i>\". As अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं । भो आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥\n\nOne <i>adhikara</i> sets aside another <i>adhikara</i>, this is the general maxim. Will therefore the <i>adhikara</i> of the present aphorism set aside the <i>adhikara</i> of the word पदस्य [[8.1.16]]? No, the <i>adhikara</i> of पदस्य has not ceased, though latent. Otherwise in भवन्तौ &c. the न् would be required to be changed to रु by [[8.3.7]]. But it does not become so, because पदस्य manifests itself there.\n\nThe employment of the word \"<i>vakya</i>\" would not debar the <i>anuvritti</i> of पद, for the final vowel of a sentence, will a fortiori be the final vowel of a word (<i>pada</i>), then what is the use of employing the word वाक्यस्य in this <i>sutra</i> ?\n\nThe word वाक्य is employed in the <i>sutra</i>, so that a word which is not the last word of a sentence, will not get the <i>pluta</i> and acute. Had the <i>sutra</i> been पदस्य टेः &c. then all the words of a sentence would become <i>pluta</i> and acute in the final. The word टि is employed to indicate that the final vowel becomes <i>pluta</i> and acute, though the word may end in a consonant.

The word प्रत्यभिवादन means, the blessing given by the superior or elder in answer to such salutation. In giving utterance to such blessing, the last vowel of the final word gets <i>udatta</i> and acute, provided that, such blessing is not pronounced on a <i>Sudra</i>.\n\nThus अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं is said by <i>Devadatta</i> to his <i>Guru</i>. The latter says भो आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥ \"<i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i> ! be thou long-lived\".\n\nWhy do we say when not referring to a <i>Sudra</i>?

So long as one's arrogance or ridicule does not become manifest, there is prolation. But when one comes to know that he is my detractor, and is really ridiculing me by a show of respect; then the reply is not a blessing, but is, in fact, a curse. Thus अभिवादये स्थाल्यहं भोः, is uttered by the detractor; and the <i>Guru</i> understanding the word <i>Sthalin</i> to be the Proper Name of the person, replies आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् ३ ॥ Then the detractor says, <i>Sthalin</i> is not my Proper Name, but an adjective, like <i>dandin</i>, viz. he who has a स्थाल or cooking pot. The <i>Guru</i>, believing this to be true, again replies, आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् but without prolation, because the word is not a Proper Noun. The other then says \"<i>O</i> Sir, it is not my epithet, it is my Proper Name\". The <i>Guru</i> now comes to learn that he is being laughed at, and so gets angry and says असूयकस्त्वं जाल्म ! न प्रत्यभिवादनमर्हसि; भिद्यस्वं वृषल स्थालिन् ! ॥ Here it is a curse, as well as a pun : i. e. \"burst thou, <i>O </i>sinner ! like unto a cooking pot (<i>sthalin</i> = <i>sthali</i>-<i>vat</i>).\n\n<i>Ishti</i>:- This prolation takes place there only, where the Proper Noun <i>Gotra</i> &c. with which the salutation was made, is employed by the <i>Guru</i> at the end of the sentence; and not where the position of the Proper Name &c. is different. Therefore not here, देवदत्त कुशल्यसि; देवदत्त आयुष्मान् एधि, for here the word <i>Devadatta</i> is not used at the end of a sentence.\n\nVart:- The prolation is optional, when भोः follows such Proper Name, or when the Person addressed is a <i>Kshatriya</i> or a <i>Vaishya</i>.

See (VIII 2. 107).\n\nAs regards अभिपूजिते we have शोभनः खल्वसि माणवका॒॒ ३ ॥  Here the final of माणवक becomes <i>anudatta</i> and <i>pluta</i>.",
    "82101": "The word अनुदात्तं is understood here. This <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>pluta</i> as well and not merely accent.\n\nThus अग्निचिद् भाया॒॒३त् 'may he shine as fire'. So also राजचिद् भाया॒॒३त् 'may be shine as a King'.  \n\nWhy do we say 'when the sense is that of comparison'? Observe कथं चिद् आहुः ॥ Here चिद् has the force of 'littleness or difficulty'.\n\nWhy do we say प्रयुज्यमाने 'when expressly employed'? Observe अग्नि र्माणवको भायात् 'Let the boy shine like fire'. Here चित् is understood, hence the rule does not apply.",
    "82102": "The word <i>anudatta</i> is understood here also.

In the first portion आसीत् is <i>pluta</i> and <i>udatta</i> by [[8.2.97]], in the second it is <i>anudatta</i> by the present <i>sutra</i>.",

    "82105": "The word '<i>padasya</i>' is understood here: and so also the word '<i>svarita</i>'. The end-vowel of a word which is not the last word in a sentence, as well as of the last word, becomes <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i>, when a question is asked, or a fact is narrated. In fact, all the words of a sentence become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i> hereby.\n\nThus in questioning we have:- आगमा॑३: पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् अग्नि भूतां॑३इ or पटा३उ ॥ Thus all words have become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i>. The final word would, in one alternative, become <i>anudatta</i> also, by [[8.2.100]], as shown under that <i>sutra</i>. The force of the word अपि in the <i>sutra</i>, is to make the final word also <i>svarita</i>, and thus this <i>sutra</i> makes [[8.2.100]] an optional <i>sutra</i> with regard to question.\n\nIn <i>akhyana</i> or narration, there is no other rule, which is debarred by this. Therefore there, all words become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i> necessarily, by the force of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus अगमा॑३न् पुर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् भोः॑३ ॥\n\nAnother view of this <i>sutra</i> is that the word अपि applies only to <i>akhyana</i>, so that in <i>akhyana</i> all words become <i>svarita</i>. But in <i>prasna</i>, the final word will not become <i>svarita</i>, but <i>anudatta</i> necessarily by [[8.2.100]]. According to this view, this <i>sutra</i> does not ordain option. This view is not adopted by <i>Kasika</i>, or <i>Padamanjari</i> or <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>.",

The present <i>sutra</i> answers that doubt. If in the analysis of these letters, अ be taken as having one <i>matra</i> (or moras), and इ and उ one <i>matra</i>, then the <i>pluta</i> इ and उ will have two <i>matras</i>, so that the whole <i>pluta</i> ऐ and औ will have three <i>matras</i>. In fact, the word प्लुत is used here as a Past Participle of प्लु, having the force of a verb; and इदुतौ प्लुतौ means इदुतौ प्लवेते i.e. वृद्धिं गच्छतः, i.e. इ and उ are lengthened. And इ and उ are lengthened to that extent, so as to make ऐ and औ of three <i>matras</i>. Thus when अ + इ and अ +  उ each has one <i>matra</i>, then the <i>pluta</i> of इ and उ will have two <i>matras</i> as we have said before. But when अ + इ (ए) and अ + उ (ओ) are considered to have अ half <i>matra</i>, and इ and उ one <i>matra</i> and a half, then इ and उ are made <i>pluta</i>, so as to have two and a half (2 1\/2)<i>matras</i> each, thus the whole of ऐ and औ, has still three <i>matras</i>. In fact, the definition of <i>pluta</i> is, that it is a vowel which has three <i>matras</i>: so that we should so prolate the vowel as to make it have three <i>matras</i>.\n\nBut according to <i>Patanjali</i>, this <i>pluta</i> of ऐ and औ has four <i>matras</i>. Thus अ + इ and अ + उ each has one <i>matra</i>. The <i>pluta</i> of इ and उ will have three <i>matras</i>. Thus अ + इ३ and अ + उ३. or the whole has four <i>matras</i>. According to this view a vowel may have four <i>matras</i> also.",

This इ and उ, in fact, are the substitutes of the second portion, which may be इ or उ, or ए or ओ ॥\n\nThis rule is not of universal application, but applies to Rules [[8.2.100]], [[8.2.97]], [[8.2.83]], and [[8.2.90]] only, according to the\n\nVart:- The scope of this <i>sutra</i> should be determined by enumerating the rules to which it applies.\n\nVart:- It should be stated that it applies to <i>sutras</i> [[8.2.100]], [[8.2.97]], [[8.2.83]] and [[8.2.90]].\n\nThus [[8.2.100]]: As अगमा३: पूर्वा३न् ग्रामा३न् अग्निभूता३इ꣡ ॥ or पटा३उ꣡ ॥ भद्रं करोषि माणवका३ अग्निभूता३इ꣡ or पटा३उ꣡ ॥ So also [[8.2.97]]: होतव्यं दीक्षितस्य गृहा꣡३इ꣡ ॥ So also [[8.2.83]], as :- आयुष्मान् एधि अग्निभूता꣡३इ꣡ or पटा꣡३उ꣡ ॥ So also [[8.2.90]]:- as.\n\nउक्षाम्नाय वशाम्नाय सोमपृष्ठाय वेधसे ।\nस्तोमैर्विधेमाग्नया३इ꣡ ॥ (<i>Taitiriya</i> <i>Samhita</i>.

The इ and उ are of course, always <i>udatta</i> : because the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>udatta</i> is current here.\n\nWhy do we restrict this sutra<i> to the above-mentioned four rules? Observe विष्णुभूते विष्णुभूते३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा आगच्छ भो माणवक विष्णुभूते ॥\n\nIn fact, the present </i>sutra<i> being confined to the above-mentioned four rules, the words अदूराद्धूते in the </i>sutra<i>, are redundant: and should not have been used. Moreover the word पदान्त should have been used in the </i>sutra<i>, for it applies to diphthongs at the end of a </i>pada<i>. Therefore, not here, भद्रं करोषि गौरिति ॥ Here गौ before the </i>sarvanamasthana<i> affix सु is not a </i>Pada<i> [[1.4.17]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when it is not a </i>Pragrhya<i>'?

III. 51. 7) हरिवो मेदिनं त्वा ॥ Here मरुत्वः is Vocative Singular of मरुत्वत् and हरिवः of हरिवत्, meaning \"he who is possessed of <i>Maruts</i> or <i>Hari</i> horses\". The म् of मत् is changed to व by [[8.2.103]]; [[8.2.15]]. The base मरुत् before this termination is <i>Bha</i> by [[1.4.19]]. The affix सु (nominative singular) is elided by (VI. I. 68); the त् is elided by [[8.2.23]], and the न् (of नुम् (VII. I. 70)) is changed to र् by this <i>sutra</i>. So also इन्द्रायाहि तूतुजानः उपब्रह्माणि हरिवः (<i>Rig</i>.

Observe हे गोमन्, हे पपिवन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix वन् should also be enumerated. The affixes क्वनिप् and वनिप् are both meant here. Its final is also changed to रु in the Vocative Singular. As यस्त्वायन्तं वसुना प्रातरित्वः ॥ The word प्रातरित्वन् is formed by adding क्वनिप् to the root इ (इण्) preceded by प्रातः ॥ See [[3.2.75]]. The तुक् is added by (VI. I. 71).\n\nVart:- The finals of भवत्, भगवत् and अघवत् are changed to रु, optionally in the secular as well as the sacred literature, and the syllable अव् of these words is changed to ओ ॥ This is a general rule, applying both in the Vedas and the <i>Bhasha</i>. Thus भवत् — हे भोः or हे भवन् ॥ भगवत् — हे भगोः or हे भगवन् ॥ अघवत् — हे अघोः or हे अघवन् ॥ Or these words भोः भगोः and अघोः are so irregularly formed by the <i>acharya</i> himself in [[7.3.17]]. These are found in other numbers than the Vocative Singular, as भो देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ, भो देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तविष्णुमित्राः ॥ It is found in connection with Feminine nouns also, as भो ब्राह्मणि ॥\n\nThe <i>adhikara</i> of the word संहितायां does not exert any apparent influence in this <i>sutra</i>. It however has influence in those subsequent <i>sutras</i>, where the change in one word is occasioned by another word on account of <i>sanhita</i> or juxta-position, as in [[8.3.7]].\n\nSee [[8.2.3]] (<i>Vartika</i> 2) by which the <i>lopa</i> is considered <i>siddha</i> in हरिवः, otherwise there would have been no उ change in हरिवो मे &c.",

The vowel अ of सम् becomes nasal; as सँस्कर्त्ता, सँस्कर्त्तुम्, सँस्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ Why have we used the word अत्र in the <i>sutra</i>? It means \"here i. e. in this division where रु is the subject of discussion\". Objection:- This object would have been gained, without using the word अत्र; since it is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> and would apply to रु ॥ Answer:- No. Here रु is taught in connection with nasal, therefore, the rule would not apply to any other context. For had अत्र not been used, we could not have known the extent of the jurisdiction (<i>adhikara</i>) of this nasal; and we might have applied the rule of nasality to those beyond the jurisdiction of रु, such as [[8.3.13]]. The employment of अत्र prevents this doubt and shows that रु and nasality are co-extensive.",
    "83003": "Thus [[8.3.9]] teaches रु substitution of म, the long आ preceding it, would have been optionally nasal by the last <i>sutra</i>. The present <i>sutra</i> makes it necessarily so.

Observe भवांश्चरति, भवांश्छादयति ॥\n\nThe word नित्य 'always' is employed for the sake of distinctness only. The very fact of making a separate <i>sutra</i>, would give it a compulsory force, even without the word <i>nitya</i>.",
    "83004": "The substitution of nasal is optional by [[8.3.2]]. When nasal is not substituted, we add an <i>anusvara</i> to such vowel. The word अन्य should be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense, i.e. अनुनासिकात् अन्यो यो वर्णः \"a letter other than a nasal\", i. e. a letter for which nasal has not been ordained, and which stands before रु ॥\n\nThus [[8.3.5]], teaches substitution of the म् of सम् an <i>anusvara</i> would be added. As संस्कर्त्ता, संस्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ Similarly [[8.3.6]], teaches रु substitution of the म् of पुम् ॥ An <i>anusvara</i> will be added here also, as, पुंस्कामा ॥ Similarly [[8.3.7]], teaches रु substitution of final म् ॥ Here also an <i>anusvara</i> will be added, as भवांश्चरति ॥\n\nSome say \"the word परः in the <i>sutra</i> means अन्यः, and so we need not supply the word अन्यः from outside\". They say अनुनासिकात् परः = अनुनासिकादन्यः; i. e. the <i>anusvara</i> takes place in that alternative when there is no nasal. That <i>anusvara</i> is an augment and not a substitute. It is an augment to the vowel which precedes रु ॥",

Thus सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्त्ता, सँस्स्कर्तुम् or संस्स्कर्तुम्, सँस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् or संस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The word is thus evolved: सम् + स् + कर्ता = सर् + स् + कर्ता [[8.3.5]]. Here rule [[8.3.15]] appears and requires to be changed to <i>visarjaniya</i>. This <i>visarga</i> may optionally be retained unchanged by [[8.3.36]]. This, however, is not done in the present instance : but the <i>visarga</i> is always and necessarily changed to स् by [[8.3.34]]. In fact, the option of [[8.3.36]] is a determinate option (<i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>) and does not apply to the present case.\n\nOr even this <i>sutra</i> may be so read as to teach the स् substitution as well. Thus, the <i>sutra</i> is समः स्सुटि with two स्, and the <i>sutra</i> will mean, \"रु is substituted for the म् of सम् before सुट्, and this रु is always changed to स्\" ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"for the म् of सम्\"? Observe उपस्कर्त्ता ॥ Why do we say \"before सुट्\"? Observe संकृति ॥\n\nVart:- For the finals of सम्, पुम् and कान् there is always substituted स ॥ There would arise anomalies, if रु be substituted. Thus संस्कर्त्ता, पुंस्स्कामा, कांस्स्कान् ॥ In fact, according to this <i>vartika</i>, रु is never substituted for सम् [[8.3.5]], पुम् [[8.3.6]] and कान् [[8.3.12]].\n\nVart:- समो वा लोपमेके ॥ Some would have the elision of the स् after सम् ॥ This <i>Vartika</i> is not given in the <i>Kasika</i>, but the <i>Padamanjari</i> gives it, and so also the <i>Mahabhashya</i>.\n\nAccording to <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshita</i> there will be 108 forms of this word संस्कर्त्ता ॥ Thus सँस्कर्त्ता and संस्कर्त्ता with the elision of स् ॥ Then with two स्, as सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्ता ॥ Then we apply [[8.4.47]] to this latter, and have three स, as सँस्स्स्कर्ता or संस्स्स्कर्ता ॥ The <i>anusvara</i> is considered to be a vowel (अच्) for this purpose. From the three nasal forms सँस्कर्ता, सँस्स्कर्ता and सँस्स्स्कर्ता, we get three more by doubling the क् by the <i>vartika</i> : शरः खयः ॥ The three forms having <i>anusvara</i>, will also double their <i>anusvara</i> in addition to क् doubling. Thus we have 12 forms in <i>anusvara</i>: and six in nasal, altogether 18 forms. Then the त will be doubled and trebled : and thus with one त, two त and three त, we have 3 x 18 = 54 forms. This will be doubled (2 x 54 = 108) when अण् is nasalised.",

Observe नॄन् भोजयति ॥ Some read the <i>anuvritti</i> of उभयथा into this <i>sutra</i>, so that it is an optional one. Thus we have नॄन् पाहि also. The nominative case in नॄन् has the force of Genitive.",

    "83012": "The <i>sutra</i> might have been कान् कानि; but the use of the longer form आम्रेडिते shows, that where there is 'doubling', and the word gets the designation of <i>amredita</i>, then the rule applies.

Here one is किं asking question, and the other is used in the sense of contempt. This word is read in the list of कस्कादि [[8.3.48]], and hence <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.37]], does not apply. Or the स् of समः स्सुटि [[8.3.5]], is understood here, and that स् is enjoined here and not  रु ॥ It should not be objected that in the preceding <i>sutras</i> also स् should be enjoined and not रु; because in those <i>sutras</i> रु is appropriate but not so here.\n\nWhy do we say 'when an <i>amredita</i> follows'?

Similarly मीढम्, उपगूढम् ॥ The change of ध into ढ by [[8.4.41]], should be considered as valid and <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of this rule, otherwise this rule will find no scope.\n\nObjection:- It will find scope before that ढ which is primary, as in श्वलिढ् + ढौकते, where ढ of ढौकते is primary.\n\nAnswer:- No. Here the first ढ will be changed to ड् by जश् rule [[8.2.39]] and so there will be no occasion to elide it. The form will be श्वलिड् ढौकते ॥ Nor is this ढ लोपः rule an <i>apavada</i> to जश्त्व rule, because it has its scope in लीढ &c. For the जश् rule depends upon one <i>pada</i>, and is <i>antaranga</i>, or being prior to this the <i>lopa</i> is <i>asiddha</i> with regard to it. Therefore जश्त्व will take place first. Moreover in लिढ् + ढ to there is similarity of sounds (श्रुतिकृतं आनन्तर्यम्); though there may not be theoretical similarity (शास्त्रकृतं आनन्तर्यम्) when the change of ध into ढ by [[8.4.41]], is considered <i>asiddha</i>. But this theoretical technical dissimilarity will be removed by the express text of the present <i>sutra</i>. But in श्वलिड् ढौकते there is neither similarity of sounds (<i>sruti</i> <i>krtamanantaryam</i>) between ड् and ढ्, nor similarity created by any technical rule; therefore ढ लोप has no scope here. It is <i>Bahiranga</i> as well as subsequent to जश् rule [[8.2.39]], and therefore doubly <i>asiddha</i>; and consequently it does not debar the जश् rule. So when ढ् is changed to ड् by जश् rule [[8.2.39]] in श्वलिड्, then there remains no sort of <i>anantarya</i>-neither of <i>sruti</i> nor of <i>sastra</i>.",
    "83014": "The <i>sutra</i> is रः रि, and not रोः रि ॥ That is रो रि is the form which रः रि and रोः रि will both assume. रः is the Genitive of र्, and रोः would be the Genitive of रु ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is not confined to रु only, but to every र् in general including रु ॥ Thus नीरक्तम्, दूरक्तम्, where it is simple र् of निर् and दुर्; and अग्नी रथः, and इन्दू रथः where it is रु (अग्निः रथः, इन्दुः रथः). The lengthening is by [[6.3.111]]. The word पदस्य is understood here, and the Genitive here has the force of विशेषण i. e. a quality, or <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i>; i. e. when रेफ is a portion of the <i>pada</i>. Thus a रेफ which is not at the end of a <i>pada</i> is also elided. Had the Genitive been construed as <i>sthana</i>-<i>shashthi</i>, then रेफ would qualify पद, and the rule would mean \"र् should be elided before a र् when at the end of a word.\" See [[8.1.16]]. But we have the elision of the penultimate र् in अजर्घर्र् the second person singular of the Imperfect of the Intensive, and we get the form अजर्घाः ॥ See [[8.2.37]]. So also अपास्पाः from स्पर्ध in Intensive, Imperfect.

Its employment here is superfluous. For letters other than अश् are खर् ॥ Before a खर् letter, the र् will be changed to <i>visarga</i> by [[8.3.15]]; and the यत्व of this rule will be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of [[8.3.15]], so there will necessarily be <i>visarga</i>. Thus अश् serves no purpose in this <i>sutra</i>, but is for the sake of subsequent ones.

Had हशि been used in [[8.3.22]], then in [[8.3.23]], हलि ought to have been used.\n\nMoreover अशि is used in this <i>sutra</i>, so that rules [[8.3.18]], [[8.3.19]] may not apply to वृक्षव् करोति ॥\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> applies to रु called र्, therefore not here प्रातरत्र, पुनरत्र ॥",

Therefore, where there is not the lighter articulation of व् and य् by the last <i>sutra</i>, there also in the other alternative the fuller sounds of व् and य् are heard. Thus there are three forms, heavy व् and य्, light व् and य् and elision of व् and य् ॥\n\nWhen व् and य् are preceded by ओ, then there is elision by the next <i>sutra</i> compulsorily.",

So that the rule may not apply to उञ् the form assumed by वेञ् by <i>samprasarana</i> as तन्त्रे उतं = तन्त्रयुतम् ॥ Objection:- उञ् could never have meant the form assumed by वेञ्, for the <i>samprasarana</i> of वेञ् is उ, the ञ् is merely indicatory. Moreover the maxim of <i>lakshana</i>-<i>pratipadokta</i> &c, will prevent the inclusion of this उञ् resulting from vocalisation, when there is a separate Particle उञ् ॥\n\nAnswer:- The word पदे is used here for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> like [[8.3.32]]. So that ङ्मुट् may come before a word beginning with a vowel, and not before a vowel which is an affix. Thus there is no double in न् in परमदण्डिना ॥ This is also a <i>nitya</i> rule, and not optional.

In <i>sanhita</i> reading, it would have made no difference practically, whether these augments were added to the end of the first, or the beginning of the second. But they are added to the end of the first, in order to indicate that [[8.4.63]], will take effect. Thus we have प्राङ्क् छेते also. This छ change of श would not have taken place had the augment क् been added to श् of शेते; because in शश्छोटि [[8.4.63]] the झय् letter must be at the end of a <i>pada</i>. So that if क् were added to  श of शेते, as क्शेते, here too श follows a झय् letter, but this झय् letter (क्) is not at the end of a <i>pada</i>, so श will not be changed to छ [[8.4.63]]. Thus श is not changed to छ in the body of a word, like विरप्शिन् though प् is a झय् letter. पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपो विरप्शिन् ॥ विरप्शिन् = महत्, formed with the Preposition वि added to the root रप्, with the <i>Unadi</i> affix शिनि ॥\n\nMoreover in प्राङ्क् साये, the स is not changed to ष by [[8.3.59]].

But being at the beginning of the second word, [[8.4.42]] would prevent this change. श्वलिट्त् + साये = श्वलिट्ट्साये, [[8.4.41]] but the correct form is श्वलिट् त्साये ॥ For the ह of श्वलिह् is ढ substituted by [[8.2.31]], which becomes ड् by [[8.2.39]], for the ध of the augment, त is substituted by [[8.4.55]], and for ड् there is ट् by the same rule.",

This view of the <i>Kasika</i>, however, is not approved by <i>Padamanjari</i>. The न् can never be changed to रु here, because त् is followed by स् which is not an अम् letter.

The <i>sutra</i> स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः [[8.4.40]] should be divided into two parts, in order to prevent ण change.

    "83032": "The word ङमः is in the Ablative singular here; and ह्रस्वात् qualifies ङमः and ङम् itself qualifies the word पदस्य understood, and thus there is <i>tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i>. Though the word पदस्य [[8.1.16]] is in the Genitive singular, yet it should be converted here into Ablative singular, because of its connection with ङमः ॥ अचि is in the Locative singular, but should be construed as Genitive singular here : it is exhibited in the 7th case for the sake of brevity, and of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. ङम् is a <i>pratyahara</i> meaning ङ, ण and न; and so also ङमुट् is a <i>pratyahara</i> containing the three augments ङुट्, णुट् and नुट् ॥\n\nIn other words ङ् is augment after ङ्, ण् after ण् and न् after म्; or that these letters are doubled practically. Thus ङुट् is the augment after a word ending in ङ्, as प्रत्यङ्ङास्ते ॥ णुट् is the augment after a word ending in ण्, as वणणास्ते ॥ नुट् is the augment after a word ending in न्, as कुर्वन्नास्ते, कुर्वन्नवोचत्, कृषन्नास्ते, कृषन्नवोचत् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'ending in ङ, ण or न'? See त्वमास्ते ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a light vowel'? Observe प्राङास्ते, भवानास्ते ॥ Why do we say \"followed by a vowel\"? Observe प्रत्यङ्करोति ॥\n\nThe <i>Mahabhashya</i> thus comments on this aphorism :-\n\nVart:- ङमुटि पदादिग्रहणम् \"The ङमुट् augment is added to a vowel which stands at the beginning of a word\". So that in दण्डिन् + आ (Instrumental Singular), नुट् is not added to आ, because it is not the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>. Then should this <i>vartika</i> be held to be necessary? No, because the word पदात् is understood here: so नुट् will not come in दण्डिना ॥ But then it will come in परमदण्डिन् + आ ॥ Because it is a compound of two nouns, and though the case-affixes have been elided, yet दण्डिन् is here a <i>Pada</i> by reason of <i>pratyaya</i> <i>lakshana</i>; and hence there should be नुट् here added to आ ॥ Answer:- This is no valid objection. दण्डिन् is not here a <i>Pada</i>, on the maxim उत्तरपदत्वे चापदादिविधौलुमता लुप्ते प्रत्ययलक्षणं न भवति \"When an affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्, the <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> rule will not apply, when the object of it is to give the designation of <i>Pada</i> to the second member of a compound, with the exception of the rule applying to the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>\". Thus in परमदण्डिन् the word दण्डिन् is not treated as a पद, because the rule to be applied is to the end here. But the second member of a compound is treated like a <i>pada</i>, when a rule is to be applied to the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>. Thus in दधिसेचौ, the second member सेच् is considered as a <i>Pada</i> for the purposes of the rule सात् पदाद्योः [[8.3.111]], and the स is not changed to ष ॥ This view proceeds upon the supposition that the word पदात् governs this <i>sutra</i>. But the <i>anuvritti</i> of पदात् ceased with (VIII. I. 27), as we stated before. How are we then to get out of this difficulty? Are we to make the above <i>vartika</i> necessary? No: because the <i>anuvritti</i> of पदे from [[8.3.21]] runs into this <i>sutra</i>. So that the <i>sutra</i> means अजादौ पदे ङमुड् भवति ॥ \"The augment ङमुट् is added to a vowel with which a <i>Pada</i> commences\". Not therefore to the case-affix आ in दण्डिना ॥",

    "83035": "The word शर्परे is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, meaning that which is followed by शर् ॥ In other words, when a sibilant follows a hard consonant, the preceding <i>visarga</i> remains unchanged.

In fact, every rule in these three chapters stands by itself, and ignores the existence of the subsequent rule. Hence [[8.3.35]] would not have been debarred by [[8.3.37]].\n\nTo get this, some divide this <i>sutra</i> into two :- (1) कुप्वोः \"The <i>visarga</i> is the substitute of <i>visarga</i> before a guttural or labial which is followed by a sibilant.\" (2) ᳵक ᳶपौच The <i>jihvamuliya</i> and <i>upadhmaniya</i> are substitutes of a <i>visarga</i> before a guttural and a labial in every other case.\"",

As पयस्काम्यात, and यशस्काम्यति; but not here, गीः काम्यति धूः काम्यति ॥\n\nVart:- स is the substitute of the <i>Upadhmaniya</i> when followed by a guttural. The root उᳶज् (आजवे <i>Tudadi</i> 20) has <i>Upadhmaniya</i> as its penultimate: though it is written in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as उव्ज the व् only represents the प् of ᳶप, and is not to be pronounced. This ᳶप is changed to स, when the final ज् is changed to a guttural, as उ स ग, and then this स् is changed to द्, as in अभ्युद्गः, समुद्गः ॥\n\nThese words, however, may be derived from the root गम with the Prepositions अभि, उत्, and सम् उत्, by adding the affix उ ॥",
    "83039": "The word अपदादौ is understood here also.

Observe अग्निः करोति, वायुः करोति ॥ How do you explain मातुः करोति, पितुः करोति? For here in पितुः &c, the स् of the affix is elided by [[8.2.24]], and the र् of पितुर् + स् is changed to <i>visarga</i>; this is not the <i>visarga</i> of an affix, and ought to be changed to ष् ॥\n\nAnswer:- The inclusion of the word भ्रातुष्पुत्रः in <i>Kaskadi</i> class [[8.3.48]] indicates by implication, that ष change does not take place of this <i>visarga</i> in पितुः, मातुः &c: the only exception being भ्रातुः ॥ The reason of this may be that the <i>visarga</i> here does not follow a simple उ, but an <i>ekadesa</i> उ (VI. I. 111).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of पुम् and मुहुस्; as पुंस्कामा, मुहुस्कामा ॥\n\nVart:- वृद्धिभूतानां षत्वं वक्तव्यम् । The <i>visarga</i> is changed to ष even when इ or उ are <i>vriddhied</i>; as नैष्कुल्यम्, दौष्कुल्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- प्लुतानां तादौ च ॥ The <i>visarga</i> is changed to ष even when इ or उ are <i>pluta</i>, and then before dentals as well as gutturals and labials.

Observe चतुष्कपालम्, चतुष्कण्टकम्, where ष is compulsory by [[8.3.41]]. चतुर्षु कपालेषु संस्कृतः [[4.2.16]] and [[4.1.88]]. This <i>sutra</i> is an example of <i>ubhayatra</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. With regard to चतुर् the <i>visarga</i> is a non-affix <i>visarga</i>, and hence [[8.3.41]], would have made ष compulsory, this makes it optional. With regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् the <i>visarga</i> is that of an affix (सुच् or स् [[5.4.18]]), and hence [[8.3.41]], would not have applied. Thus with regard to चतुर् it is a <i>Prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, and with regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् it is an <i>Aprapta</i> <i>vibhasha</i>. \n\nWhy have we used the words '<i>dvis</i>, <i>tris</i> and <i>chatur</i>'? Objector's answer: so that the rule may not apply to पंचकृत्वः करोति, the <i>visarga</i> of <i>kritvasuch</i> [[5.4.17]] is not changed to ष् ॥\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of उ and इ is understood here from [[8.3.41]]: so that the <i>visarga</i> must be preceded by इ and उ for the application of this rule. In पञ्चकृत्वः the <i>visarga</i> is preceded by अ, and so there is no applicability of this rule.\n\nIn fact, by reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of इदुदुपधा into this <i>sutra</i>, and qualifying the <i>visarga</i> by the further epithet of 'belonging to a word that has the sense of <i>kritvasuch</i>'; we may dispense with the words द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरिति from the <i>sutra</i>. The simple <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोर्थे would have been enough. For there are no other Numerals that have a penultimate इ or उ, except these three. The chief objection to this view is, that in चतुर् the <i>visarga</i> is not the affix सुच्, but a portion of the word (See [[5.4.18]]): so the rule would not apply to <i>chatur</i>, if this word were not expressly mentioned.\n\nThe various objections and their solutions are given in the following verses.\n\nकृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्माच्चचतुष्कपाले मा\nषत्वं विभाषया भूम्ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥\nसिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे ॥\nलुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥\nएवं सति त्विदानीं द्वित्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥\nअन्यो हि नेदुदुपधः कृत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति ॥\nअक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत ॥\nचतुरो न सिध्यति तथा रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥\nतस्मिंस्तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति ॥\nप्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि विशेषणं न्याय्यम् ॥\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्मात्? Why does the author teach षत्व when these words have the sense of Numeral-adverbs? In other words, why the word कृत्वोर्थे is used at all in the <i>sutra</i>? There is no necessity of using it at all, because द्विस्, त्रिस् are clearly adverbs as they are formed by the affix सुच् [[5.4.18]] and चतुर् being read in their company will also denote the adverb <i>chatur</i>, in which सुच् has been elided [[5.4.18]]. So that all these three words are सुच्-formed, and all सुच्-formed words have the sense of <i>Krtvasuch</i>. One answer to this is that the rule of साहचर्य does not always hold good, as in दीधीवेवीटाम् [[1.1.6]], the words दीधी and वेवी are verbs, while इट् is an augment. Though therefore द्विस् and त्रिस् are <i>krtvortha</i> words, yet चतुर् need not be so: and may be a simple Numeral. Answer: चतुष्कपाले मा षत्वं विभाषया भूत् ॥ The word कृत्वोर्थे is employed to indicate that there should be no optional षत्व in चतुष्कपालं ॥ The षत्व here is compulsory by [[8.3.41]]. Question: ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥ Well this would be valid by the previous <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.41]]. That is, let in चतुष्कपाल also there be optional षत्व, as चतुःकपाल and चतुष्कपाल ॥ Now rule [[8.3.41]] will apply to चतुःकपाल and will change this <i>visarga</i> to ष, so that with regard to चतुष्कपाल, we shall have always ष ॥ Answer:- सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे, लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि । If [[8.3.41]] be considered as applying here (<i>siddha</i>), then when the affix सुच् is elided after चतुर्, and the र is changed to <i>visarga</i>, then the adverb चतुः also ends with a non-affix <i>visarga</i>, and will come under the compulsory षत्व rule of [[8.3.41]]; for though we may have optionally two forms as चतुः करोति and चतुष्करोति, by the present <i>sutra</i>, yet in the former the <i>visarga</i> would be changed to ष by [[8.3.41]]. Hence the necessity of employing the word कृत्वोर्थे ॥ Question: But we say that the र् in the adverb चतुर् is that of सुच्, thus चतुर् + स् = चतुर् + र् [[8.2.66]] = चतु + र् (the first र् is elided by [[8.3.14]]) = चतुर्; and that this र् when changed to <i>visarga</i>, will be an affix-<i>visarga</i> and so [[8.3.41]] will not apply to the adverb चतुर् ॥ Answer:- No. For उ would require to be lengthened by [[6.3.111]]. and the form would be चतूर् ॥\n\nएवं सति त्विदानीं द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥ If this be so, then what is the purpose served by using the words द्विस् त्रिश्चतुरिति in the aphorism? The simple <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे would have been enough. Because (अन्योहि नेदुदुपधः कुत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति) there are no other numeral adverbs than these three which have a penultimate इ or उ ॥\n\nअक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत । If we do not use the words <i>dvis</i>, <i>tris</i>, <i>chaturiti</i> in the <i>sutra</i>, then the word<i> krtvorthe</i> would qualify the word <i>visarga</i>, and the <i>sutra</i> would mean \" the <i>visarga</i> of an affix which has the sense of <i>kritvasuch</i> is changed optionally to ष\" ॥ The result of this will be that (चतुरा न सिध्यति तथारेफस्य विसर्जनीयोहि) it will not apply to चतुः where the <i>visarga</i> is that of र् and not of the affix सुच् ॥\n\nTherefore by using <i>dvis</i> &c, the word कृत्वोर्थे would qualify चतुर् (तस्मिन् तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति) ॥\n\nAnswer:- प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि, विशेषणं नाय्यम् ॥ Though we may not use <i>dvis</i> &c, the word <i>krtvortha</i> will not qualify <i>visarga</i>, but will qualify the word पद whose context runs here; and the rule of तदन्त will apply; so that the <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे will mean, पदस्य कृत्वोर्थे वर्त्तमानस्य यो विसर्जनीयः, तस्य सकारः षकारो व ॥ \"The <i>visarga</i> of that word which is employed in the sense of a Numeral adverb, is optionally changed to स् or ष् before a guttural or a labial, provided that such <i>visarga</i> is preceded by इ or उ\".\n\nThe above is the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>, who considers the words <i>dvis</i> &c, as redundant. The <i>Kasika</i> however controverts this opinion. According to him, if these words were not used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the mere <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे would be insufficient for the <i>visarga</i> of चतुः though used as an adverb, the षत्व will be compulsory by [[8.3.41]]; for the present <i>sutra</i> will be considered as <i>asiddha</i> or non-existent for the purposes of [[8.3.41]], (See [[8.2.1]]). But this however may be answered by saying that the rule of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् applies in these chapters, with this modification, one subject-matter is considered as <i>asiddha</i> with regard to another subject-matter gone before; but one aphorism is not considered <i>asiddha</i> with regard to a previous aphorism, when belonging to the same subject matter. (प्रकरणे प्रकरणमसिद्धं न योगे योगः) ॥ Therefore the present <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.43]], would not be considered <i>asiddha</i> with regard to [[8.3.41]]. Or the present <i>sutra</i> may be considered as an <i>apavada</i> to [[8.3.41]]: and an <i>apavada</i> is never <i>asiddha</i> with regard to an <i>utsarga</i>.",
    "83044": "The ष is understood here. Thus सर्पिष्करोति or सर्पिः करोति, यजुः करोति or यजुष्करोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when the two words are correlated'? Observe तिष्ठतु सर्पिः, पिब त्वमुदकम्, where सर्पिः is not in construction with पिब, but with तिष्ठतु ॥\n\nThe word सामर्थ्ये here means व्यपेक्षा or mutual relation of two words; and not \"having the same meaning\", or it may mean both. In fact सामर्थ्य is equivalent to आकाङ्क्षा i.e. the syntactical want of another word to complete the sense. It does not here mean 'compound'. For it being a पदविधिः the word समर्थः is understood here (समर्थः पदविधिः (II. I. 1)). The employment of the word सामर्थ्य here indicates that it is a different <i>samarthya</i> from that of [[2.1.1]]. It does not denote एकार्थीभावः or ऐकार्थ्य which is the <i>samarthya</i> of compounds where two or more words denote one object. The <i>samarthya</i> here means <i>vyapeksha</i>, which is thus defined नानाभूतयोः, पदार्थयो र्यौ शब्दौ, तयो र्यो योगः \"the syntactical union of two words expressing two different ideas\".",

Observe परमसर्पिः कुण्डिका, परमधनुः कपालम् ॥ The option even of the last sutra does not apply to these examples.\n\nQuestion: The word सर्पिस् is derived from the root सृप् by adding the <i>Unadi</i> affix इसि (<i>Unadi</i> II. 109), and यजुस् by the Unadi affix उसि (<i>Unadi</i> II. 117), therefore on the maxim प्रत्ययग्रहणे &c, the word इसुसोः would denote the mere forms सर्पिस् and यजुस् and not forms like परमसर्पिस् &c. then what is the necessity of employing the word अनुत्तरपदस्थस्य in the <i>sutra</i>?\n\nThe very employment of the word <i>anuttara</i>-<i>pada</i>-<i>sthasya</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, is an indicator (<i>jnapaka</i>), that the restriction of the following maxim does not apply with regard to the affixes इस् and उस् : प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहित स्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम् \"an affix denotes, whenever it is employed in Grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added and ends with the affix itself\". This maxim not applying, we have परमसर्पिष्करोति or परमसर्पिः करोति by the previous <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.44]].\n\nQuestion: Why is not there option in the case of compounds also by the previous <i>sutra</i>?\n\nAnswer:- Because the word सामर्थ्य there means व्यपेक्षा, and therefore does not apply to compounds.",

As तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकां आनय ॥ So also when there is correlation, as इदं सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ Here सर्पिस् is an incomplete word. The ष change, will take place even where there is no compounding. Where there is no compounding, and there is complete want of correlation, even there the ष will invariably come. And where there is correlation, but no compounding there the ष would have been optional by [[8.3.44]], but it becomes invariable here, on account of these words being so listed. Thus we have these cases : (1) Without correlation, as तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकामानय ॥ (2) Where there is correlation, as इदं  सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ (3) Where there is composition, as सर्पिष्कुण्डिका ॥ (4) Where there is no composition and no correlation even, as, in example (1).

Hence the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> for the intervention of certain letters.",
    "83059": "The word cerebral is understood here from [[8.3.55]], as well as स ॥ The <i>sutra</i> <i>adesa</i>-<i>pratyayoh</i> is in the Genitive case. The force of the Genitive however is different in the word <i>adesa</i>, from what it is in <i>pratyaya</i>. In the first it is <i>samanadhikarana</i>-<i>shashthi</i>, in the latter <i>avayava</i>-yogashashthi<i>. That is that स् which is an </i>adesa<i>, and that स् which belongs to an affix. If we took it as </i>avayavayoga<i> </i>shashthi<i> in both places, then the </i>sutra<i> would mean \"of that स् which is a portion of a substitute, or of an affix,\" and there would arise the following anomaly. In doubling a word by [[8.1.1]], one view is that two are substituted in the room of one (See [[8.1.1]]). Thus बिसंबिसं, मुसलंमुसलं ॥ Here the स् in these words, is a portion of a substitute, and would be changed to ष्, if we translate the </i>sutra<i> as above.\n\nIf we take the other view, and translate the </i>sutra<i> as \"of that स् which is a substitute or an affix\", we land on the following anomaly. We must have forms like करिस्यति and हरिस्यति, and not the correct forms करिष्यति, हरिष्यति; for here स is not an affix, but a portion of an affix. In fact, with regard to affixes, the </i>sutra<i> would be confined to those affixes only which consist of a single स्, such as सिप् in the Vedic subjunctive लेट् ॥ That this is the proper interpretation of the </i>sutra<i> is indicated by the </i>sutra<i> [[8.3.60]], (the next aphorism). The substitute घस् is taken in this </i>sutra<i>. If therefore, the force of Genitive in आदेशस्य was = आदेशस्य यः सकारः and not = आदेशः यः सकारः, then there would have been no necessity of including the substitute घस् in the </i>sutra<i>, for then the present </i>sutra<i> would have covered the case of घस् also. Similarly, if the force of the Genitive in प्रत्ययस्य was = प्रत्ययः यः सकारः, and not = प्रत्ययस्यः यः सकारः; then there would have been no necessity of excluding the affix सात् [[5.4.52]] from the operation of the present rule by [[8.3.111]], because it is not an affix consisting of a single letter स् ॥\n\nHaving surmised this, we shall now give illustrations. First of that स् which is a substitute. It can only be the स् which replaces the ष् of a root in </i>Dhatupatha<i>. Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप ॥ Of an affix, we have अग्निषु, वायुषु, कर्तृषु, हर्तृषु; वक्षत् in इन्द्रो मा वक्षत्; and यक्षत् in स देवान् यक्षत् ॥\n\nIn the case of वक्षत् and यक्षत्, the स् is not the portion of an affix, but the whole affix itself: the present </i>sutra<i> should therefore not apply to this स् ॥\n\nAnswer:- Here we apply the maxim व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन् ॥\n\nThese words (वक्षत् and यक्षत्) are from the roots वच् and यज्, in लेट् with तिप्, the इ is elided by [[3.4.97]], the augment अट् [[3.4.94]], the affix सिप् by [[3.1.34]]; the च् of वच् is changed to a guttural, and the ज् of यज् to ष् and then to a guttural.\n\nThe </i>Unadi<i> word अक्षरं (अश् + सर् </i>Unadi<i> III. 70) complies with this rule, but not so the word कूसरं and धूसरं (</i>Unadi_ III. 73) formed with the same affix सर ॥",
    "83060": "Thus अन्वशिषत्, अन्वशिषताम्, अन्वशिषन्, the Aorist of शास्; the च्लि is replaced by अङ् [[3.1.56]], and the आ changed to इ by [[6.4.34]]. So also शिष्टः, शिष्टवान् ॥ From वस् we have उषितः, उषितवान्, उषित्वा ॥ The <i>Samprasarana</i> takes place by (VI. I. 15) as it belongs to <i>yajadi</i> class. From घस् we have जक्षतुः, जक्षुः in the Perfect. घस् is the substitute of अद् [[2.4.40]], the penultimate अ is elided by [[6.4.98]]. So also अक्षन् in अक्षन्नमीमदन्त पितरः (<i>Rig</i>. I. 82. 2). This is the Aorist form of अद्, the घस् is substituted for अद् [[2.4.37]] the Aorist sign is elided by [[2.4.80]].\n\nThis <i>sutra</i> is made to cover cases not governed by the last <i>sutra</i>, namely, where the स् is not an <i>adesa</i>. Though the स् in घस् is the स् of a substitute, yet it is not governed by the preceding aphorism, because the word आदेशस्य there means 'the स् which is a substitute'. Here स् is not a substitute, but a portion of a substitute. The non-substitute घस् is not to be taken here : as it seldom occurs.\n\nThe word इण्कोः is understood here also. Therefore the rule would not apply to शास्ति, वसति and जघास ॥",
    "83061": "This rule is confined to the Desideratives of स्तु and of स् beginning roots in the Causative, provided that the Desiderative sign स् is changed to ष् ॥ The rule applies to the स् of the substitute, and not to the affix स् as there can be no such स् after a reduplicate syllable. Therefore स् means that स which replaces the ष् of the roots.\n\nThus from स्तु we have तुष्टूषति ॥ Here the स of सन् is changed to ष by the last <i>sutra</i>, and therefore so also after the reduplicate उ, the स of स्तु is changed to put ष ॥\n\nOf the Causatives of roots beginning with ष् in <i>Dhatupatha</i>, we have सिषेवयिषति, सिषिञ्जयिषति, सुष्वापयिषति ॥ In this last, the व् is changed to उ by [[7.4.67]].\n\nThough this ष change would have taken place by the previous <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.59]], yet the separate enunciation of this rule indicates that this is a <i>niyama</i> aphorism - the ष change takes place only in these cases of स्तु and Causatives of Desideratives under the conditions mentioned in this <i>sutra</i>, and no where else. Thus सिसिक्षति from the root षिच क्षरणे (<i>Tudadi</i> 140). This is a root, which is exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with a ष, therefore the form ought to have been सिषिक्षति by [[8.3.59]], but it is not so, because of the <i>niyama</i> of the present <i>sutra</i>. So also सुसूषते from षूङ् प्राणिप्रसवे (<i>Divadi</i> 24): and सुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे (<i>Tudadi</i> 115).\n\nIf this is a <i>niyama</i> rule by the very fact of its separate enunciation, what is then the necessity of using the word एव in the aphorism ? Answer:- इष्टतोऽवधारणार्थम्; so that, the <i>sutra</i> may mean \"if स्तु and Causatives only, when षण् follows\" ? and not \"if स्तु and Causatives when षण् only follows\". In the latter view, we could not get the form तुष्टाव; and the rule would have applied to सिसिक्षति also.\n\nWhy do we say \"in the Desiderative ष\"? So that the <i>niyama</i> may not be any where else. Had षणि not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, the restriction would have been with regard to every affix, and the <i>sutra</i> would have meant \"if there is occasion of षत्व change after a reduplicate, it should take place only in the case of स्तु and the Causatives\". Therefore ष change would not have taken place in सिषेव, as it is not a Causative.\n\nQuestion:- को विनतेऽनुरिधः ? Why have we used the word षण् with ष्, and not the word सन्? That is, what compulsion was there to exhibit the Desiderative affix सन्, in this changed form? The word विनत is the name given in the <i>Pratisakhyas</i> to ष and ण change.\n\nAnswer:- So that the restrictive rule may not apply to the अविनत form of सन् ॥ As सुषुप्सति ॥ The सन् is here कित् by [[1.2.8]], and there is vocalisation by [[6.1.15]]. For had सनि been used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the restriction would have been with regard to all Desideratives in general, whether the सन् was changed to ष or not. Therefore as there is restriction of [[8.3.59]], in the case of सिसिक्षति where स is not changed to ष; so there would have been restriction in सुषुप्सते, the स् could not have been changed to ष् by [[8.3.59]]. Similarly in तिष्ठासति ॥\n\nQuestion:- What is the necessity of exhibiting षण् with the <i>anubandha</i> म्? So that the rule should not apply to ष in general, but to the Desiderative affix ष only. As सुषुपिष इन्द्रम् ॥ This सुषुपिषे is the Perfect of स्वप्, the affix थास् is added as <i>Chhandas</i> irregularity instead of थल्; for थास् there is से, the affix is कित् by [[1.2.5]], and so there is vocalisation by [[6.1.15]], and reduplication, and the augment इट् is added by [[7.2.13]], the ए is changed to अय्, as सुषुपिषय् इन्द्रं, the य् is elided by [[8.3.19]]. Here after the reduplicate सु, the स् is changed to ष, in षु by the general rule [[8.3.59]], as the restriction of this <i>sutra</i> does not apply in this case. But had ष in general been taken, then सुषुपिष has an affix ष, and\ntherefore <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.59]], would have been restricted, and there would have been no change of सु to षु after the reduplicate, as it is not a causative. Hence षण् has been employed with an <i>anubandha</i>.\n\nWhy do we say 'after a reduplicate'?\n\nAnswer:- So that this restriction may apply to that ष which would have been caused by the इ or उ of an <i>abhyasa</i>, and not to that which would have been caused by an <i>upasarga</i>. As अभिषिषिक्षति, though without the Preposition, the form is सिरिक्षति ॥\n\nQuestion:- No, this cannot be the reason, because the ष caused by the <i>upasarga</i> is considered as <i>asiddha</i>, and hence there would be no restriction.\n\nAnswer:- Then we say, the <i>abhyasa</i> is taken to be qualified by सन्, namely that <i>abhyasa</i> which is caused by सन्, would give occasion to this rule and not any other <i>abhyasa</i>. Therefore if a reduplication has been caused by यङ्, and then षण् is added to it, then the restriction of the present <i>sutra</i> will not apply, and षत्व change will take place though the root may not be a Causative &c. Thus the यङ् of स्वप् is सोषुप्य [[6.1.19]], the Desiderative of this root is सोषुपिषते, with इट् augment, the elision of अ [[6.4.48]] of य, the elision of य् by [[6.4.49]].\n\nQuestion:- No this also cannot be the reason : because the षत्व change is <i>antaranga</i>, while the restriction <i>niyama</i> is <i>Bahiranga</i>. Therefore, the word <i>abhyasa</i> is employed superfluously in the <i>sutra</i>.\n\nAnswer:- The word <i>abhyasa</i> is taken in the <i>sutra</i>, so that the restriction may be with regard to that ष which might have been caused by the इ or उ of the <i>abhyasa</i>; and not to that ष which might be occasioned by the इ or उ of a <i>dhatu</i> or verbal root. Thus प्रतिषिषति, अधीषिषति ॥ Here the root इ in the sense of बोधन, is turned to Desiderative with सन्; and by [[6.1.2]], the स is reduplicated, then by [[7.4.79]], the अ is changed to इ ॥ Thus इसिस; here by the force of the इ of the <i>abhyasa</i> सि, the स is changed to ष as इसिष; [[8.3.59]] then as the restriction of this <i>sutra</i> does not apply, the root इ causes the षत्व of the <i>abhyasa</i>, as इषिष ॥ Had the word अभ्यासात् not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, the स of <i>abhyasa</i> could not have been changed to ष, for then the <i>sutra</i> would have meant \"ष is substituted for स, only in the case of स्तु and Causatives in the Desiderative षण्\"; and as इसिष is not a Causative-Desiderative, the restriction would have applied.",
    "83062": "The स substitute of स् debars the cerebral change. In other words, the स of these roots remains unchanged. As सिस्वेदयिषति, सिस्वादयिषति and सिसाहयिषति ॥",
    "83063": "The root सित् occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.70]]. Thus [[8.3.65]] teaches ष change: as अभिषुणोति, परिषुणोति, विषुणोति, निषुणोति ॥ So also when अट् intervenes; as अभ्यषुणोत्, पर्यषुणोत्, व्यषुणोत्, न्यषुणोत् ॥ The force of अपि is that the change takes place even when the augment अट् does not come, i. e. in cases other than the augment.",
    "83064": "The words प्राक् सितात् are understood here also. The स्यादि roots are, स्था, सेनय &c in [[8.3.65]] and ending with सेव् in [[8.3.70]]. The <i>sutra</i> consists of two sentences : (1) The षत्व takes place in स्था &c. even when a reduplicate intervenes; (2) The स of the reduplicates of स्था &c. is changed to ष ॥ The first is a <i>vidhi</i> rule, and the second is a <i>niyama</i> rule.\n\nThus परितष्ठौ where the <i>abhyasa</i> त intervenes. This applies even to roots other than those which have been taught with a ष in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>. As अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति (सेनया अभियातुमिच्छन्ति). This applies moreover to reduplicates which end in अ, as अभितष्ठौ; here the स् would not have been changed to ष (by [[8.3.59]]) as it is not preceded by इ or उ ॥ Another raison d'etre of this <i>sutra</i> is that it prohibits षण् [[8.3.61]]. As अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥\n\nThe word अभ्यासस्य is for the sake of <i>niyama</i>, as we have said above. स of स्था &c. and of no other roots is changed to ष ॥ As अभिसुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे with सन्, the augment is debarred by [[7.2.12]]: the root स् is unchanged by the <i>niyama</i> prohibition of [[8.3.61]]; the reduplicate स् remains unchanged by the restriction of the present <i>sutra</i>.",
    "83065": "Thus अभिषुणोति, परिषुणोति, अभ्यषुणोत्, पर्यषुणोत् ॥ सुवति, अभिषुवति, परिषुवति, अभ्यषुवत्, पर्यषुवत् ॥ स्यति, अभिष्यति, परिष्यति, अभ्यष्यत् । पर्यष्यत् ॥ स्तौति, अभिष्टौति, परिष्टौति, अभ्यष्टौत् ॥ स्तोभति, अभिष्टोभते, परिष्टोभते, अभ्यष्टोभत, पर्यष्टोभत ॥ स्था, अभिष्ठास्यति, परिष्ठास्यति, अभ्यष्ठात्, पर्यष्ठात्, अभितष्ठौ, परितष्ठौ ॥ सेनय, अभिषेणयति, परिषेणयति, अभ्यषेणयत्, पर्यषेणयत् ॥ अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति ॥ सेध, अभिषेधति, परिषेधति, अभ्यषेधत्, पर्यषेधत् ॥ सिच, अभिषिञ्चति, परिषिञ्चति, अभ्यषिञ्चत्, पर्यषिञ्चत्, अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥ सञ्ज, अभिषजति, परिषजति, अभ्यषजत्, पर्यषजत्, अभिषिषङ्क्षति, परिषिषङ्क्षति ॥ ष्वञ्ज, अभिष्वजते, परिष्वजते, अभ्यष्वजत, पर्यष्वजत, अभिषिष्वङ्क्षते, परिषिष्वङ्क्षते ॥ सेध इति शब्विकरणनिर्द्देशः सिध्यति निवृत्त्यर्थः ॥ उपसर्गादिति, किम्? दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति, निगताः ॥ सेचका अस्माद्देशान्निः सेचको देश इति ॥ नायं सिचेरुपसर्गः ॥ अभिसावकीयतीत्यत्रापि न सुनोतिं प्रति क्रियायोगः किं तर्हि सावकीयं प्रति ॥ अभिषावयतीत्यत्र तु सुनोतिमेव प्रति क्रियायोगो न सावयतिमिति षत्वं भवति ॥\n\nThe root सिध् is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> as सेध with शप् <i>vikarana</i>, thus debarring सिध् — सिध्यति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after an <i>upasarga</i>\"? Observe दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति [[8.3.111]]. So निःसेचको देशः = निर्गता सेचका अस्माद् देशात् ॥ Here निः is not an <i>Upasarga</i> to सिच्, but to the noun सेचक ॥ Similarly in अभिसावकीयति, the <i>upasarga</i> अभि is not added to the root सु (सुनोति), but to the third derivative of सु (सुनोति), Namely, from सु we derive सावक with ण्वुल, and from सावक we form the Denominative root सावकीय with क्यच्; and to this Denominative root अभि is added. The <i>upasarga</i>, however may be added to the root first, and then ण्वुल् and क्यच् added. In that case, the rule will apply. As अभिषावकीयति ॥ So also with the Causative, as अभिषावयति, for here the <i>upasarga</i> is added to the root सु and not to the causative form सावय ॥\n\nThe roots षुञ् अभिषवे belongs to <i>Svadi</i> class, षु प्रेरणे to <i>Tudadi</i> class, षोऽन्तकर्मणि to <i>Divadi</i> class, ष्टुञ् स्तुतौ to <i>Adadi</i> class and ष्टुभ स्तंभे, to <i>Bhuadi</i> Class. These have been shown in the <i>sutra</i> in their declined form in order to indicate that the rule does not apply to their यङ लुक्, as अभिसोषवाति ॥ See [[7.1.6]] for this rule of श्तिप् exhibited roots. On the other hand, the roots सिच् &c. being not so exhibited, change their स in यङ् लुक् also, as अभिषेषिचीति ॥\n\nThe <i>upasarga</i> need not end with इ and उ for the purposes of this rule. Thus निष्षुणोति, दुष्षुणोति, where the <i>upasarga</i> is निस् and दुस् ॥",
    "83066": "The word सदिः is in the first case, but has the force of genitive. Thus निषीदति, विषीदति, न्यषीदत्, व्यषीदत् ॥ निषसाद, विषसाद ॥ The second स remains unchanged in the Perfect by [[8.3.118]].\n\nWhy do we say 'but not after प्रति'? Observe प्रतिसीदति ॥ Prof. Bohtlingk points out that the <i>sutra</i> is सदेरप्रतेः as given by <i>Sayanacharya</i> in his commentary on <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI. 13. I. <i>Panini</i>, however, often uses the first case with the force of the Genitive, as in [[8.3.80]].",

    "83068": "The word आलम्बनं means \"support, refuge, that upon which any thing depends or leans\". आविदूर्य means \"the state of not being विदूर or far off, i.e. to be contiguous\".\n\nThus अवष्टभ्यास्ते \"He remains leaning upon a staff\" &c, अवष्टभ्य तिष्ठति ॥ So also in the sense of to be near, as अवष्टब्धा सेना 'the army near at hand'. अवष्टब्धा शरत् ॥ See [[5.2.13]].\n\nWhy do we say \"when having the sense of support or contiguity\"? Thus अवस्तब्धो वृषलः शीतेन 'the <i>Sudra</i> is afflicted with cold'.\n\nThe present <i>sutra</i> is commenced in order to make the ष change even while the preceding letter is not इ or उ ॥",

Thus अनुस्यन्देते or अनुष्यन्देते मत्स्योदके ॥ The subject here is a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, and it is not in the singular number because of [[2.4.6]]. The word अप्राणिषु is a <i>Paryudasa</i> and not a <i>Prasajya</i>-<i>pratishedha</i>. If it be the latter sort of prohibition, then the force will be on the word living, and in a compound like मत्स्योदके, consisting of living and non-living beings, the prohibition will apply because it has a living being in it, and so there will be no षत्व ॥ In the other view, the force is on the word non-living, and because the compound contains a non-living being, therefore the option will be applied, and the presence of the living being along with it will be ignored.\n\nThe <i>anuvritti</i> of परि, नि and वि is understood here from [[8.3.70]]. So these words could well have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i>, which might have then been अन्वभिभ्यांच स्यन्दतेरप्राणिषु, and by the force of च we would draw in the <i>anuvritti</i> of परि &c.",

Observe परिवेविषीध्वम्, from विष्लृव्याप्तौ of the <i>Juhotyadi</i> class. There is <i>Guna</i> of the reduplicate by [[7.4.75]], the स् of सीयुट् is elided by [[7.2.79]], and षीध्वम् here is made up of the ष् of the root विष्, and ईध्वम् the affix; therefore षीध्वम् here is not after the <i>anga</i> परिवे वि, for the <i>anga</i> here is परिवे विष्, and ईध्वम् is the affix. This result could have been obtained, without using the word अङ्गात् in the <i>sutra</i>, by the maxim अर्थवद् ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य \"a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning, denotes that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote a combination void of meaning\".",

If the stem does not end in an इण् vowel, the rule will not apply; as आसिषीध्वम् from the root आस उपवेशने ॥\n\nThen in the word उपदिदीयिद्ध्वे, will the cerebral change not take place by the option of this <i>sutra</i> or otherwise? This is from the root दीङ् क्षये in the Perfect with the augment इट् (VII. 2. 13.), and युट् (by VI. 4. 63). Some say that as the augment युट् intervenes between the stem ending in ई (इण् vowel), and the augment इट्, therefore this rule will not apply and there will not be the optional ढ ॥ Others hold that the <i>anuvritti</i> of अङ्गात् has ceased, and the <i>anuvritti</i> of इण् is only current, in this <i>sutra</i>, and there is no intervention and so there will be the optional change into ढ ॥",

Thus where <i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i> are names of two boys, or where they refer to physical fire and herb.

In fact, the word पितुर् is so exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> itself, with a र्, the word मातुः therefore, by the rule of साहचर्य is also to be understood as a र् ending word.\n\nQuestion:- Well, if this be so, when this र् is changed to a <i>visarga</i>, and the <i>visarga</i> changed to स् by [[8.3.36]], then there would be no ष change ?\n\nAnswer:- The ष change would take place both after the <i>visarga</i>-ending or स-ending words, on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् \"That which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means, in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place\". Therefore, these words are taken to end in र् ॥ For if they were taken to end in स्, then the rule would not apply when they ended in a <i>visarga</i>. If they be supposed to end in a <i>visarga</i>, then the form पितुर्भ्याम् with a र् before भ्याम् in the <i>sutra</i> is hard to explain.\n\nThe word समासे is understood here also. Therefore not here मातुः स्वसा when the words are used separately in a sentence.",
    "83086": "As अभिनिष्टानो वर्णः, अभिनिष्टानो विसर्जनीयः or अभिनिस्तानो वर्णः or विसर्जनीयः ॥ The compound preposition अभि-निस् causes this change, and not any one of them separately. Thus <i>Apastamba</i> :- द्व्यक्षरं चतुरक्षरं वा नामपूर्वमाख्यातोत्तरं दीर्घभिनिष्टान्तं, घोषवदाद्यन्तरन्तस्थम् \"a name (<i>nama</i>) should be such that it should consist of two-syllables or four-syllables, that its first portion should be a noun (<i>nama</i>-<i>purva</i>), and its second portion a verb (<i>akhyata</i>), that it should end in a long vowel (<i>dirgha</i>) or a <i>visarga</i> (<i>abhinishtana</i>), that the first letter of such a noun should be a <i>ghosha</i> or sonant letter (<i>ghosha</i>-<i>vad</i>-<i>adi</i>), and a semi vowel (<i>antastha</i>) should be in the body of it.\" Thus the names द्रविणोदा, वरिवोदा fulfill these conditions and are good names.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is the name of a particular letter.\"? Observe अभिनिस्तनति मृदङ्गः ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of समासे ceases from this place.",
    "83087": "The word यच् परः means 'followed by य् or अच्' ॥ The word प्रादुः is an Indeclinable, meaning 'evidently'.\n\nThus अभिषन्ति, निषन्ति, विषन्ति, प्रादुःषन्ति; अभिष्यात्, निष्यात्, विष्यात्, प्रादुःष्यात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when preceded by an <i>Upasarga</i> having an इ or उ?\" Observe दधिस्यात्, मधुस्यात् ॥ Why do we say 'of the verb अस्'? Observe अनुसृतम्, विसृतम् ॥\n\nQuestion:- How is there any occasion for the application of the rule here? The context here relates to स, and the word \"<i>upasarga</i>\" qualifies that स, but here the <i>upasarga</i> is not applied to स् but to the whole verb सृ, therefore this is no counter-example. In fact, what is the necessity of using the word अस् at all in the <i>sutra</i>: for even without it, the word '<i>upasarga</i>' would qualify that verb which consists of स् only, and such a verb is अस्, with its अ elided and no other verb? Nor is the employment of अस् necessary for प्रादुः, for it comes only in connection with the verbs कृ, भू and अस् ॥\n\nAnswer:- All that you urge, is true, yet the following counter-example should be given, as अनुसू, the son of <i>Anusu</i> will be आनुसेयः with ढक् as it belongs to <i>Subhradi</i> class. Thus अनुसू + ढक् = आनुसू + एय = आनुस् + एय ॥ Here the ऊ is elided by [[6.4.147]]. Now when ऊ is elided, the स् is the only verb-element that remains, अनु is <i>upasarga</i>, and एय is affix; so that had अस् not been taken in the <i>sutra</i>, the rule would apply to this स् also.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is followed by a vowel or य्\"?

Answer:- सुपेः षत्वं स्वपेर्मा भूत्, so that the षत्व change should not take place in स्वप् form, as विस्वप्नः and विस्वप्नक् [[3.2.172]] ॥ Question:- विसुष्वापेति केन न? For what reason the षत्व change has not taken place in the reduplicate विसुष्वाप, for here also in the reduplicate, is the form सुप्, as विसुप्स्वप्, and then by applying हलादिशेष rule, the प् is elided, and एकदेशविकृतस्थानन्यत्वात् applies? Answer:- हलादि शेषान् न सुपिः, we reduplicate the form स्वप्, as विस्वप्स्वप् and then elide प्, as विस्वस्वप्, and then vocalise, as विसुस्वप् so that there being no form सुप्, there is no षत्व ॥ इष्टं पूर्वं प्रसारणं, in fact, the vocalisation takes place first, and then elision according to an <i>ishti</i>. See (VI 1. 17). Otherwise, in स्वप् स्वप्, as प् is elided, व् would also have been elided. Why is the स of विसुष्वाप not changed to ष by [[8.3.64]], स्थादीनां नियमो नात्र प्राक् सितादुत्तरः सुपि, the rule [[8.3.64]] does not apply, because that rule is confined only to verbs up to सित in [[8.3.70]], while सुप् is after that verb. Moreover the प् of सुप् being elided, the mere सु is अनर्थक, and the maxim is अर्थवद् ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य ॥ Question:- If this maxim is applied, how do you form विषुषुपुः? Answer:- अनर्थके विषुषुपुः षुपिभूतोद्विरुच्यते, here the form षुप् is doubled, and not सुप् ॥ The root is first joined with the affix वि + स्वप्, then there is vocalisation विसुप्, then there is ष change, as विषुप्, then reduplication, as विषुप्षुप् ॥ Now षत्व being considered <i>asiddha</i>, the doubling should take place first? No, for we have already shown that for the purposes of doubling, the षत्व change is not <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.3]] <i>Vartika</i>))",

    "83107": "Thus अभी षु णः सखीनाम् (<i>Rig</i>. IV. 31. 3) ऊर्द्धं ऊ षु णः (<i>Rig</i>. I. 36. 13). The lengthening takes place by [[6.3.134]], and न changed to ण by [[8.4.27]].",
    "83108": "Thus गोषाः (<i>Rig</i>. IX. 2. 10), formed by the affix विट [[3.2.67]], the न् is elided by [[6.4.41]]. So also नृषाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when it loses its न्'? Observe गोसनिं वाचमुदीरयन् (<i>Atharvaveda</i> III. 20. 10). Here the affix is इन् [[3.2.27]]. See however गोषणिं in <i>Rig</i>. VI. 53. 10.\n\nThough this ष change would have taken place by [[8.3.106]] also, the separate enumeration is for the sake of <i>niyama</i> or restriction. Some however read the word गोसनिः in the list of सवनानि words [[8.3.110]], and they hold that the proper counter-example is सिसानयिषति ॥ So also सिसनीः formed by adding क्विप् to the Derivative root सिसनिस, thus सिसनिस + क्विप् = सिसनिस् (the अ is elided by [[6.4.48]]) + 0. add सु, सिसनिस् + स् = सिसनिस् + 0 [स् is elided by [[6.1.68]]. Now the final स् (of the Desiderative affix सन्) is liable to be changed either to ष् or to र् (रु). The ष being <i>asiddha</i>, the रु change takes place.] = सिसनिर् = सिसनीः (the lengthening is by [[8.2.76]]). Here the Desiderative affix सन् is not changed to ष, hence this word is not governed by [[8.3.61]]. This being the object of this <i>sutra</i>, there will be ष change in शिषाणयिषति in the Causative.",
    "83109": "Thus पृतनाषाहम्, ऋताषाहम् ॥ Some divide this <i>sutra</i> into two; as (1) सहेः; (2) पृतनार्त्ताभ्यां च ॥ So that the rule may apply to ऋतीषहः also. The word ऋति is lengthened by [[6.3.116]], in <i>sanhita</i> : and the ष change takes place in <i>sanhita</i> only. Otherwise the form is ऋतिसहम् ॥ The word च 'and' in the <i>sutra</i> includes words other than those not mentioned in it. The word ऋतीषहं would be valid by this also.",

The <i>Padadi</i> स refers to those verbs which in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> are taught with a ष, and for which a स is substituted. This also is an exception to [[8.3.59]].

Because सिच् is one of the roots taught in [[8.3.65]], and therefore, as this latter rule prevents the operation of [[8.3.111]] i. e. पदादि स so far as it goes, so it would prevent also the operation of this rule and the form ought to be अभिषेषिच्यते ?\n\nAnswer:- The ष ordained by [[8.3.65]] prevents only the operation of पदादि स of [[8.3.111]], and the स of this rule. Therefore the present prohibition is of universal application.\n\nWhy do we say in the Intensive. Observe अभिषिषिक्षति ॥",
    "83113": "Thus अभिसेधयति गाः, परिसेधयति गाः ॥ This is an exception to [[8.3.65]].\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to drive'? Observe शिष्यमकार्यात्प्रतिषेधयति ॥ Here the sense is that of preventing or prohibiting.",

    "83116": "The root स्तम्भ required ष change by [[8.3.67]], and the roots सिव and सह by [[8.3.70]]. Thus पर्यतस्तम्भत्, अभ्यतस्तम्भत् ॥ सिव :- पर्यसीषिवत्, न्यसीषिवत् ॥ सह :- पर्यसीषहत्, व्यसीषहत् ॥\n\nVart:- This prohibition refers to the ष change that is caused by an <i>Upasarga</i> and not to the reduplicate change, as we have illustrated in the above example.",
    "83117": "Thus :- अभिसोष्यति, परिसोष्यति, अभ्यसोष्यत्, पर्यसोष्यत् ॥\n\nWhat example will you give under Desiderative? सुसूषति ॥ This is not a valid example, for by [[8.3.61]], the reduplicate will not be changed here. Then we shall give the example अभिसुसूषते ॥ This is not also a proper example, for it is governed by the restrictive rule of [[8.3.64]]. Then this is the example of अभिसुसूः, निसुसू derived from the desiderative root अभिसुसूषति by the affix क्विप् ॥ Here the desiderative affix सन् is not changed to ष [[8.3.61]] and therefore the second स would have been changed to ष as it comes after a reduplicate.\n\nWhy do we say before स्य and सन् ॥ Observe सुषाव ॥",
    "83118": "In the Perfect, when these words are reduplicated, there are two स's, as ससाद and सस्वंज ॥ After a preposition, the first स will be changed to ष, but not so the second. Thus अभिषसाद, परिषसाद, निषसाद, विषसाद, परिषस्वजेः, परिषस्वजाते, परिषस्वजिरे, अभिषस्वजे ॥ The nasal of स्वंज is elided though here, the लिट् affix is not कित्, because it ends in a compound vowel [[6.4.24]], [[1.2.5]] and [[1.2.6]].\n\nThe word स्वंज does not occur in the <i>sutra</i>, but has been inserted in it by the author of <i>Kasika</i> from the following <i>Vartika</i>:- सदो लिटि प्रतिषेधे स्वञ्जे रूपसंख्यानं कर्तव्यम् ॥",

It is, in fact, a general rule and applies to verbs other than these two. As व्यस्तौत्म् न्यष्टौत्, अभ्यष्टौत or अभ्यस्तौत ॥",
    "84001": "These letters must be parts of the same <i>pada</i> or word, one being the 'occasion' for the application of the rule as regards the other. As आस्तीर्णम्, विस्तीर्णम्, अवगूर्णम् ॥ So also after ष; as कृष्णाति, पुष्णाति, मुष्णाति ॥\n\nThe letter ष् is included in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent <i>sutras</i> : for न् will be changed into ण् when preceded by ष् by rule [[8.4.41]] of this Chapter, as well.\n\nWhy do we say \"when occurring in the same word?\" Observe अग्निर्नयति, वायुर्नयति ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the letters ऋ ॥ As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम्, मातॄणाम्, पितॄणाम् ॥\nThis <i>vartika</i> may well be dispensed with: because the र in the <i>sutra</i> is the common sound र which we perceive both in र and ऋ; and so the र will denote both the vowel ऋ and the consonant र. See contra. [[8.2.42]]. Objection:- But if even this be so, the letter ऋ has three parts, its first part is a vowel, in the middle is the र् sound of a quarter <i>matra</i>, and a vowel sound at the end. This vowel-sound will intervene between the र-sound and the subsequent न, and will prevent the application of the <i>sutra</i>, hence the <i>vartika</i> is valid ?\n\nAnswer:- This vowel-sound will be no intervention, because it will be included in the exception अट् of the next <i>sutra</i>. Objection:- The vowel-sound at the end of ऋ is not a full vowel of one <i>matra</i>, but is of half-<i>matra</i>, being only a fragment of ऋ, and hence is not included in the <i>pratyahara</i> अट्, it has no separate स्थान or प्रयत्न or homogeneity with any vowel. Hence this vowel-sound will prevent the application of this rule. Answer:- The ण change, however, does take place in spite of such intervention of a fragment of a letter, as we know from the <i>jnapaka</i> of [[8.4.39]]. In the <i>kshubhnadi</i> list there we find नृनमन as an exception, implying that न is generally changed to ण after such a fragmentary interposition. Or we may take नृनमन as a <i>jnapaka</i>, that after the letter ऋ also the ण change takes place.",
    "84002": "The <i>pratyahara</i> अट् stands for vowels and the letters ह य व र. Thus करणम्, हरणम्, किरिणा, गिरिणा, कुरुणा, गुरुणा &c.\n\nThe कु means all the gutturals, e. g. अर्केण, मूर्खेण, गर्गेण, अर्घेण ॥\n\nThe पु means all the labials, e. g. दर्पेण, रेफेण, गर्भेण, चर्म्मणा, वर्मणा ॥\n\nThe आङ् means the particle आ : e. g. पर्याणद्धम् from नह् [[8.2.34]] निराणद्धम् (cf [[8.4.14]]. The particle आ is a vowel and so included in अट् <i>pratyahara</i>. Its specification in the <i>sutra</i> shows that the restriction of the rule to the letters occurring in the same word, does not apply in the case of आङ्, in which case the rule applies to letters separated by another word.\n\nSo also when the <i>anusvara</i> separates the letters e. g. वृंहणम्, वृंहणीयम् ॥\n\nIt is from the root वृहिवृद्धौ, the नुम् is added, because the root is इदित [[7.1.58]] and न् changed to <i>anusvara</i> by [[8.3.24]]. Question:- Well the intervention is here by <i>Anusvara</i> and not नुम्, why is then नुम् taken in the <i>sutra</i>?\n\nThe word नुम् in the <i>sutra</i> refers to <i>anusvara</i>, and must be taken co-extensive with it. Otherwise the rule would not apply to words like तृंहणं from तृंह स्तृंह हिंसार्थे ॥ Here the <i>anusvara</i> is not the substitute of the augment नुम् but an original <i>anusvara</i>. Even where there is an augment नुम्, but where it is not changed into <i>anusvara</i>, the rule does not apply. As प्रेन्वनम्, प्रेन्वनीयम् from इविः प्रीणनार्थः ॥\n\nThe rule will apply even when these letters are combined in any possible way, or occur singly. As अर्केण, here a guttural and a vowel i. e. 2 letters come between र and न ॥ See [[8.3.58]] in the case of ष ॥",
    "84003": "As द्रुणसः, वार्द्ध्रीणसः (a kind of antelope), खरणसः, शूर्पणखा ॥ See [[5.4.118]] and (IV. I. 58).\n\nWhy do we say \"when a Name\"? Observe, चर्मनासिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when 'not ending in the letter ग'? Observe; ऋगयनम् ॥\n\nSome say, that this <i>sutra</i> is a नियम or a restrictive rule, and not a विधि or original enunciation, so that the substitution takes place, only when the word is a Name, and not otherwise. A compound is one word or समानपद, though composed of two or more words or पद ॥ Therefore by [[8.4.11]] the न will always be changed into ण when preceded by र or ष. But the present <i>sutra</i> restricts its scope, to those cases only, when the compound denotes a Name, as not in चर्मनासिका ॥ The word पूर्वपद is a relative term and connotes an उत्तरपद ॥ The present <i>sutra</i> therefore applies to those cases where the र् or ष् is in the पूर्वपद, and न occurs in the उत्तरपद ॥ It therefore, does not apply to तद्धित words, nor when both the letters occur in the पूर्वपद ॥ In the case of a <i>Taddhita</i>, there is a पूर्वपद, but there is no properly speaking उत्तरपद ॥ Thus खरपस्यापत्यं = खारपायणः [[4.1.99]]. Here the affix अयन is equivalent to अपत्यं, and खरप is the <i>Purvapada</i>. But the affix अयन not being a <i>Pada</i>, we cannot call it an <i>uttara</i> <i>pada</i>. Hence न will be changed into ण though खारपायण is not an Appellative but a generic term. So also मातृभोगाय हितः = मातृभोगीणः with ख affix. Similarly in करणप्रियः, the words र and न both occur in the <i>Purvapada</i> and are not affected by this rule, but by the general rule [[8.4.1]]. So also the proviso relating to ग, only prohibits the change of न into ण, but does not prohibit the restrictive character of this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nAccording to others, this <i>sutra</i> is an original enunciation or a <i>Vidhi</i> rule, and not a <i>Niyama</i> rule. They say that the word समानपद in [[8.4.1]] is equivalent to नित्यं पदं i. e. a word integral and indivisible into component words. In other words, समानपद means, a 'simple-word'. The present <i>sutra</i> therefore enunciates a new rule for a \"compound-word\". For in a compound or समास, there being a division of पूर्वपद and an उत्तरपद, we cannot say that a compound is a समानपद or indivisible word. Hence this <i>sutra</i> is a विधि ॥\n\nThe <i>sutra</i> should be thus divided :- पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायाम् one <i>sutra</i>, and अगः another. So that every rule relating to ण change would be debarred with regard to ग intervention.",
    "84004": "The words पूर्वपदात् and संज्ञायाम् of the last <i>sutra</i>, are to be read into this aphorism. Thus पुरगावणम्, मिश्रकावणम्, सिध्रकावणं, कोटरावणम्, अग्रेवणम् [[2.2.31]] शारिकावणम् ॥\n\nThe lengthening of the finals in the above is by [[6.3.117]]. Though the word अग्रेवणं is not a Name, yet the rule [[6.3.9]], applies to it and the case-affix is not elided, because it is so read in <i>Rajadantadi</i> list [[2.2.31]].\n\nThe substitution of ण for न would have taken place by the preceding rule. The separate enunciation of the rule with regard to the word वन, shows that this is a restrictive or नियम rule. The न of वन is changed into ण, when preceded by these words only and no other. Thus कुबेरवनं, शतधारवनम्, असिपत्रवनम् ॥",
    "84005": "Thus प्रवणे यष्टम्; निर्वणे प्रतिधीयते, अन्तर्वणे, शरवणम्, इक्षुवणम्, प्लक्षवणम्, आम्रवणम्, कार्ष्यवणम्, खदिरवणम् and पीयुक्षावणम् ॥\n\nThe words प्रवणं and निर्वणं are प्रादिः compounds. अन्तर्वणं is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> in the sense of a case-affix. The rest are Genitive compounds.",
    "84006": "<i>Karika</i>:-\n\nफली वनस्पतिर्ज्ञेयो वृक्षाः पुष्पफलोपगाः ।\nओषधः फलपाकान्ता लता गुल्माश्च वीरुधः ॥\n\nWhen the <i>purvapada</i> is a word denoting ओषधि or a perenniel herb, or denoting a वनस्पति or a tree, and it has a change-producing letter, then the न of वन is replaced by ण ॥ This is an optional rule. Thus :- दूर्वावनम् or दूर्वावणम्; मूर्वावणम् or मूर्वावनम् ॥ Here दूर्वा and मूर्वा are names of ओषधि ॥ Similarly शिरीषवनं or शिरीषवणम्; बदरीवणं or बदरीवनं ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies when the first word is a dissyllabic or trisyllabic word. Therefore the change does not occur in देवदारुवनम्; भद्रदारुवनम् ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition should be stated with regard to the words द्वारका &c. As द्वरिकावनम्, तिमिरकावनम् ॥\n\nThough there is a distinction, botanically speaking, between वृक्ष and a वनस्पति also; yet in this <i>sutra</i>, the word वनस्पति includes वृक्ष also.\n\n<i>Karika</i>:- Technically speaking वनस्पति is a tree that bears fruit apparently without a flower, as a fig tree <i>udumbara</i>. वृक्ष is a tree that bears both flower and fruit, ओषधि is an annual herb, that dies after the ripening of the fruit, and creepers and tubercles are called वीरुधः ॥",
    "84007": "Thus पूर्वाह्णः \"fore-noon\"; अपराह्णः \"after-noon\".\n\nWhy do we say \"ending in अ\"? Observe, निरह्नः, दुरह्नः ॥\n\nThe word अह्न is substituted for अहन् by [[5.4.88]]. The word अह्न being used in the <i>sutra</i> as ending in अ, the rule does not apply to other words. Thus दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥ The word अह्नः in the <i>sutra</i> is in the nominative case, and should not be construed as the genitive of अहन्, because all <i>sthanins</i> are exhibited in Nominatives as, वनं [[8.4.4]], वाहनं [[8.4.8]], यानं &c. The compounding takes place by [[2.2.1]], then is added the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् [[5.4.91]], and अह्न substitution by [[5.4.88]]. The word दीर्घाह्नी is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound and not a <i>Tatpurusha</i>, and hence the affix टच् does not apply to it. The feminine ङीप् is added by [[4.1.28]], there is elision of अ of अहन् by [[6.4.134]].",
    "84008": "Thus इक्षुवाहणम् 'a sugar-cart'. शरवाहणम् \"a reed-cart\". दर्भवाहणम् 'a hay-cart'.\n\nThe thing which being placed on a cart is carried, is called आहित ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"denoting the thing carried\". Observe दाक्षिवाहणम् \"a vehicle belonging to <i>Dakshi</i>\".\n\nThe word वाहन is formed by adding ल्युट् to वह्, and lengthening of the penultimate is valid by the <i>nipatana</i> of this <i>sutra</i>.",
    "84009": "The word पान is formed by the affix ल्युट् [[3.3.113]]. Thus क्षीरपाणा उशीनराः = क्षीरपाणं येषां 'the milk-drinking <i>Usinaras</i>'. सुरापाणाः प्राच्याः 'the wine-drinking <i>Prachyas</i>'. सौवीरपाणा बाह्लीकाः \"the <i>sauvira</i>-drinking <i>Bahlikas</i>\". कषायपाणा गान्धाराः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"when denoting a country\"? Observe दक्षिपानं the drink of the <i>Dakshis</i>.\n\nThe words उशीनर and the rest are applied to persons also through the medium of being country-names.",
    "84010": "Thus क्षीरपाणम् or क्षीरपानम् \"drinking of milk\" कषायपानम् or कषायपाणम् 'drinking of <i>kashaya</i>'. सुरापाणम् or सुरापानम् &c are examples of भाव or condition.\n\nSimilarly क्षीरपाणः of क्षीरपानः कंसः 'a vessel for drinking milk'. This is an example of करण or instrument.\n\nVart:- Optionally so in the case of गिरिनदी &c. Thus गिरिनदी or गिरिणदी; चक्रनदी or चक्रणदी, चक्रनितम्बा or चक्रणितम्बा ॥",
    "84011": "Thus, to take the case a प्रातिपदिकान्त first. माषवापिणौ or माषवापिनौ from माषवापिन् '<i>masha</i>-sowing' formed by णिनि under [[3.2.81]].\n\nTo take the example of a नुम् augment माषवापाणि or माषवापानि, व्रीहिवापाणि or व्रीहिवापानि nominative plural neuter. The augment नुम् is here added by [[7.1.72]] from माषान् वपयन्ति = माषवाप with कर्मणि अण्, the plural शि is added by [[7.1.20]], and then नुम् ॥\n\nTo take the विभक्ति or case-termination, माषवापेण or माषवापेन, व्रीहिवापेण or व्रीहिवापेन ॥\n\nThe word प्रातिपदिकान्त means 'final in a <i>Pratipadika</i>'. But here it means 'final in a <i>pratipadika</i> which is a second member, of compound, the first member containing the cause of change'. Therefore the change does not take place in गर्गाणां भगिनी = गर्गभगिनी \"the sister of <i>Garga</i>\". But गर्गभगिणी if the word is derived from गर्गभगः 'the share of <i>Garga</i>', with the adjectival affix इन्, feminine इनी, meaning, \"enjoying the share of <i>Garga</i>.\" In this case, like the word मातृभोगीणः 'fit to be possessed by a mother': the change will invariably take place.\n\nThe word माषवापिणि or ०नी is to be understood to have a final न्, the affix being added afterwards in accordance with the following maxim :- [[2.2.19]]. \"It should be stated that <i>Gatis</i>, <i>Karakas</i>, and <i>Upapadas</i> are compounded with bases that end with <i>krit</i>-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter\" गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः ॥\n\nTherefore the composition takes place first with the word ending in the <i>krit</i> affix, as माषवापिन् (माष + वापिन्), and thus the second term वापिन् is a <i>Pratipadika</i> which ends in न्, and so the rule is applied to it, when the feminine affix is added.\n\nSimilarly नुम् is not considered as the end portion of the second member of the compound, but as the end-portion of the full compound word.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the words युवा &c. As आर्ययूना [[6.4.133]] vocalisation), क्षत्रिययूना ॥ प्रपक्वानि is a <i>gati</i>-<i>samas</i>, दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥",
    "84012": "Thus वृत्रहणौ and वृत्रहणः 'the <i>Vritra</i>-killer'. क्षीरपाणि 'Drinkers of milk' : सुरापाणि 'drinkers of wine' : being examples of नुम् [[7.3.88]], क्षीरापेण and सुरापेण are examples of case-terminations.\n\nWhy the letter ण is repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, while its <i>anuvritti</i> was understood from the context? It is repeated in order to show that this is not an optional rule, but an obligatory rule. In fact, it shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of वा 'optional' ceases, and does not extend further.",
    "84013": "If the second part of a compound contains a letter of the class क्, the change is obligatory, even though the second part be not monosyllabic. As वस्त्रयुगिणौ, वस्त्रयुगिणः, स्वर्गकामिणौ, वृषगामिणौ ॥ नुम् :- वस्त्रयुगाणि, खरयुगाणि ॥ विभक्ति :- वस्त्रयुगेण, खरयुगेण ॥\n\nThe word वस्त्रयुगिणौ is a compound of वस्त्र with युगिन् (the affix इनिis added first to युग and then the word so formed is compounded with <i>vastra</i>). Thus the न् becomes प्रातिपदिकान्त i.e. it becomes the final of a Nominal-stem, which stands as a second member in a compound.",
    "84014": "The word णोपदेश means a root which is enunciated in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with an initial ण ॥ Thus प्रणमति 'he bows'. परिणमति, प्रणायकः 'a leader' परिणायकः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"after an <i>Upasarga</i>\"? Observe प्रनायकः = प्रगता नायका अस्माद् देशात् 'a country without a leader'. Here the word प्र is not an <i>upasarga</i>, but a mere <i>nipata</i>. See [[1.4.57]], [[1.4.58]] and [[1.4.59]]. In fact, प्र is <i>upasarga</i> here with regard to गत understood, and not with regard to नी ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"even when it is not a compound?\" Because by context, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word पूर्वपद, which is current throughout this subdivision, would have been understood in this <i>sutra</i> also, and the rule would have applied to <i>samasas</i> only, for there only we have <i>purvapada</i>. By using the word असमासे it is shown that the <i>adhikara</i> of <i>purvapada</i> ceases, and the rule applies to non-compounds also where there is no पूर्वपद ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"having ण in <i>Upadesa</i>\"? Observe प्रनर्दति, प्रनर्दितुम्, प्रनर्दकः ॥ For the root नर्द is recited in <i>Dhatupatha</i> with न ॥ There are eight such roots नर्द्, नाट्, नाथ्, नाध्, नन्द्, नक्क्, नॄ, नृत् ॥ See [[6.1.65]].",

Under certain circumstances the forms of the <i>vikarana</i> is changed from नु to नो and ना to नी, but the rule still applies, because the substitute of an अच् or vowel is like the principal. See (l. I. 57).",
    "84016": "The word आनि is the termination of the Imperative. Thus प्रवपाणि, परिवपाणि, प्रयाणि, परियाणि ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'the Imperative'?

The ऋ here, of course, means 'a word ending in ऋ', because ऋ alone cannot be a <i>purvapada</i>. The णत्व only took place during <i>sanhita</i>, and in <i>Pada</i> reading this ण would not have remained, hence this <i>sutra</i>.\n\nWhy have we used the word <i>avagraha</i> in the <i>sutra</i>? Because we have already said that the word <i>sanhita</i> governs all <i>sutras</i> of this chapter. So the न is changed to ण in the <i>Sanhita</i> state in these; and the ण is retained, when in the state of <i>avagraha</i>. The word <i>avagraha</i> in the <i>sutra</i> indicates the scope of the rule. The न is changed to ण after that ऋ only, which is capable of <i>avagraha</i>, namely that ऋ which stands at the end of a word (<i>pada</i>), and not that which is in the body of a word. Thus in नृमणाः, पितृयाणम्, the ऋ is capable of <i>avagraha</i>, as it is at the end of a word नृ or पितृ; but when it is not at the end of a word, it can never become <i>avagraha</i>, and will not produce the ण change.\n\nThe word पूर्वपदात् is understood here. The word अवग्रह means a hiatus or separation. Thus पितृ याणम्, नृ मणाः ॥ Here ऋ is अवगृह्य ॥ The change of न into ण is effected ordinarily then, when the terms, one containing the cause, and the other न, are in संहिता or conjunction. For the rules of <i>Sandhi</i> and the rules like these can apply only to words in <i>sanhita</i>. The present rule is an exception to it, and here, even when the words are not in संहिता, but there is an actual hiatus between the two, the change still takes place.

The word उरु means the word-form उरु; and षु means सुञ्, and is exhibited with ष-change. It does not mean the affix सु of the Locative Plural. Therefore, not here इन्द्रो धता गृहेषु नः ॥ The word रक्षा is the 2rd Person singular, Imperative, the lengthening is by [[6.3.135]]. The root शिक्ष् has the sense of दान in the <i>Veda</i>. कृधी is 2nd Person singular Imperative of कृ [[6.4.102]], the <i>visarga</i> of नः is changed to स् by [[8.3.50]].

The reason for this is, that if the short अ were held to differ from the long आ in this respect, the homogeneousness mentioned in [[1.1.9]], would not be found to exist between them, and the operation of the rules depending upon that homogeneousness would be debarred. In order to restore the short अ to its natural rights, thus infringed throughout the <i>Ashyadhyayi</i>, <i>Panini</i> with oracular brevity in his closing aphorism gives the injunction अ अ; which is interpreted to signify--Let short अ be held to have its organ of utterance contracted, now that we have reached the end of the work in which it was necessary to regard it as being otherwise\". (Dr. Ballantyne).\n\nThus वृक्षः, प्लक्षः ॥ In this Grammar, the अ is regarded open or <i>vivrita</i>, when operations are performed with it: but in actual pronunciation it is contracted. The long आ and the <i>pluta</i> आ ३ are not meant to be included here in the open short अ; therefore those two are not contracted by this rule. Only the short अ consisting of one <i>matra</i>, with its various modifications is to be taken here. In other words the six shorts अ are only taken here, namely अ꣡, अ॒॒, अ॑, अँ꣡, अँ, अँ॑ ॥ For these six short open अs, there are substituted six contracted corresponding अ's See (l. 1. 9)."
